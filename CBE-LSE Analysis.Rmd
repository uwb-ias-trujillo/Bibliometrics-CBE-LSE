## What social structures are organizing co-authorship. Social Network Analysis (SNA) of co-authorship


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r BibliographicData}
#Working with CBE-LSE data. 
data <- readFiles('rawdata/CBE_LSE_2008-2019/CBE_LSErecords1-733.txt')%>%
  convert2df(dbsource = "wos", format = "plaintext")
summary(data)
```

## How do different authors write about different topics? (intreraction question)

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
data <- readFiles('rawdata/CBE_LSE_2008-2019/CBE_LSErecords1-733.txt')%>%
  convert2df(dbsource = "wos", format = "plaintext")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## What are the collaborative networks between institutions?
