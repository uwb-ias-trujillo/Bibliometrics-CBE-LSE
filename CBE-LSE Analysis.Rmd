##Introduction
This is the placeholder for the introduction. This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Summary of initial data set
This is a placeholder for the inital data set
Whole group
```{r dataset}
txt <- readFiles('rawdata/CBE_LSE_2008-2019/CBE_LSErecords1-733.txt')
data <- convert2df(file = txt, dbsource = "wos", format = "plaintext")
```

## Research Questions

### Social Network Analysis (SNA) of co-authorship: What social structures are organizing co-authorship? 
Rachel Kudlacz 
This is the placeholder for the question about the social struction of co-authorship the among the CBE-LSE authors. A social network analysis approach was used...
Text to introduce the script and outputs
```{r co-authorship,echo=FALSE}
#INSERT FUNCTION FOR CREATING DOCUMENT COCITATION NETWORK using 'data' file
# Create a Social Network Analysis(SNA) Network from Co-Citation Network
NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(data, analysis = "co-citation", network = "references", sep = "; ")

# Plot the network - look into SNA application
net = networkPlot(NetMatrix, n = 200, Title = "Social Network Analysis", type = "fruchterman", size=T, remove.multiple=FALSE, labelsize = 3, edgesize = 5, edges.min = 4, label.n = 30, cluster = "louvain", remove.isolates = TRUE, label.cex = TRUE)
```

Text to explain what is shown in the figures.

### What are the collaborative connections between institutions?

Germaine Ng 

This is the placeholder for the question about collaborations between different universities (institutions)
Text to introduce the script and outputs

```{r collaborative, echo=FALSE}
#INSERT FUNCTION FOR CREATING INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK using 'data' file
UNdata <- metaTagExtraction(data, Field = "AU_UN", sep = ";")

NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(UNdata, analysis = "collaboration", network = "universities", sep = ";")

# Plot the network
net=networkPlot(NetMatrix, n = 200, Title = "University Colloboration", type = "fruchterman", size=T, remove.multiple=FALSE, labelsize=0.7,edgesize = 5, edges.min = 3, label.n = 30)

#Create an interactive graphic
g<-igraph_to_networkD3(net$graph)
forceNetwork(Links = g$links, Nodes = g$nodes, Source = 'source',
             Target = 'target', NodeID = 'name', 
             Group = 1, zoom = TRUE, bounded = FALSE)
```
Text to explain what is shown in the figures.

### What is the intellectual structures? Document co-citation network

Darcie Nelson
This is the placeholder for the question about documents frequently cited together
Text to introduce the script and outputs. 

```{r DCA, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 50, fig.asp = .618}
#INSERT FUNCTION FOR CREATING DOCUMENT COCITATION NETWORK using 'data' file
# Create a co-citation network
NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(data, analysis = "co-citation", network = "references", sep = "; ")

# Plot the network
net = networkPlot(NetMatrix, n = 200, Title = "Co-Citation Network", type = "fruchterman", size=T, remove.multiple=FALSE, labelsize = 3, edgesize = 5, edges.min = 4, label.n = 30, cluster = "louvain", remove.isolates = TRUE, label.cex = TRUE)
```
