   responsible conduct of research; responsible and ethical conduct of
   research education; research ethics instruction
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are increasingly becoming the first, and perhaps only, research experience for many biology students. Responsible and ethical conduct of research (RECR) is crucial for the integrity of scientific research and essential for students to have an understanding of the scientific process at any academic level. However, there is a current lack of RECR education in biology CUREs. To understand the level of RECR knowledge and skills in undergraduate students, we created a diagnostic survey that uses case scenarios designed to illustrate RECR issues in the CURE classroom. Analysis of students' responses indicated that the overall percentage of students who are able to effectively use RECR terminology and identify the impact of RECR violations on science integrity and ultimately on society is low. Furthermore, some students equated RECR violations to academic dishonesty, indicating difficulties separating the research and academic aspects of CUREs. This diagnostic tool can aid instructors in identifying gaps in student RECR knowledge for the subsequent development of RECR educational interventions, particularly to ensure the integrity of the research performed in CURE settings.

AB Supporting student development of clear science communication skills is critically important and incredibly challenging. In this activity, to help students understand the importance of clear written communication, students work in pairs with LEGO bricks. One student with a completed LEGO structure describes a small LEGO construction, directing a second student to build it, sight unseen. This exercise serves three aims. First, it acts as an icebreaker in the beginning of this writing-intensive course; second, it prompts thinking about the features of clear communication; and finally, it highlights challenges in written communication. The exercise is followed by a short debrief and an in-class writing assignment. Most students found the exercise to be enjoyable and useful and advised including it in future course offerings. With modifications, it also runs well in an online format, and is easily adaptable to many other course contexts.

DE COVID-19; online-learning; distance learning; academic achievement;
   student perceptions
AB The widespread disease outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 elicited mandated shutdowns of all facilities not considered essential to include academic institutions. Many educational institutions had to find a way to transition into online learning modalities rapidly. This study investigates whether a relationship between students' perceptions of online learning and their academic achievement during the coronavirus outbreak exists. We hypothesized that (i) students would rate the online modality more negatively than the in-person module, (ii) STEM courses would be rated more negatively than non-STEM courses, and (iii) there was a positive correlation between grades achieved and student perceptions of the online course modality. The study found that students rated online courses more negatively than in-person courses. There were significant differences in student achievement and perception based on the course type. The study found a weak yet positive relationship between student achievement and perception of learning modality. Future studies should continue to evaluate the effects of mandated online learning on the mastery and achievement of learning outcomes. The implications from these findings can help institutions improve e-learning modules.

AB Quantitative reasoning (QR) skills have become a critical competency for undergraduate biology students, and recommendations for curricular reform urge QR training throughout undergraduate biology programs. Much research has been directed at course design, pedagogy, and student challenges in QR, but less research has been directed toward understanding how biology faculty conceptualize the QR skills they are called upon to teach. We conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with IS participants teaching introductory biology courses to learn how faculty conceptualize QR at the introductory level. Using phenomenology, responses were coded to establish inductive codes. We found that two themes emerged from the coded conceptualizations: sophisticated, cognitively complex QR skills and basic QR skills. Participants placed emphasis on the more complex QR skills as being important in the undergraduate curriculum, beginning at the introductory level. Participants' conceptualizations of QR aligned with skills called for in curriculum reform, but the perceived notion of "basic" for some skills may not align with the literature. This suggests that more is needed in aligning faculty conceptualization of QR with curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment.

AB Biologists consider variability during biological investigations. A robust quantitative understanding of variability is particularly important during data analysis, where statistics are used to quantify variation and draw conclusions about phenomena while accounting for variation. Many students struggle to correctly apply a quantitative understanding of variation to statistically analyze data. We present quantitative and qualitative analyses of introductory biology students' responses on two pairs of multiple-choice questions querying two concepts related to the quantitative analysis of variation. More students correctly identify a mathematical expression of variation than correctly interpret it. Many students correctly interpret a non-significant p-value in the context of a very small sample size, but fewer students do so in the context of a large sample size. These results imply that many students have an incomplete quantitative understanding of variation. These findings suggest that instruction focusing on conceptual understanding, not procedural problem solving, may elevate students' quantitative understanding of variation.

TI Growsafe: A Chemical Method To Deactivate Cultivated Microorganisms
   Using Low-Cost Kitchen Supplies
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID MICROBIOLOGY
AB One limitation to engaging K-12 students and the public with microorganisms is the inability to cultivate and dispose of bacterial and fungal samples safely without expensive equipment or services. This barrier has been amplified with remote learning modalities and laboratory closures driven by safety precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At-home lab kits are being used to bring hands-on experience in microorganism cultivation to students learning remotely, but these kits often fail to take into full consideration the safety aspects or the costs associated with microorganism disposal, limiting which experiments can be performed at home. Here, we outline a method that makes cultivating and deactivating microorganisms accessible to the public through low-cost and readily available equipment. This method reduces exposure to microorganisms by forgoing the need to open petri plates for chemical deactivation with sanitizing reagents. This technique may benefit remote K-12 and postsecondary students, students wishing to get hands-on microbiology research experience, and members of the public interested in cultivating microorganisms to contribute to citizen science efforts or for creative art applications.

TI Open Inquiry versus Broadly Relevant Short-Term Research Experiences for
   Non-Biology Majors
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCIENCE; BENEFITS; PENNYCRESS; MODEL
AB Undergraduate student participation in course-based research experiences results in many positive outcomes, but there is a lack of evidence demonstrating which elements of a research experience are necessary, especially for non-biology majors. Broad relevance is one element that can be logistically challenging to incorporate into research experiences in large-enrollment courses. We investigated the impacts of broad relevance in a short-term research experience in an introductory biology course for non-majors. Students either participated in an open-inquiry research experience (OI-RE), where they developed their own research question, or a broadly relevant research experience (BR-RE), where they investigated a question assigned to them that was relevant to an ongoing research project. We found a significant association between the type of research project experienced and students' preference for an experience, with half of the students in the OI-RE group and nearly all students in the BR-RE group preferring a broadly relevant research experience. However, since science confidence increased over the course for both groups, these findings indicate that while students who participated in a BR-RE valued it, broadly relevant research experiences may not be necessary for positive outcomes for non-majors.

AB Humor is a popular tool used by instructors to engage students. However, some instructor jokes may be perceived as less funny and more offensive by particular groups of students. Previous studies have shown that student gender impacts student perception of instructor humor; however, to our knowledge no studies have explored whether there are differences in how other identity groups interpret instructor humor. In this study, we surveyed 1,637 students across 25 different college science courses at a research-intensive institution in the Southwest United States. Students evaluated a set of topics that science instructors might joke about in class as to whether they were funny and offensive. Using binary logistic regression, we analyzed whether students of different identities, including race/ethnicity, political affiliation, LGBTQ+ status, religious affiliation, and native language, differentially perceived joke topics to be funny and offensive if told by an instructor in class. We identified that topics which tended to be perceived by students as funny rather than offensive were generally less likely to be perceived as funny to non-native English language speakers compared with native English speakers. We also found that students were more likely to be offended by jokes about their own identity group. This work identifies potentially humorous topics that instructors should avoid because they could be offensive to groups of students. This study also highlights topics that tend to be perceived as funny to most students, which indicates that instructors who joke about such topics may be universally benefitting college science students.

TI Starting the Conversation: Initial Listening and Identity Approaches to
   Community Cultural Wellness
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID STUDENT; PERFORMANCE; GENEROSITY; STRATEGIES; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; RACE
AB Inclusion of multiple viewpoints increases when teams are diverse and provides value in scientific communication and discovery. To promote retention and raise the critical mass of underrepresented persons in science, all voices must be heard "at the table" to include "ways of knowing" outside the dominant institutional culture. These community-based inclusive concepts promote hearing all diverse perspectives for inclusive recognition of deeper socio-historical cultural wealth-collectively termed cultural wellness. When undergraduates and graduates in active-learning groups in class, or faculty collaborative teams on campus, start a project too quickly on task, opportunities are missed to be inclusive. While beginning a larger science project, we, student and faculty co-authors, first addressed this challenge-the need for greater inclusion of diverse perspectives-by starting a conversation. Here, we share ideas from our inclusive process. Based on social constructivist theories of co-constructing learning interpersonally, we co-mentored each other, learning from one another in community. We experientially considered how to inclusively collaborate across a demographically, geographically, and structurally heterogeneous group including multiple academic tiers from multiple ethnic backgrounds, cultural experiences, and institutions. Through an asset-based process grounded in several frameworks, we documented our introduction process of listening deeply, being mindful of identities including invisible cultural identities, recognizing each other with mutual respect, applying inclusive practices, and developing mutual trust and understanding. Building community takes time. Initial conversations can, and should, go deeper than mere introductions to build trust beyond social norms for relationships promoting cultural wellness.

TI Microbiology Education in Nigeria: Common Training Deficits Could Be
   Addressed with Modern Educational Tools
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Microbiology has developed as an important field of scientific training in Nigeria over the years. It is one of the early scientific fields introduced to the country. It has contributed to the development of the scientific identity of the country, through training of personnel and applications aimed at addressing microbial diseases that present a public health concern. Recent diseases, especially of microbial origin, have however exposed the poor state of microbiology in Nigeria. Recurrent but avoidable infectious diseases such as diarrhea and cholera have led to the loss of several lives. Although the situation is complex, at least some of these shortcomings could be compensated for by enhancing the quality of training delivered to future microbiologists and related healthcare professionals and educators. An analysis of microbiology curricula in Nigerian institutions compared with those of developed countries identified several gaps. Although inadequacy in training resources, expert faculty, and funding are well recognized, it is believed that several of these training gaps could be addressed through innovative educational approaches. In this paper, I discuss how key microbiology education weaknesses in the Nigerian context could be overcome using modern, low-cost educational tools that are accessible even in the face of existing institutional challenges. Topics such as molecular cloning and PCR are discussed, together with how specific virtual classroom and related internet-based tools can be applied to teach these topics in resource-limited contexts. This paper should therefore be relevant to microbiology educators in most developing countries.

ID COLLEGE
AB Studying abroad in agricultural biosciences can develop students' cultural, academic, and communication skills and enhance employability. However, in the United States, discussions of study abroad are limited to either one-way directionality (U.S. students to other countries) or to the experiences of international students who come to the United States for degree programs. We analyzed the perspectives and experiences of studying abroad by Zamorano University (Honduras) students who completed an agricultural bioscience pasantia (four-month internship) during the final year of their undergraduate program. We used mixed methods to collect data via focus group discussions and a survey with Zamorano students who had completed a pasantia in 2017, as well as key informant interviews with Zamorano pasantia coordinators. Study-abroad experiences were compared between students who completed their pasantia in the United States (37%) and those who completed their pasantia in any of 17 other countries worldwide. Significant relationships were identified (p < 0.05) between: doing a pasantia in the United States (compared with going elsewhere) and improving science and theoretical knowledge; having a hands-on experience and science and theory improvement; improving communication and confidence in using scientific methods. The Zamorano pasantia model lends insights into the value of study abroad for agricultural bioscience education.

AB Undergraduate students in the biomedical sciences are mostly unaware of how clinical microbiology laboratories handle suspected agents of bioterrorism or emerging infectious diseases. The Public Health Security Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 requires the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to maintain a list of microbes that pose serious biological threats to human health and safety, including Tier 1 agents with the potential for use in bioterrorism. The Laboratory Response Network (LRN), founded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories, coordinates the response of sentinel, reference, and national laboratories to these biothreats. The sentinel laboratories, which comprise most hospital-based and commercial laboratories, are the first to encounter a suspicious agent. For this reason, the LRN has published a series of testing guidelines to assist the sentinel laboratories in deciding whether a microbial isolate should be considered potentially hazardous and thus sent to a reference or national laboratory for further characterization. Here, we describe a simple laboratory exercise that teaches sentinel-level testing requirements in the context of an applied setting of a potential outbreak of anthrax that would require a sentinel laboratory to recognize a potential threat, attempt to rule it out, and refer to a national laboratory for identification.

TI Increasing student interest with the Bacterial Unknown Identification
   Project: using mixed cultures to create real-world applications
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE Bacterial Unknown Identification Project; mixed culture
AB Many introductory-level classes teach fundamental concepts, as they are prerequisites for upper-division courses. Therefore, the student body in these classes has diverse interests. To address this breadth of career trajectory, introductory-level laboratory courses often include experiments that demonstrate a wide range of microbiological techniques and processes. One of the experiments that is a standard component of many microbiology classes, the Bacterial Unknown Identification Project (BUIP), is often limited to isolated organisms or a specific environment. Here, we describe an updated method for the BUIP that incorporates the projected student career diversity through the implementation of multiple mixed cultures of microorganisms associated with different environments. This update can be utilized in any microbiology laboratory classroom. We maintained the learning objectives, including applying appropriate microbiological methods to analyze and interpret results, and effectively communicate scientific findings, while modifying the sample composition. Assessment of the modification demonstrated that upon completion of the BUIP, students felt that the project applied to their career and it did not take too much of their free time to complete.

TI Specifications Grading Is an Effective Approach to Teaching Biochemistry
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE specifications grading; biochemistry; mastery learning
ID PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES
AB Specifications grading is a relatively recent approach to assessing student learning. In this approach, students make progress toward completion of a course by demonstrating mastery of specific skills or material. The assessment tools are short, frequent exercises that can be attempted multiple times until mastered. This contrasts with the traditional, exam-based assessment of student learning. There are multiple benefits to the specifications grading-based strategy, including reduced test anxiety, better knowledge retention, and increased flexibility. In this study, specifications grading was implemented into an upper-level biochemistry course at a private, liberal arts university. The student cohort consisted almost exclusively of junior and senior biochemistry, biology, and chemistry majors. Students earned points for demonstrating mastery on each of 12 short quizzes in addition to points earned from laboratory exercises and on the cumulative final exam. Student attitudes were assessed using three surveys that were administered at the beginning, middle, and end of the course. The survey results indicated that the students had overall favorable opinions of the specifications grading approach and its use in this course. A comparison of student performance on the quizzes to their performance on the final exam showed that the students learned and retained the course material. Combining the survey and performance data, we demonstrated that the students' perceptions of their learning correlated well with their performances on the specifications grading tools. Together, these results indicated that specifications grading is an effective approach to assessing student learning and to maintaining student enthusiasm in an upper-level biochemistry course.
   Specifications grading is a relatively recent approach to assessing student learning. In this approach, students make progress toward completion of a course by demonstrating mastery of specific skills or material.

AB Education about scientific publishing and manuscript peer review is not universally provided in undergraduate science courses. Since peer review is integral to the scientific process and central to the identity of a scientist, we envision a paradigm shift where teaching peer review becomes integral to undergraduate science education. We hypothesize that teaching undergraduates how to peer review scientific manuscripts may facilitate their development of scientific literacy and identity formation. To this end, we developed a constructivist, service-learning curriculum for biology undergraduates to learn about the mechanisms of peer review using preprints and then to write and publish their own peer reviews of preprints as a way to authentically join the scientific community of practice. The curriculum was implemented as a semester-long intervention in one class and, in another class, as an embedded module intervention. Students' scientific literacy and peer review ability were assessed using quantitative methods. Student's perceptions of their scientific literacy and identity were assessed using thematic analysis of students' reflective writing. Here, we present data on the improvement in the peer review ability of undergraduates in both classes and data on the curriculum's interrelated impact on students' development of scientific literacy, identity, and belonging in peer and professional discourse spaces. These data suggest that undergraduates can and should be trained in peer review to foster the interrelated development of their scientific literacy, scientific identity, and sense of belonging in science.

AB Laboratory courses can serve as important avenues to equitably support introductory biology students to develop foundational scientific literacy skills while experiencing the authentic research process. We present a model for an equity-focused redesign of an introductory organismal biology laboratory course at a teaching institution with limited research infrastructure. We incorporated elements of inquiry, structure, and climate into our three redesigned course components: weekly research investigations, skill-building assignments, and student-designed group projects. Students were trained in the research process through weekly experiments using locally relevant model organisms, collecting and analyzing novel data and writing brief results sections in the conventions of a research journal article. Student groups then collaborated to complete a student-designed research project and poster presentation using one of the model organisms. Through weekly inquiry labs and practice in skill-building assignments, most students in the sample mastered skills in analyzing, graphing, and writing about experimental results. Notably, students mastered skills that were practiced more frequently throughout the lab course, demonstrating the value of repeated and scaffolded practice. Students reported significant gains in self-efficacy and science identity, as well as sense of project ownership. Student gains were influenced by instructor but not their major or the semester in which they took the course, and growth occurred across students regardless of their incoming score on the presemester survey. This intentional course design model, combined with consistent expectations for instructors across multiple sections, has the potential to equitably support students with a range of prior knowledge and experiences to make meaningful gains in science literacy skills during an introductory semester.

AB Clicker questions are a commonly used active learning technique that stimulates student interactions to help advance understanding of key concepts. Clicker questions are often administered with an initial vote, peer discussion, and a second vote, followed by broader classroom explanation. While clickers can promote learning, some studies have questioned whether students maintain this performance on later exams, highlighting the need to further understand how student answer patterns relate to their understanding of the material and to identify ways for clickers to benefit a broader range of students. Systematic requizzing of concepts during at-home assignments represents a promising mechanism to improve student learning. Thus, we paired clicker questions with at-home follow-up reflections to help students articulate and synthesize their understandings. This pairing of clickers with homework allowed us to decipher how student answer patterns related to their underlying conceptions and to determine if revisiting concepts provided additional benefits. We found that students answering both clicker votes correctly performed better on isomorphic exam questions and that students who corrected their answers after the first vote did not show better homework or exam performance than students who maintained an incorrect answer across both votes. Furthermore, completing the follow-up homework assignment modestly boosted exam question performance. Our data suggest that longer-term benefits of clickers and associated homework may stem from students having repeated opportunities to retrieve, refine, and reinforce emerging conceptions.

AB The COVID-19 shutdown forced many institutions of higher education to shift in-person teaching to emergency remote teaching. This was particularly challenging for laboratory courses, where students are expected to learn hands-on skills needed for their career goals. Here, we describe the transformation of an upper-division microbiology laboratory to a course that seamlessly integrates online simulations with safe, hands-on experiences that can be done from home. This blended lab course helped students attain learning outcomes similar to those achieved in the in-person class. We illustrate the implementation of Unknown Portfolios to help students gain the data analysis and critical thinking skills needed to identify an unknown microorganism. Our data show that students who took these online courses mastered material as well as students who took the lab in person, demonstrating proficiency in laboratory safety skills, hands-on techniques, and theoretical class content. Last, we explore online adaptations to enhance in-person lab classes, aiming at reducing the accessibility and equity gaps inherited in many courses, as well as discussing challenges that instructors might experience in this process.

AB Instructors want students to be prepared for class. There are several different resources and activities available to help students prepare for class, but very little is known about how students choose to prepare for class in the context of undergraduate biology. In this study, we used content analysis to investigate what students do to prepare for an introductory biology course and if and how that preparation differed under two different conditions. Students were either directed to search out and choose their resources to prepare for class (choice treatment) or assigned specific pages from a textbook (text treatment). Students in the choice treatment reported preparing for class slightly more often than students in the text treatment, with both groups reporting that they prepared for over three-quarters of classes. However, students assigned specific textbook passages engaged more while preparing than students who had to find their resources. The textbook was a popular resource but second to websites for students who got to choose. Students in both groups performed similarly in the course. This work helps instructors understand what their students may be doing to prepare for class. We provide recommendations to guide instructors on how to help their students prepare for class.

AB Advancing the field of discipline-based education research (DBER) requires developing theories based on outcomes that integrate across multiple methodologies. Here, we describe mediation analysis with structural equation modeling as one statistical tool that allows us to further examine mechanisms underlying well-documented trends in higher education. The use of mediation analysis in educational settings is particularly powerful, as learning outcomes result from complex relationships among many variables. We illustrate how mediation analysis can enhance education research, addressing questions that cannot be easily reached otherwise. We walk through critical steps to guide decision-making in mediation analysis and apply them to questions using real data to examine performance gaps in large introductory courses in biology. Through the use of mediation analysis with structural equation modeling, we add to a growing body of research that shows diverse quantitative approaches support evidence-based teaching in higher education.

AB Authors in the Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education (JMBE) have demonstrated a clear commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) through commentaries, instructional approaches, and research. However, analysis of JMBE literature using Kendi's antiracist framework (How To Be an Antiracist, 2019) offers additional opportunities for growth. These opportunities are discussed and framed under five emergent conceptual categories (ECCs). First, capitalistic goals (e.g., productivity) are often drivers for DEI initiatives but disproportionately benefit those with power. Humanity-centered reasons, like honoring community values, are also important motivations. Second, faculty are often targeted as primary agents of change for DEI, but more powerful stakeholders such as department and institutional leadership can also implement equitable policies and practices to widen the impact of DEI initiatives. Third, study scopes are sometimes focused on the outcomes of inequity (e.g., lower retention rates for students of color) rather than the systemic causes (e.g., exclusivity of science). While outcomes are important to research, studies should create clear connections and distinctions between the systems and symptoms of inequity. Fourth, active learning and authentic research experiences are not automatically inclusive and do not necessarily validate students' identities. Such approaches may be more impactful when tailored for context and student background. Finally, language and communication can have broad impacts on DEI efforts. As a community, we may need to be more critical of our shared language and communication. This review discusses the five ECCs in depth and offers next steps for supporting DEI across the biology and microbiology education community.

DT Article
ID SCIENCE; EDUCATION
AB The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020 thrust instructors into a world of frenzy, presenting unique challenges to delivering course content. Especially challenging was how to substitute wet lab experiments that often comprise science labs. Recognizing that this problem was not short term, I started to look into virtual substitutions to be implemented in the 2020-2021 academic year. Virtual simulations can replace labs, be incorporated as prelab assignments, or used as active learning or experiential learning exercises in a traditional classroom setting while providing low cost, safe and acceptable solutions to the current problem. Virtual simulations were examined in different platforms. These included Labster, McGraw Hill Connect Virtual labs, HHMI Biointeractive, Learn Genetics, Virtual Interactive Bacteriology Laboratory, and Biology Corner. The goal was to provide faculty around the world a reference list of virtual simulations that are aligned to specific AAAS and ASM student learning outcomes. These simulations are discussed here in terms of content, features, and advantages of use, as well as a list of lab exercises aligned to biology courses (microbiology, genetics, and cell biology).

TI CREARE: A Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience to Study the
   Responses of the Endangered Coral <i>Acropora Cervicornis</i> to a
   Changing Environment
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB There is mounting evidence to support that students who participate in scientific research experiences are more likely to continue on to advanced degrees and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To introduce more students to the benefits of research, we have drawn on an ongoing project aimed at understanding how the Caribbean staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis responds to environmental fluctuations to develop a semester-long course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), entitled CREARE (Coral Response to Environment Authentic Research Experience). The main mode of instruction in CREARE is through topic modules, and course evaluation is achieved through writing assignments. Students in CREARE perform experiments in the laboratory to measure the abundance of photo-protective proteins in coral tissue from samples collected at different depths and at different times of the year and analyze environmental data using the R programming language. CREARE participants have contributed to the progress of the research project by generating novel data and making improvements to experimental protocols. Furthermore, pre- and post-course assessment of content knowledge revealed that students perform significantly better on a written exam after participating in CREARE, while also displaying appreciable shifts in attitudes toward science in student perception surveys. In addition, through qualitative analysis of focus group interviews, we gathered evidence to suggest that mediating variables that predict students' persistence in science are bolstered through our application of the CURE modality. Overall, CREARE can serve as a model for developing more research-based courses that successfully engage students in scientific research.

TI Improving the Design of Undergraduate Biology Courses toward the Goal of
   Retention: The Case of Real-World Inquiry and Active Learning through
   Metagenomics
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; EFFICACY
AB Retention in science is low in undergraduate populations, especially for under-represented minority (URM) and first generation (FG) college students. Thus, educators have been called upon to design curricula to counteract this trend. This study examined variables most likely to lead to retention, such as increased achievement, improved attitudes, and self-efficacy beliefs, through participation in active learning and real-world research experiences in an introductory biology course. The research experience was embedded in metagenomics content and processes that have increasingly gained focus in microbiology. This study also investigated differences in learning outcomes when the curriculum was infused with more active learning. The active learning components included integrating interactive technology into the pre-lab lectures, providing students with authentic protocols to conduct lab work, and allowing students to rerun problematic samples. Results showed increased achievement for URM/FG students, although this was not strongly tied to the active learning elements incorporated into the three-week metagenomics research experience. However, students participating in research with more active learning did report higher frequencies of engaging in mastery experiences (an important source of self-efficacy) when compared with students engaged in research with less active learning. This analysis can aid in identifying specific curricular design features associated with promoting retention in undergraduate biology and science programs in general.

AB I describe the structure and implementation of an activity I use in academic development, aimed at introducing higher education faculty to social inequities in a profound way. The activity is structured such that previously naive practitioners as well as those somewhat engaged in equity pedagogies are provided new ways of thinking about the role classroom practices play in social inclusion. Here I reflect on the activity's genesis, provide suggestions for its use, and present considerations for academic developers interested in using it for their own practice.

TI Guidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratories Version 2.0: A Revised
   and Updated Manual for 2019
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The original Guidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratories were developed in 2012 in response to an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that originated from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. In the 7 years since the publication of the guidelines, there have been two subsequent CDC-reported Salmonella outbreaks originating from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. Use of and issues with the guidelines by ASM members have been tracked by various means since publication, and in 2018 it became apparent that an update of the guidelines was necessary. The Education Board of the American Society for Microbiology charged this task force with updating the guidelines based on the accumulated information. While the guidelines should look familiar, users will find that the originally separate BSL1 and BSL2 guidelines have been rolled into one document, to help eliminate redundancy and confusion. In addition, sections on risk assessment and service animals in the teaching laboratory have been added. These updated guidelines should help clarify many of the issues for which users expressed problems with the original guidelines.

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GENE-EXPRESSION; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; LANDSCAPE; SCIENCE
AB Epigenetics, a rapidly emerging biological science, investigates changes in gene expression without any change to the primary DNA sequence. Epigenetics plays an important role in diverse areas, including nutritional sciences, psychology, and environmental sciences. In addition, epigenetic phenomena are closely implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Even though the importance of epigenetics has been widely discussed in the literature, there is no quantitative assessment on the development of epigenetics. In this paper, we show our metadata analysis of PubMed to quantitatively measure the temporal development of epigenetics. Our analysis indicates that the publication volume of epigenetics will reach 20.7% of all genetics paper in 10 years (year 2029). Based on our analysis, we suggest that epigenetics be added to the biology undergraduate curriculum.

AB Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) expand the scientific educational benefits of research to large groups of students in a course setting. As part of an ongoing effort to integrate CUREs into first-year biology labs, we developed a microbiology CURE (mCURE) that uses a modified dilution-to-extinction high throughput culturing protocol for isolating abundant yet fastidious aquatic bacterioplankton during one semester. Students learn common molecular biology techniques like nucleic acid extraction, PCR, and molecular characterization; read and evaluate scientific literature; and receive training in scientific communication through written and oral exercises that incorporate social media elements. In the first three semesters, the mCUREs achieved similar cultivability success as implementation of the protocol in a standard laboratory setting. Our modular framework facilitates customization of the curriculum for use in multiple settings and we provide classroom exercises, assignments, assessment tools, and examples of student output to assist with implementation.

AB Travel restrictions, pandemics, economic downturn, and increasing costs in organizing workshops all impact on face-to-face training of undergraduates planning to undertake research. The inability to obtain basic, first-hand information regarding research in practice causes undue stress for students and leads to unrealistic expectations regarding research projects. Here, we describe how a student initiated online workshop, co-designed by a group of undergraduate leaders in conjunction with a panel of international academic researchers, and enabled the delivery of an introductory workshop on research training to meet student needs. Post-workshop, over 80%-95% of the participants rated their understanding of different aspects of research in practice as either being good or excellent. The design of this workshop provides an innovative template, in particular for resource-restricted countries, on how student-initiated workshops with multi-institutional academic collaboration could enhance training in research practice.

AB To improve students' scientific literacy, I designed a learning module that built upon my personal research experience and interest to actively engage students in reading primary literature. Here, I describe the scaffolded procedure in six steps, each linked to a learning outcome and assessment using Bloom's taxonomy as a framework of increasing from lower-order to higher-order cognition: (i) storytelling and discussion, i.e., remember; (ii) guided reading, i.e., understand; (iii) group reading, i.e., apply; (iv) shared reading, i.e., analyze; (v) self-selected reading, i.e., evaluate; and (vi) research proposal, i.e., create.

By using my personal science story as introduction and foundation, students were able to connect to the content and consider the importance of the process of science. By providing a scaffolded introduction and guided support, students were able to read primary literature with less frustration and with greater confidence. I assessed these activities to determine if they increased student engagement and student confidence in reading peer-reviewed scientific papers. Students completed a survey rating their confidence reading scientific papers on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Reported confidence increased following the activities (mean of 1.9 before to 3.2 after) and activities were rated as helpful (mean of 3.1). These activities can be applied to most fields of research, allowing faculty at nonresearch institutions the opportunity to incorporate their research into teaching while achieving successful general education outcomes.

AB Active learning tools, such as gamification, have facilitated teamwork and improved decision-making skills in Anatomy and Physiology classes. However, most Anatomy and Physiology labs currently contain dissection activities where students are not likely to engage in inquiry, critical thinking, or problem-solving. Usually, the instructor gives a brief lecture on the topic, and students are left to dissect without understanding how the lecture relates to what is in front of them, which is frustrating. Coupled with the frustration, some students have adverse opinions on dissecting specimens, including hesitation to dissect the specimen and religious or ethical concerns with dissection. Utilizing similar game mechanics to Taboo (Hasbro) and Milton Bradley's Operation, Incision Precision is a card game that was made to engage students in the dissection lab by allowing them to connect lecture-based information to a physical structure within an organ system. Each card contains an anatomical or physiological description of the organs commonly dissected in the undergraduate Anatomy and Physiology laboratory. For effective gameplay and full participation, the class should be divided into groups containing 3 to 4 students. The group will draw two cards where members can either correctly name the organ or identify the named organ on the dissected specimen. Playing Incision Precision resulted in participation from all group members during the dissection activity, including those with negative feelings about touching the dissected specimen. Due to positive student feedback, Incision Precision has been adapted and played with system-specific organ dissections.
   Active learning tools, such as gamification, have facilitated teamwork and improved decision-making skills in Anatomy and Physiology classes. However, most Anatomy and Physiology labs currently contain dissection activities where students are not likely to engage in inquiry, critical thinking, or problem-solving.

ID HESITANCY; TUSKEGEE
AB The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic underlined a shift in attitudes against vaccines and a rise in hesitancy among some members of the population, despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccinations are one of the most successful and safe health interventions. Research has shown that vaccine hesitancy is complex and can result from an intersectionality of multiple factors. Research has also shown that to tackle vaccine hesitancy in the community, health care workers play a pivotal role, as they are trusted sources who can provide reliable information and can address vaccination concerns for the public. Unfortunately, health care workers are also susceptible to vaccine hesitancy. Thus, to curb these negative attitudes and doubts against vaccinations, we propose to improve vaccine competency among health science students, who are the future health workforce. Here, we propose a comprehensive pedagogical approach that aims to improve the vaccine literacy in this student population in two urban community colleges. The approach includes the use of high-impact pedagogical interventions to achieve three main objectives: (i) to teach students the nature and process of science to have them become "competent outsiders"; (ii) to enhance students' knowledge of the complex science behind emerging infectious diseases and vaccine action, adopting a learner-centered and concept-focused instructional design, and (iii) to address the social, cultural, and historical aspects of vaccine development and the historical and present inequities that characterize this health intervention.

   An important part of scientific training in undergraduate curriculum involves teaching students how to effectively communicate in science. Scientific writing and oral presentations are important parts of most science classes. The same cannot be said about a new and emerging aspect of many recent scientific articles: graphical abstracts. In recent years, many scientific journals have adopted graphical abstracts as a way to capture both the scientific audience and increase visibility on social media platforms. Graphical abstracts are becoming the norm for many journals; however, there is no equivalent training in undergraduate classes that teaches students the intricate skills of efficient graphical design. In this paper, we share our course design and discuss how students can be taught to design better experiments and excel in communicating their research findings through graphical abstracts.

AB A predicted rapid growth in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers demands a vast and talented workforce, but students most commonly abandon STEM majors within the first 2 years of college. Performance in introductory courses, scientific literacy, and the ability to critically reason are main predictors of retention in STEM, highlighting the importance of precollege and early college experience. The Life Science Research Immersion Program (LSRIP) is a novel science education model that focuses on the development of scientific research skills, thus preparing students for introductory college courses and beyond. To evaluate the efficacy of the LSRIP, pre- and postprogram assessments and surveys were administered to three precollege student cohorts. Scientific reasoning assessment scores improved by 4.70% in Summer 2019 (P < 0.01), 9.44% in Fall 2019 (P < 0.05), and 0.97% in Winter 2020 cohorts, with two of five questions showing statistically significant improvement. Surveyed attitudes toward science improved in 62.9% of questions across all cohorts. These results suggest that research immersion experiences are an effective educational instrument for improving and promoting scientific reasoning and attitudes among precollege students. To better prepare students for success in STEM higher education and careers, we recommend implementing LSRIPs to complement traditional precollege science curricula.

AB The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic and distrust for popular media have highlighted the need for effective methods of direct communication of biomedical science to the public. It is presently unclear how well nonexperts can learn from primary scientific sources and what factors predict such learning in the general public. The present study examined three modalities for learning about biomedical science directly from study investigators: primary scientific articles, annotated primary scientific articles presented online with interactive learning features, and TEDTalks about scientific studies presented by a study investigator. Each modality presented the same study, "Sleep Drives Metabolite Clearance from the Adult Brain " (L. Xie, H. Kang, Q. Chen, Y. Liao, et al., Science 342:373-377, 2013, ). Knowledge about the study's scientific content was assessed before and after the randomly assigned learning modality using multiple-choice questions. Participants included a sample of college psychology students and a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Cognitive tests were used to assess individual differences in working memory, processing speed, science literacy, and semantic knowledge. Surveys were used to assess trust in science and scientists, attitudes toward science, and attitudes toward cognitive tasks. Results indicated that both younger and older adults can learn basic biomedical science from a primary source. Knowledge gains were observed in all three learning modalities with no evidence of age group differences. Notably, the largest learning gains for undergraduates and older adults were observed in the primary scientific article condition, followed by the TEDTalk, and the annotated paper. Baseline knowledge about the science study topic and adoption of "scientific attitudes " (e.g., open-mindedness) predicted learning across age groups and learning modalities. These findings suggest that science educators, communicators, and outreach professionals should consider methods of promoting science literacy in the general public through direct access to primary scientific sources.

AB Visual literacy, which is the ability to effectively identify, interpret, evaluate, use, and create images and visual media, is an important aspect of science literacy. As molecular processes are not directly observable, researchers and educators rely on visual representations (e.g., drawings) to communicate ideas in biology. How learners interpret and organize those numerous diagrams is related to their underlying knowledge about biology and their skills in visual literacy. Furthermore, it is not always obvious how and why learners interpret diagrams in the way they do (especially if their interpretations are unexpected), as it is not possible to "see" inside the minds of learners and directly observe the inner workings of their brains. Hence, tools that allow for the investigation of visual literacy are needed. Here, we present a novel card-sorting task based on visual literacy skills to investigate how learners interpret and think about DNA-based concepts. We quantified differences in performance between groups of varying expertise and in pre- and postcourse settings using percentages of expected card pairings and edit distance to a perfect sort. Overall, we found that biology experts organized the visual representations based on deep conceptual features, while biology learners (novices) more often organized based on surface features, such as color and style. We also found that students performed better on the task after a course in which molecular biology concepts were taught, suggesting the activity is a useful and valid tool for measuring knowledge. We have provided the cards to the community for use as a classroom activity, as an assessment instrument, and/or as a useful research tool to probe student ideas about molecular biology.

   The One Health initiative is a comprehensive strategy that seeks to understand the balance between the human, animal, environmental domains and how each affects the health of the others. A One Health project is presented here that can be used as a final formative and summative assignment for undergraduate students enrolled in a microbiology course. Students learn about the initiative and then choose topics of relevance. They then synthesize concepts learned throughout the course and new information about the One Health initiative. An assessment rubric is provided that can be modified to a variety of different project types, not just papers, as described here. This One Health assignment helps students learn the importance of the microbiology concepts addressed in the course and also their real-world implications.

AB Quantitative reasoning is one of the core competencies identified as a priority for transforming the undergraduate biology curriculum. However, first-year biology majors often lack confidence in their quantitative skills. We revised an introductory biology lab to emphasize the teaching of basic laboratory calculations, utilizing multiple teaching tools, including online prelab quizzes, minilab lectures, calculation worksheets, and online video tutorials. In addition, we implemented a repetitive assessment approach whereby three types of basic calculations-unit conversions, calculating molar concentrations, and calculating dilutions-were assessed on all quizzes and exams throughout the semester. The results showed that learning improved for each of the three quantitative problem types assessed and that these learning gains were statistically significant, both from first assessment to midterm and, notably, from midterm to final. Additionally, the most challenging problem type for students, calculating molar concentrations, showed the greatest normalized learning gains in the second half of the semester. The latter result suggests that persistent assessment resulted in continued learning even after formal, in-class teaching of these approaches had ended. This approach can easily be applied to other courses in the curriculum and, given the learning gains achieved, could provide a powerful means to target other quantitative skills.

AB Scientific education provides a set of tools to make sense of a complex world by teasing out complicated cause-and-effect relationships, such as the elimination of effects of confounding factors in controlled experiments. There is evidence that depth of understanding of controlled experiments is lacking among undergraduate science students despite exposure to controlled experiments in courses. To examine the understanding of controlled experiments, we developed a two-tiered assessment that includes closed-ended and open-ended questions, with three types of questions, i.e., (i) a scientific scenario about a flawed drug study, (ii) an everyday-life scenario about flawed thinking regarding product effectiveness, and (iii) a direct question about explaining controlled experiments. Consistent with previous findings, we demonstrated that large percentages of students in introductory biology courses at both a research-intensive institution and a primarily undergraduate, minority-serving institution failed to recognize the need to account for confounds. Based on these findings, we tested the hypothesis that scientific literacy could be improved through a course-based intervention using an active learning framework focused on science as a process of evaluating alternative hypotheses. We found start-to-end-of-semester improvement in students' identification of unaccounted confounds with a scientific scenario in an intervention course but not in the control course. Interestingly, students in both the control and intervention courses showed improvement when tested with a scenario based on everyday life. The study findings suggest that a concerning number of college students may not account sufficiently for uncontrolled variables in real-life situations, and we present a widely applicable instructional strategy that improves on this broadly relevant scientific reasoning skill.

TI Science Bootcamp Goes Virtual: A Compressed, Interdisciplinary Online
   CURE Promotes Psychosocial Gains in STEM Transfer Students
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES; BENEFITS; SENSE
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are well-documented as high-impact practices that can broaden participation and success in STEM. Drawing primarily from a community of practice theoretical framework, we previously developed an interdisciplinary CURE course (Science Bootcamp) for STEM majors focused entirely on the scientific process. Among first-year students, Science Bootcamp leads to psychosocial gains and increased retention. In the current study, we test whether an online Science Bootcamp also improved outcomes for STEM transfer students-a group that faces "transfer shock," which can negatively impact GPA, psychosocial outcomes, and retention. To this end, we redesigned Science Bootcamp to a 2-week course for STEM transfer students to complete prior to beginning the fall semester at our 4-year institution. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was conducted in an entirely virtual format, using primarily synchronous instruction. Despite the course being virtual, the diverse group of STEM majors worked in small groups to conduct rigorous, novel empirical research projects from start to finish, even presenting their results in a poster symposium. Assessment data confirmed the compressed, online Science Bootcamp contained key CURE components-opportunities for collaboration, discovery and relevance, and iteration- and that students were highly satisfied with the course. Moreover, in line with our hypothesis, STEM transfer students who participated in the online Science Bootcamp experienced a range of psychosocial gains (e.g., belonging to STEM). In sum, these findings suggest our online Science Bootcamp promotes positive STEM outcomes, representing a highly flexible and affordable CURE that can be scaled for use at institutions of any size.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the detrimental effects of a lack of understanding of public health measures. During the pandemic, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask mandates introduced by governments were met with skepticism, doubt, and an unwillingness to comply, increasing the extent of negative outcomes as a result. Albeit devastating, the pandemic has offered an invaluable opportunity to observe the correlation between the prevalence of public health education and compliance with public health measures during critical times. In this article, we describe a card game that was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to educate the public (including children) about how specific public health measures address the pandemic and how global cooperation is essential in addressing even one country's problems. The game can be used in primary, secondary, or tertiary education classrooms, initiating conversations about the topic and providing a basic understanding before more in-depth learning.

AB The pandemic brought a whole newfound collection of words into our everyday language, some of which had been terms that were infrequently used outside academic and medical settings. However, as familiar as this new pandemic vocabulary has become, there are still several terms that often get mixed in everyday conversations, media communications, and even in the medical field. Some of these terms are often mistaken, which may lead to issues in the understanding of important concepts. Science communication, as a facet of scientific literacy, intends to educate people in an easy-to-understand manner, and this communication is even more important in health care, when a literate patient's medical decisions depend frequently on this process. In this article, we explore the use and misuse of some of the most common terms utilized during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by nursing and medical students, i.e., future health care professionals, in the hospital environment. This single-center hospital-based cross-sectional study, performed throughout September 2022, included 30 medical and nursing students. All participants completed a self-administered 15-item anonymous questionnaire at a single time point. Nine multiple-choice questions evaluated knowledge, diagnosis, disease manifestations, and vaccines related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Six questions provided demographics and quality assessment information. The analysis of the answers indicated that for at least 75% of the population surveyed, COVID-19 literacy was better for terms related to technology and actions (3/5 questions answered correctly) than for terms related to the disease (1/4 questions answered correctly). The overall median score for questions 1 to 9 was 4.5 of 9 points in total. Based on the results, the language used in the questionnaire was considered easy to understand, with an easy to medium level of complexity, and the perceived time required to complete the questionnaire was less than 5 min. In conclusion, our results showed that efforts need to be made in continuous professional education to increase the knowledge in COVID-19 literacy in the health care environment for medical and nursing students. Larger studies are recommended to identify and to fulfill the challenges that COVID-19 brought to medical and nursing education.

However, as familiar as this new pandemic vocabulary has become, there are still several terms that often get mixed in everyday conversations, media communications, and even in the medical field.

AB In an attempt to redesign science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments to be more inclusive of all student populations, institutions of higher learning are reviewing their programs, policies, and the ways they engage students. The Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) has been working with STEM departments over the past 10 years to improve the student experience by incorporating evidence-based teaching practices and creating curricula with a deeper focus on conceptual understanding of scientific principles, competencies, and the process of science. PULSE created the PULSE rubrics, a set of five rubrics designed to assist life sciences departments in assessing their implementation of the recommendations of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Vision and Change report in the areas of curriculum, assessment, faculty practice and faculty support, infrastructure, and climate for change. An additional rubric, on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), is described in this paper. Each of the 13 criteria of the PULSE DEI rubric begins with a context section of background information with references and a scale of 0 to 4 (baseline to exemplar) with descriptors for each score. The PULSE DEI rubric has been added to allow departments to determine the starting point for their DEI work and reveal areas that require attention. All PULSE rubrics can be accessed from the PULSE Community website (https://www.pulse-community.org/rubrics).

AB Students possess informal, intuitive ways of reasoning about the world, including biological phenomena. Although useful in some cases, intuitive reasoning can also lead to the development of scientifically inaccurate ideas that conflict with central concepts taught in formal biology education settings, including evolution. Using antibiotic resistance as an example of evolution, we developed a set of reading interventions and an assessment tool to examine the extent to which differences in instructional language affect undergraduate student misconceptions and intuitive reasoning. We find that readings that confront intuitive misconceptions can be more effective in reducing those misconceptions than factual explanations of antibiotic resistance that fail to confront misconceptions. Overall, our findings build upon investigations of intuitive reasoning in biology, examine possible instructional interventions, and raise questions about effective implementation of reading interventions in addressing persistent misconceptions about biology.

ID STUDENTS
AB Research in undergraduate STEM education often requires the collection of student demographic data to assess outcomes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Unfortunately, this collection of demographic data continues to be constrained by socially constructed categories of race and ethnicity, leading to problematic panethnic groupings such as "Asian" and "Latinx." Furthermore, these all-encompassing categories of race and ethnicity exasperate the problematic "underrepresented minority" (URM) label when only specific races and ethnicities are categorized as URMs. We have long seen calls for improved outcomes related to URMs in undergraduate STEM education, but seldom have we seen our own understanding of what it means to be a URM go beyond socially constructed categories of race and ethnicity. If we aim to not only improve diversity outcomes but also make undergraduate STEM education more equitable and inclusive, we must reevaluate our use of the term "URM" and its implications for demographic data collection. The classifications of "underrepresented" and "minority" are more nuanced than simple racial categories. Though there has been development of alternative terms to URM, each with their own affordances, the main goal of this article is not to advocate for one term over another but rather to spark a much-needed dialogue on how we can "inclusify" our collection of racial and ethnic demographic data, particularly through data disaggregation and expanding our definition of what it means to be both "underrepresented" and a "minority" within STEM.

AB Microbial fermentation is a common form of metabolism that has been exploited by humans to great benefit. Industrial fermentation currently produces a myriad of products ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. About one-third of the world's food is fermented, and the brewing of fermented beverages in particular has an ancient and storied history. Because fermentation is so intertwined with our daily lives, the topic is easily relatable to students interested in real-world applications for microbiology. Here, we describe the curriculum for a guided inquiry-based laboratory course that combines yeast molecular ecology and brewing. The rationale for the course is to compare commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains, which have been domesticated through thousands of generations of selection, with wild yeast, where there is growing interest in their potentially unique brewing characteristics. Because wild yeasts are so easy to isolate, identify, and characterize, this is a great opportunity to present key concepts in molecular ecology and genetics in a way that is relevant and accessible to students. We organized the course around three main modules: isolation and identification of wild yeast, phenotypic characterization of wild and commercial ale yeast strains, and scientific design of a brewing recipe and head-to-head comparison of the performance of a commercial and wild yeast strain in the brewing process. Pre-and postassessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the course, and students enjoyed connecting microbiology to a real-world application.

AB The undergraduate general microbiology course-based research projects were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. Therefore, we developed a remote online research project that combines aspects of microbiology lectures and laboratory techniques. The project allows students to virtually travel to environmental sites to research different microorganisms. This virtual project successfully replaced the in-person laboratory experience for the duration of the semester. We revised the project with assistance from undergraduate students enrolled in the spring course. Our revised virtual project helps students develop their scientific writing and presentation skills while applying microbiology course and laboratory knowledge. The project is designed to create a more equal and equitable assessment process by including detailed guidelines and rubrics. Projects are easy to implement and can be completed within 5 to 6 weeks. The project will promote students' understanding of the process of scientific research and enrich academic development.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Online college courses can lack much-needed student interactions without live synchronous sessions. The need for socialization is particularly important for first-year students and has been of particular concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, when isolation is the new norm outside the classroom. Here we provide a perspective on the use of online synchronous sessions in a first-year biology course that encouraged student-student interactions and employed the culturally responsive teaching approach. We used group assignments, modeled on the jigsaw method, during our meetings and provided extra time outside of the dedicated class period to foster student collaboration, conversation, and social presence. We noted high attendance and participation in the synchronous sessions, suggesting effectiveness of the methods we used in student engagement and satisfaction.

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Pedagogy designed to improve student engagement, like the course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), was given its hardest challenge yet during the COVID-19 pandemic: to find a way to exist and continue productive work in a remote environment. Faculty in STEM disciplines have worked to implement CURE programs into course curriculums, only to have had some of them disrupted during spring 2020. The demonstrated benefits of the CURE in improving student engagement and persistence in the sciences could be at risk if these courses continue to be disrupted. How do faculty make CUREs work when emergency remote learning continues to loom over our institutions? This teaching tip focuses on how one antibiotic discovery CURE used technology and individual meetings to continue the student? experience and research process. The instructor remained alone in the laboratory with the student samples and acted as the students' hands, in order to continue testing and characterizing samples collected earlier in the semester, while students watched and directed the process during the online meetings. The change in methodology helped to restore some of the individual and small group mentor-type activity provided in the principal investigator-student researcher relationship present in undergraduate research experiences that was lost with the development of CUREs and the move to remote learning.

TI Increased Scaffolding and Inquiry in an Introductory Biology Lab Enhance
   Experimental Design Skills and Sense of Scientific Ability
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SELF-EFFICACY; STUDENTS; SCIENCE
AB We present a model for the process of redesigning the laboratory curriculum in Introductory Organismal Biology to increase opportunities for meaningful inquiry and increase student recognition of their scientific skill development. We created scaffolded modules and assignments to allow students to build and practice key skills in experimental design, data analysis, and scientific writing. Using the Tool for Interrelated Experimental Design, we showed significantly higher gains in experimental design scores in the redesigned course and a more consistent pattern of gains across a range of initial student scores compared with the original format. Students who completed the redesigned course rated themselves significantly higher in experimental design, data collection, and data analysis skills compared with students in the original format. Scores on the Laboratory Course Activity Survey were high for both formats and did not significantly differ. However, on written course evaluations, students in the redesigned course were more likely to report that they engaged in "real science" and their "own experiments." They also had increased recognition of their specific analytical and writing skill development. Our results demonstrate that intentional, scaffolded instruction using inquiry modules can increase experimental design skills and sense of scientific ability in an introductory biology course.

AB Inclusion is an active, powerful, and emotional noun that over the past years has helped me reconcile my main passions in life: microbiology, teaching, research, and mentoring. Although I am now part of an inclusive excellence family, during my graduate school I always felt alone, like an imposter microbiologist. I want to avoid other Latinas feeling the same way; consequently, I share frameworks and strategies here to foster inclusion in Microbiology departments. I have been teaching Microbiology for more than 20 years at a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), and my strategies range from the personal to the institutional level. As a first-generation Latina who barely survived in a Microbiology graduate program at a Primarily White Institution (PWI), I emphasize how culture can affect student learning. I use the example of microbial mats, resilient laminated ecosystems, as inclusive communities in the microbial world.

ID PARTICIPATION; EXPERIENCES; EFFICACY; SCIENCES; STUDENTS
AB Participating in research under the guidance of faculty mentors can increase undergraduate students' skills, knowledge, and confidence in conducting scientific research and pursing a scientific career. The Oklahoma IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (OK-INBRE) in the US state of Oklahoma has established an infrastructure to develop future researchers and healthcare professionals by providing students with summer internships. However, long-term benefits have not typically been well quantified, and most prior investigations examining benefits and outcomes of undergraduate summer research experiences have been descriptive and/or observational in nature. To assess OK-INBRE summer program participants, educational and career outcomes were systematically tracked. Data for evaluation included 1) primary sources containing responses to learning surveys from OK-INBRE and national cohorts over a three-year period, and 2) secondary sources from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE), that track educational outcomes of Oklahoma students over a 15-year period. Frequency statistics were compiled and bivariate analyses were conducted to examine participant academic and career outcomes. Survey responses reported higher satisfaction in various dimensions of learning among OK-INBRE students than among corresponding national cohorts, particularly on dimensions of knowledge, skills, and understanding of sciences. The OSRHE data showed that, compared with those in the control group, there was a 100% increase in OK-INBRE participants who enrolled in or had completed a professional degree (e.g., MD/DO) and a 175% increase in students attending a biomedical science graduate program. These findings demonstrate the contribution of the OK-INBRE program in promoting science education and professions.

TI Yogurt Making as a Tool To Understand the Food Fermentation Process for
   Nonscience Participants
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Designing an outreach program concerning food fermentation for nonscience participants offers an opportunity to introduce the basic principles of microbiology and their application in food preservation. This program can be adapted to microbiology courses at the undergraduate level to help students understand the concept of food fermentation and its process control. Yogurt is a type of fermented milk that is commercially available in Indonesia. While yogurt fermentation is usually performed in a closed fermenter in an aseptically controlled room, yogurt can also be made at home using lactic acid bacteria culture starters, such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, and applying proper hygiene and sanitation procedures. Yogurt making requires not only appropriate ingredients but also an understanding of the microbiological concepts of yogurt fermentation in order to enable control and modification of the fermentation process so that the end product is safe to consume. Through this activity, we provided training to residents from a nonscience background in Bogor, Indonesia, for simple and feasible homemade yogurt production using a variety of milk substrates and sources of starter culture. All participants prepared the ingredients and sanitized kitchen equipment, performed the yogurt fermentation process, and evaluated the product's sensory properties. Participants were challenged to explore the differences among various yogurt batches. This activity can be completed in two days, and the recipe could be modified once the participants have understood the concept of yogurt fermentation.

AB The concept of literacy is relevant in many areas of life, both inside and out of the classroom. With science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) being fast-growing fields, STEM literacy in particular holds an important place in today's education system and beyond. While there is not a single definition for STEM literacy, it is impacted by possible assumptions educators make about students and the learning process. These assumptions are derived from many sources, including personal beliefs, past experiences, and learning theories that individuals utilize. This paper discusses the conceptualizations of STEM literacy and related limitations within three different learning theories: information processing, constructivism, and sociocultural theory. A theoretical framework is then discussed that addresses these limitations and incorporates a sociopolitical lens on scientific literacy, for the sake of helping educators identify and adjust their own perceptions for the sake of better supporting students.

AB Biotechnology has experienced innovations in analytics and data processing. As the volume of data and its complexity grow, new computational procedures for extracting information are being developed. However, the rate of change outpaces the adaptation of biotechnology curricula, necessitating new teaching methodologies to equip biotechnologists with data analysis abilities. To simulate experimental data, we created a virtual organism simulator (silvio) by combining diverse cellular and subcellular microbial models. With the silvio Python package, we constructed a computer-based instructional workflow to teach growth curve data analysis, promoter sequence design, and expression rate measurement. The instructional workflow is a Jupyter Notebook with background explanations and Python-based experiment simulations combined. The data analysis is conducted either within the Notebook in Python or externally with Excel. This instructional workflow was separately implemented in two distance courses for Master's students in biology and biotechnology with assessment of the pedagogic efficiency. The concept of using virtual organism simulations that generate coherent results across different experiments can be used to construct consistent and motivating case studies for biotechnological data literacy.

AB Due to public health measures enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, educators and students alike have been suddenly thrust into the realm of online learning. To better understand how active and collaborative learning methods can apply to students studying in isolation, we compared the effects of two teach-and-question assignments: one that utilizes the active learning method of reciprocal peer tutoring and a solo version that requires individual verbalized studying and elaborative interrogation. We used a quasi-experimental design, with student participants enrolled in an online introductory human anatomy course. The first treatment group completed regular teach-and-question study assignments virtually with a peer, and the second treatment group completed the same assignment independently. We found no differences in exam scores between treatments, even for students with high social anxiety; however, student attitudes about the social versus individual assignment did differ for specific types of students. Students who reported experiencing high social anxiety preferred completing the active learning exercise by themselves, and students with low scientific reasoning ability preferred the partnered assignment. This research has potential implications for online classrooms. For instance, our results indicate that students who study independently, or in isolation, may have learning outcomes similar to those of students who study with a peer as long as they study actively. Because we found no negative impact on examination results, it also could be that virtually partnered or independent teach-and-question assignments could be helpful for instructors teaching large online classes to ensure all students are getting individualized feedback and attention.

AB There has always been a need for engaging assessments in online learning environments, though the COVID-19 pandemic further emphasized this need. Instructors across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines have begun to implement escape room activities as effective and engaging learning tools in their classrooms. For our virtual introductory ecology course in spring 2021, we developed a student-designed escape room assessment which aligned with several course goals and covered a broad range of ecology concepts. The learning objectives of this assignment asked students to (i) create a themed "room" filled with ecology-based riddles and puzzles that represented a novel virtual escape room for their peers based on an important ecological topic, (ii) summarize and synthesize primary literature into clues and locks to educate their peers about an ecological topic, and (iii) use critical thinking and discussion of ecological topics with peers to solve their peers' escape rooms. We found that while students generated distinct escape room activities and focused on various ecological topics, student scores on this assessment, as well as student feedback, indicated that the escape rooms were conducive to learning, novel, and accessible in the virtual learning environment. We suggest that student-designed escape room assessments are an effective way for students to learn course material in a fun, engaging, and creative manner, and our spring 2021 implementation suggests that this activity may be an effective assessment for online settings.

AB Students in higher education encounter many factors both inside (academic) and outside (nonacademic) classrooms that can influence their perceptions of stress in their biology courses. These can include course learning modalities, coursework, grades, as well as time management outside of class. It is unknown what stressors are perceived by students enrolled in biology courses-especially in online learning modalities. Therefore, our mixed method study aims to investigate the extent to which online course modalities influence students' perception of stress, as well as identify academic and nonacademic factors that influence students' perceptions of stress in biology courses. Student survey data (n = 240) was collected in the Fall 2020 semester while many courses were held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated three major findings: First, 70% of students specifically indicated that online-learning modalities increased their stress levels. Our second major finding is that 70% of students indicated the size of class workloads-work both in and out of class-is too much, which especially impacts students with caretaking and work responsibilities. Finally, over 85% of students indicated that exams were a major source of stress, specifically, a third of the students reported the time to complete the exam and exam material as sources of stress. This work is the first to identify stressors in online biology courses, and these analyses will inform future pedagogy, curriculum, and policies to mitigate students' stress as instructors continue to explore online learning pedagogy.

TI Gender Differences in Student Comfort Voluntarily Asking and Answering
   Questions in Large-Enrollment College Science Courses

AB Allowing students to ask and answer questions is a common practice employed by college science instructors. However, recent literature has identified that women participate in whole-class discussions less often than men. One hypothesized reason for this gender gap is that women may be less comfortable participating. However, no studies have examined students' comfort with asking and answering questions in large-enrollment science courses, identified what about these practices might make students uncomfortable, or explored whether there are gender differences with regard to student comfort. To answer these questions, we surveyed 417 undergraduates at an RI institution about their experiences asking and answering questions in large-enrollment college science courses. Students answered questions about the extent to which they felt comfortable both asking and answering questions and selected possible factors that could make them uncomfortable participating. Using binary logistic regression, we tested whether student demographics predicted their opinions about these practices. Over half of students reported feeling uncomfortable both asking and answering questions in front of college science classes, and women were significantly less comfortable than men both asking and answering questions. Furthermore, we identified student confidence regarding their knowledge of the material and a concern that other students would judge them as some of the primary factors that could cause students to feel uncomfortable asking and answering questions in front of the whole class. This work highlights factors that instructors can target in hopes of maximizing student comfort participating in large-enrollment college science courses.

TI Isn't It Ironic? Adapting an Elective on Quarantine and Isolation for
   Online Delivery Due to a Pandemic
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The emergence of COVID-19 and the pandemic that followed have given us a front-row seat to the debate over individual rights versus public health. There is a fine line between protecting the health of a community and maintaining civil liberties. More than a year before COVID-19 made the jump to humans, a lower-division, non-majors course was developed to explore the application and ramifications of quarantine and isolation. This 10-week class focuses on the biological and epidemiological rationale behind these nonpharmaceutical interventions, important historic examples, and the emotional, societal, and political consequences of such policies. This Quarantine and Isolation elective was included in the 2019-2020 University of Washington Bothell course catalog and was scheduled to be taught in person spring quarter; little did we know that weeks before this class would meet, Washington State would become the apparent epicenter of America's COVID-19 outbreak. As our campus followed physical distancing protocols and moved to remote emergency learning, it became necessary to shift this course to online delivery, include conversations on how this new public health crisis connected to events of the past, and best support students with their heightened levels of stress and anxiety. The goal of this paper is not only to share curriculum related to quarantine and isolation, but also to describe successful strategies for online instruction and student support during a pandemic and beyond.

ID AUTHENTIC RESEARCH; STUDENTS; COMMUNITY; IMPACT
AB Over the past decade, growing evidence has shown that there are many benefits to undergraduate students engaging in scientific research, including increased persistence in pursuing STEM careers and successful outcomes in graduate study. With these benefits in mind, there has been a significant push toward providing research opportunities for students in STEM majors. To address this need, an increasing number of undergraduate courses have been developed to provide students with research experiences in a class setting, also known as course-based undergraduate research experiences, or CUREs. Despite the growing success of these courses, a number of barriers remain that deter faculty from developing and implementing CUREs. Here, we will review the perceived challenges of developing a CURE and provide practical strategies to overcome these challenges.

AB Dissemination of results is a fundamental aspect of the scientific process and requires an avenue for publication that is specifically designed to suit the nature of the research being communicated. Undergraduate research journals provide a unique forum for students to report scientific findings and ideas while learning about the complete scientific process. We have developed a peer-reviewed, open-access, international undergraduate research journal that is linked to a course-based undergraduate research experience. We reflect on lessons learned and recommend effective approaches for the implementation and operation of a successful undergraduate research journal.

TI A Simplified but Comprehensive Laboratory Curriculum for Microbiology in
   Nursing and Allied Health (MINAH) Courses
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
AB Some U.S. nursing programs have considered or already have removed microbiology courses from their curriculum. In response to this, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) published in 2018 the Microbiology in Nursing and Allied Health (MINAH) Undergraduate Curriculum Guidelines. Parts of these guidelines include competencies and skills, which are best taught in a laboratory setting. Recognizing that some programs face a burden of running nursing/allied health microbiology lab classes, we have designed a curriculum of seven laboratories that covers the concepts in the MINAH guidelines. These labs cover aseptic technique and proper specimen collection, microscopy, enumerating microorganisms, and diagnostic tests in identifying unknowns. In addition, we provide some tips and tools for keeping down the costs of offering a microbiology lab. It is our goal that these tips and the suggested guidelines will allow microbiology to remain in the nursing and allied health curriculum.

   Technology to Study Gene Function in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

ID CRISPR/CAS9; PLANTS
AB The CRISPR-Cas9 system functions in microbial viral pathogen recognition pathways by identifying and targeting foreign DNA for degradation. Recently, biotechnological advances have allowed scientists to use CRISPR-Cas9-based elements as a molecular tool to selectively modify DNA in a wide variety of other living systems. Given the emerging need to bring engaging CRISPR-Cas9 laboratory experiences to an undergraduate audience, we incorporated a CRISPR-based research project into our Genetics class laboratories, emphasizing its use in plants. Our genetic manipulations were designed for Arabidopsis thaliana, which despite serving as a plant research model, has traditionally been difficult to use in a classroom setting. For this project, students transformed plasmid DNA containing the essential CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing elements into A. thaliana. Expression of these elements in the plant genome was expected to create a deletion at one of six targeted genes. The genes we chose had a known seedling and/or juvenile loss-of-function phenotype, which made genetic analysis by students with a limited background possible. It also allowed the project to reach completion in a typical undergraduate semester timeframe. Assessment efforts demonstrated several learning gains, including students' understanding of CRISPR-Cas9 content, their ability to apply CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools using bioinformatics and genetics, their ability to employ elements of experimental design, and improved science communication skills. They also felt a stronger connection to their scientific education and were more likely to continue on a STEM career path. Overall, this project can be used to introduce CRISPR-Cas9 technology to undergraduates using plants in a single-semester laboratory course.

AB Universities have been called upon to integrate research experiences into early, introductory courses to better prepare our STEM workforce. This call is primarily based on short-term studies that link research experiences with knowledge and perception gains. However, the influence of pre-existing student characteristics has not been fully disentangled from the research experience, and the long-term stability of these gains is uncertain. To address these issues, we integrated a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) into randomly assigned sections of a required freshman-level biology laboratory course. We previously reported that this CURE resulted in immediate targeted knowledge and perception gains. Here, we evaluate the stability of these gains as students progressed through a biology degree program. At sophomore year, the impact of the CURE on student perception was still apparent. When compared to controls, students who participated in the CURE perceived a greater understanding of what researchers do and an increased interest in pursuing a research career. However, by senior year, these positive perceptions had fallen to levels shared by control groups. Targeted knowledge gains persisted throughout this study. Our results support CURE logic models predicting that multiple CUREs will be required to sustain perception gains.

ID ENGAGEMENT
AB The central dogma of molecular biology is a key concept for undergraduate students in the life sciences as it describes the flow of information in living systems from gene-to-gene product. However, despite often being covered in many introductory life science courses, students may still have misconceptions surrounding the central dogma even as they move on to advanced courses. Active learning strategies such as laboratory activities can be useful in addressing such misconceptions. In the laboratory exercise presented here, senior undergraduate students explore the intricacies of nonsense suppressor mutations to challenge their understanding of the central dogma. The students introduce a plasmid carrying a nonfunctional chromogenic protein gene due to a nonsense mutation in a codon encoding the chromophore to various nonsense suppressor strains of Escherichia coli. Students then observe distinct chromogenic phenotypes, depending on the suppressor strain. Students showed a moderate increase in understanding of the central dogma. While the central dogma remains a challenging concept, active learning strategies like the one presented here can help reduce conceptual errors.

AB The advent of virtual reality (VR) in education offers unique possibilities for facilitating cooperative learning strategies, particularly in fields demanding intricate spatial understanding, such as gross anatomy. This study investigates the impact of integrating cooperative learning strategies within a VR-based gross anatomy curriculum, focusing on enhancing students' anatomy knowledge and skills. We analyzed the performance of two cohorts of first-year nursing students across five semesters (2016-2020), where traditional learning methods were used in the first three semesters (2016-2018), and a VR-based cooperative learning approach was adopted in the last two semesters (2019-2020). Our findings suggest that the VR-based cooperative learning group achieved significantly higher scores in their gross anatomy laboratory courses compared to their counterparts learning through traditional methods. This research provides valuable insights into how the integration of VR technology and cooperative learning strategies can not only enhance learning outcomes but also improve the VR learning experience by reducing motion sickness. It accentuates the potential of VR-based cooperative learning as an impactful educational tool in anatomy education. Future research should further explore the optimal integration of VR and cooperative learning strategies in diverse course types and their potential to enhance educational outcomes and the learning experience.

AB Climate change represents one of the biggest threats to agricultural productivity around the world. In the tropics, extreme climate and pest and disease outbreaks represent one of the biggest climate change threats to smallholder farmers. Understanding smallholder farmers' educational needs and increasing access to information and awareness of climate change through education and training are key first steps to enhance the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. In a primary effort to increase accessible training and education to these communities, we developed a plant pathology lesson plan. The lesson plan introduces basic concepts in plant pathology and disease management using diverse educational activities focused on experiential and collaborative learning. This lesson plan may have implications in enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity and increasing accessible education to underrepresented farming communities around the world.

AB Undergraduate students often struggle to understand the basics of bacterial gene regulation, a key concept in microbiology. They find it hard to visualize the architecture of a bacterial operon or how the gene, RNA, and protein components interact with each other to regulate the operon. To better visualize the molecular interactions, students engaged in a role-playing exercise on bacterial gene regulation in the classroom. Before beginning the activity, they received a shortened, traditional lecture on the architecture and function of the lac operon under "on" and "off" conditions. Students chose one or more placards detailing a molecular role (such as promoter, repressor, RNA polymerase, gene X, gene Y, etc.). Upon receiving instructor prompts, they assembled in linear order to mimic correct genomic locations of genes and regulatory elements on the operon. When given a prompt for "operon on" or "operon off" condition, students identified all the necessary components (roles) for that condition, assembled in the correct order, and then moved through the assembled operon to mimic what happens inside the cell under that condition. Students were tested before and after the activity using a set of eight multiple-choice questions. Students showed significant gains in their ability to answer these questions correctly immediately after the activity. More importantly, the improved understanding was also reflected in a high median score on summative assessments given a few weeks after the completion of the activity. This activity can also be readily adapted to online or a hybrid mode of teaching to benefit larger student populations.

AB Evolution is one of the most important concepts in biology, but it is rejected by a substantial percentage of religious students due to a perceived conflict with their religious beliefs. The use of religious cultural competence in evolution education (ReCCEE) has been shown to effectively increase evolution acceptance among religious students during in-person instruction, but there is no research that we know of that indicates the effectiveness of these practices during online instruction. In this study, we explored the efficacy of online culturally competent practices for religious students on students' evolution understanding, evolution acceptance, and comfort learning evolution at a religious university. Before and after evolution instruction, we surveyed 178 students in online introductory biology courses and compared these student outcomes to 201 students in the same instructor's in-person introductory biology courses. We found that evolution acceptance and understanding increased in online classes with culturally competent practices, and these gains were similar to those observed in the in-person courses. Despite these similarities, we found that students were more comfortable learning evolution in person than online, but this difference was small. Our findings suggest that the use of culturally competent practices online can be as effective as their use for in-person instruction for improving students' attitudes toward evolution, but in-person instruction may be more effective for cultivating students' comfort while learning evolution.

AB While many STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) instructors returned to in-person instruction in fall 2021, others found themselves continuing to teach via online, hybrid, or hybrid flexible (i.e., hyflex) formats. Regardless of one's instructional modality, the findings from our own and other studies provided insight into effective strategies for increasing student engagement and decreasing cognitive overload. As part of this perspective, we included data from undergraduate students, many of whom are first generation and low income and from marginalized backgrounds, to identify instructional practices that helped them thrive and succeed during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we explored the various pedagogies and technologies utilized during emergency remote teaching to identify best practices as we considered the future of teaching. In sharing best practices at our institution, we aimed to provide a framework for deep reflection among the readers and the identification of practices to start, stop, and/or continue at their own institutions.

ID FRAMEWORK; GOALS
AB Undergraduate research plays an important role in the development of science students. The two most common forms of undergraduate research are those in traditional settings (such as internships and research-for-credit in academic research labs) and course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Both of these settings offer many benefits to students, yet they have unique strengths and weaknesses that lead to trade-offs. Traditional undergraduate research experiences (UREs) offer the benefits of personalized mentorship and experience in a professional setting, which help build students' professional communication skills, interest, and scientific identity. However, UREs can reach only a limited number of students. On the other end of the trade-off, CUREs offer research authenticity in a many-to-one classroom research environment that reaches more students. CUREs provide real research experience in a collaborative context, but CUREs are not yet necessarily equipping students with all of the experiences needed to transition into a research lab environment outside the classroom. We propose that CURE instructors can bridge trade-offs between UREs and CUREs by deliberately including learning goals and activities in CUREs that recreate the benefits of UREs, specifically in the areas of professional communication, scientific identify, and student interest. To help instructors implement this approach, we provide experience- and evidence-based guidance for student-centered, collaborative learning opportunities.

AB At institutions with an emphasis on authentic research experiences as an integral part of the biology curriculum, COVID created a huge challenge for course instructors whose learning objectives were designed for such experiences. Moving such laboratory experiences online when remote learning became necessary has resulted in a new model for CUREs that utilizes free online databases to provide not only a novel research experience for students, but also the opportunity to engage in big data analysis. Cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal) is an open-access collective cancer research resource for storing and exploring clinical, genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. cBioPortal eliminates the computational barrier of interpreting complex genomic data by providing easily understandable visualization that can be interpreted and translated into relevant biological insights. Because no prior computational knowledge is required, cBioPortal is an ideal educational tool for either in-person or distance learning environments. We developed a pedagogical approach, video tutorials, and data analysis workflows centered on using cBioPortal. Pedagogically, students develop an initial research outline that is continually updated and graded throughout the project. Progress during the project or course is assessed by a series of student presentations that are 5 to 15 min in length and are aimed at explaining the approach used in data acquisition, interpretation of the data, and relevance to the initial hypothesis. While cancer-specific, this analysis platform appeals to a wide range of classes and student interests. Further, the project has been successfully done both as an independent research experience and as part of a virtual class-based research project.

ID THINKING; READ
AB Every instructor has concerns about effectively balancing the amount of course content with experiences to enhance a student's skills for professional success. The COVID-19 pandemic made this process even more challenging by requiring many instructors to shift rapidly from in-person to online instruction while maintaining academic integrity. The objective of this course on tissue engineering, a multidisciplinary field that aims to repair and/or replace body damage, was to increase undergraduate students' ability to read primary scientific literature and use critical analysis to creatively solve problems. Every week, a lecture covered the necessary background information to identify the current research questions and prepare students for reading the assigned research article. Students completed an analysis worksheet prior to the subsequent class, and a summary presentation followed by a student-led critical analysis discussion occurred in class. Small student groups completed an in-class thought exercise that designed several experiments that built on the article's data. The modular course design enabled a quick and successful transition to an online asynchronous modality in less than 2 weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recorded weekly lecture was posted online by the instructor, and students completed the analysis worksheet, watched a student-recorded summary presentation, and posted to a discussion board. The experimental design worksheet became an individual assignment to provide more flexibility. Pretransition and posttransition assessment showed no significant differences and provided positive proof of concept evidence. This process can be adapted to a number of topic-themed scientific courses that use in-person, online, or hybrid modalities.

TI Triage and Recovery of STEM Laboratory Skills
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID GENERAL-CHEMISTRY; IMPLEMENTATION; GUIDELINES; EDUCATION
AB The global COVID-19 pandemic left universities with few options but to turn to remote learning. With much effort, STEM courses made this change in modality; however, many laboratory skills, such as measurement and handling equipment, are more difficult to teach in an online learning environment. A cohort of instructors who are part of the NSF RCN-UBE funded Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM (STEM2) Network (a working group of faculty from two community colleges and three 4-year universities) analyzed introductory biology and chemistry courses to identify essential laboratory skills that students will need in advanced courses. Seven essential laboratory proficiencies were derived from reviewing disciplinary guiding documents such as AAAS's Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education, the American Society for Microbiology's Recommended Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology Education, and the American Chemical Society's Guidelines for Chemistry: data analysis, scientific writing, proper handling and disposal of laboratory materials, discipline-specific techniques, measurement, lab safety and personal protective equipment, and interpersonal and collaborative skills. Our analysis has determined that some of these skills are difficult to develop in a remote online setting but could be recovered with appropriate interventions. Skill recovery procedures suggested are a skills "boot camp," department and college coordinated club events, and a triage course. The authors recommend that one of these three recovery mechanisms be offered to bridge this skill gap and better prepare STEM students for upper-level science courses and the real world.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgent need for microbiology literacy in society. Microbiology knowledge, and its dissemination, can help inform and increase the objectivity of important decisions, such as treatment or vaccination. A microbiology learning experience titled "What you can't see can hurt you" was delivered as part of a larger outreach event where children were exposed to various aspects of medicine and health care fields. The activity involved an introduction to and a discussion of bacteria of clinical importance and the use of a smartphone-attachable paper-based foldable microscope. To explore the impact of this activity on participants' interest in science and microbiology, a pre- and post-activity survey of five questions on an emoji-based Likert scale was completed by the participants. A statistically significant increase in their interest in microbes and where to find them, as well as in microscopy, was observed after the event. Making microbes visible to children and allowing them to capture images of microbes exposes them directly and personally to microscopy and microbiology. An affordable low-cost paper-based microscope can become an alternative approach to teaching and learning to deliver clinical microbiology information to a wide audience range.

AB Genetic analysis in model systems using bioinformatic approaches provides a rich context for a concrete and conceptual understanding of gene structure and function. With the intent to engage students in research and explore disease biology utilizing the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans model, we developed a semester-long course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in a hybrid (online/in-person) learning environment-the gene-editing and evolutionary nematode exploration CURE (GENE-CURE). Using a combination of bioinformatic and molecular genetic tools, students performed structure-function analysis of disease-associated variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in human orthologs. With the aid of a series of workshop-style research sessions, students worked in teams of two to six members to identify a conserved VUS locus across species and design and test a polymerase chain reaction-based assay for targeted editing of a gene in the nematode and downstream genotyping. Research session discussions, responsible conduct of research training, electronic laboratory notebook, project reports, quizzes, and group poster presentations at a research symposium were assessed for mastery of learning objectives and research progress. Self-reflections were collected from students to assess engagement, science identity, and science efficacy. Qualitative analysis of these reflections indicated several gains suggesting that all students found many aspects of the GENE-CURE rewarding (learning process of research, self-confidence in research and science identity, and personal interest) and challenging (iterative research and failure, time management, COVID-19 pandemic, and life issues).

AB Being able to communicate scientifically is an important skill for students graduating with a science degree. Skills used in future graduate school and careers for science majors include oral and written communication, as well as science literacy and being able to create figures to display information. There is a consensus that these skills should be taught throughout an undergraduate science curriculum; however, many instructors have cited insufficient time to cover skills and develop materials to effectively incorporate these skills, especially into lower-level content-focused courses. Here, we present an active curriculum that can easily be incorporated into any content-focused undergraduate Cell Biology course. The curriculum is designed around scientific literature that engages students in a multitude of active learning activities to develop different types of scientific communication skills. This curriculum not only develops student skills and self-efficacy in scientific communication, it also engages them in course content and stimulates their interest in research. While making changes to a course to include scientific communication can be difficult, making small changes, such as addition of this curriculum to an already-existing content-focused course, could make a big difference in the skills and attitudes of early undergraduate science students.

   Embryonic development is fascinating to follow and highly engaging and, therefore, lends itself for undergraduate students' first steps in experimental science. We developed the "Trails to Research" inquiry-based course, which exposes students to life science research using zebrafish as model organism. Zebrafish are ideal in the classroom: they are easy to maintain, their embryos develop rapidly, and they are easily manipulated. Further, they lend themselves to teach about embryo development and experimental design. We developed the course for undergraduates at 2-year colleges and, therefore, for students with little or no research experience. In this 5-day intensive course (which is taught during summers as a stand-alone course), students design treatment experiments for zebrafish embryos with known teratogens and with substances they select. The course comprises three modules that overlap over the 5 days: (i) introduction to developmental biology, model organisms, toxicology, and experimental design, (ii) zebrafish embryo experimental setup, and (iii) collecting, analyzing, and presenting data. Student learning was significant in the areas of experimental design, working with model systems, working with zebrafish embryos, using laboratory equipment, and presenting the results of their experiments using effective methods.

AB The majority of academic institutions were underprepared for a global pandemic, leading to spikes in instructor anxiety and drops in student engagement with STEM courses. With many STEM professors teaching online for the first time, they independently sought out training in distance education and inclusive teaching practices. Had institutions been proactive in providing such professional development prior to the pandemic, the negative impacts of transitioning to online education would have been reduced. While recent events are still fresh in people's minds, we advocate for increased or maintained professional development opportunities for STEM instructors in order to protect this critical pedagogical support from budget cuts.

TI Remote Conversations to Enhance Class Experience in the Time of COVID:
   Co-Teaching with a Wingman Model
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB Remote delivery poses numerous challenges, particularly for discussion-based classes. Here, we describe a class management model that uses a conversational approach between instructional coleaders to introduce topics and facilitate student discussions. The conversational approach enabled us to model various aspects of the scientific process, such as asking questions and generating hypotheses, aimed at an emergent subject, such as COVID-19. Student's feedback was positive, noting how the class enabled them to connect their existing knowledge with the daily influx of new insights about SARS-CoV-2. While our class focuses on COVID-19-related topics, this model of a conversational style class can be easily implemented for other course topics.

DT Article
AB Remote education has become necessary to resume teaching activities during the pandemic. Most educators were not prepared for this type of teaching or did not have access to the resources required for online classes. Taking advantage of the sudden interest in the microbial world, we developed Outbreak!, a board game that can be used to support hybrid teaching, focusing on transmission and symptoms caused by viral diseases. We used the engaging potential of cooperative board games to provoke an enriching debate about the roles of both researchers and health workers during an outbreak. Educators in developing countries are in desperate need of creative and accessible tools during this unprecedented crisis. We believe Outbreak can be a useful and fun tool.

AB In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most spring 2020 university courses were abruptly transitioned mid-semester to remote learning. The current study was an exploratory investigation into the interactions among individuals within a single biology department during this transition. Our goal was to describe the patterns of interactions among members of this community, including with whom they gave advice on instruction, shared materials, co-constructed materials, and shared emotions, during the rapid online transition. We explored how instructional teams (i.e., the instructor of record and graduate teaching assistants, or GTAs, assigned to a single course) organized themselves, and what interactions exist outside of these instructional teams. Using social network analysis, we found that the flow of resources and support among instructional staff within this department suggest a collaborative and resilient community of practice. Most interactions took place between instructional staff teaching in the same course. While faculty members tended to have more connections than GTAs, GTAs remained highly interactive in this community. We consider how the observed networks might reflect a mobilization of social resources that are important for individual and departmental resilience in a time of crisis. Actively promoting supportive networks and network structures may be important as higher education continues to cope and adapt to the changing landscape brought on by COVID-19.

AB The Summer Institutes on Scientific Teaching (SI) is a faculty development workshop in which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructors, particularly from biology, are trained in the Scientific Teaching (ST) pedagogy. While participants have generally reported positive experiences, we aimed to assess how the SI affected participants' teaching practices. Building on a previously developed taxonomy of ST practices, we surveyed SI participants from the 2004-2014 SI classes regarding specific ST practices. Participants' self-reported use and implementation of ST practices increased immediately after SI attendance as well as over a longer time frame, suggesting that implementation persisted and even increased with time. However, instructors reported implementation gains for some practices more than others. The practices with the highest gains were engaging students in their own learning, using learning goals in course design, employing formative assessment, developing overarching course learning goals, representing science as a process, and facilitating group discussion activities. We propose that the ST practices showing the greatest gains may serve as beneficial focal points for professional development programs, while practices with smaller gains may require modified dissemination approaches or support structures.

TI A cost-free CURE: using bioinformatics to identify DNA-binding factors
   at a specific genomic locus

AB Research experiences provide diverse benefits for undergraduates. Many academic institutions have adopted course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) to improve student access to research opportunities. However, potential instructors of a CURE might still face financial or practical hurdles that prevent implementation. Bioinformatics research offers an alternative that is free, safe, compatible with remote learning, and may be more accessible for students with disabilities. Here, we describe a bioinformatics CURE that leverages publicly available datasets to discover novel proteins that target an instructor-determined genomic locus of interest. We use the free, user-friendly bioinformatics platform Galaxy to map ChIP-seq datasets to a genome, which removes the computing burden from students. Both faculty and students directly benefit from this CURE, as faculty can perform candidate screens and publish CURE results. Students gain not only basic bioinformatics knowledge, but also transferable skills, including scientific communication, database navigation, and primary literature experience. The CURE is flexible and can be expanded to analyze different types of high-throughput data or to investigate different genomic loci in any species.

AB Community colleges are frequently an affordable, accessible entrance to a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and career, but the transition from a 2-year program to a 4-year institution can be tumultuous. In this mixed-methods study, we explore the experiences of transfer and prospective transfer students. Through surveys and interviews, we identify the challenges faced by and the supports desired by biology transfer students. We describe how community college students perceive their introductory biology courses, and we compare the biology identity and self-efficacy of these students to peers at a 4-year institution. Students expressed uncertainty about what to expect from the transfer experience, and they benefitted from interventions that made the university experience more concrete or clarified their expectations. We found that community college students are just as interested in biology as peers at a 4-year university, but they are significantly less likely to believe that others recognize them as "biology people" and report less self-efficacy regarding biology courses. Students felt particularly well-prepared for transfer after community college biology courses they described as "rigorous" and "demanding," especially because students expressed that the community college environment helped support them through the challenges of higher education.

AB Researchers who work on course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) and issues related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) retention have begun exploring changes in student thinking about what it means to be a scientist. To support this effort, we developed rubrics to score answers to three open-response prompts: What does it mean to think like a scientist? What does it mean to do science? and Did you do real research in your coursename labs? The rubric development process was iterative and was based on input from the literature, experienced researchers, and early-career undergraduates. A post hoc analysis showed that the rubric elements map to 27 of 31 statements in the Culture of Scientific Research (CSR) framework, suggesting that scored responses to the three prompts can assess how well students understand what being a science professional entails. Scores on responses from over 400 students who were starting an introductory biology course for majors furnish baseline data from the rubrics and suggest that (i) undergraduates at this level have, as expected, a novice-level understanding of CSR, and (ii) level of understanding in novice students does not vary as a function of demography or academic preparation. Researchers and instructors are encouraged to add CSR to their list of learning objectives for CUREs and consider assessing it using the rubrics provided here.

AB At the onset of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it was clear that we needed to support public education on the science of vaccines. This project was born of that need and led to the development of comprehensive educational materials that addressed the process of science, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 biology, vaccine development, and science communication and outreach. Called the "Online Vaccine Science Resources for COVID-19 Education," the materials generated were designed to be implemented by educators and community groups in various contexts. They took the form of four modules and general audience informational videos available on a YouTube channel. Each module was assembled as a toolkit with instructional videos, assessments, discussion questions, assignments, synthesis activities, and guides for constructing infographics and dual poster (science and general public audience) presentations. The materials were piloted and tested in various educational settings, including 2-year and 4-year colleges. Data gathered from surveys of faculty and student participants suggested that exposure to the materials promoted student trust in vaccination and the scientific process of vaccine development, and increased the likelihood of their getting a freely available vaccine. Assessment data indicated that the materials were successful in helping students achieve the learning objectives for the modules. Our results underscored the continued need for science education strategies that address the critical problem of vaccine hesitancy as we continue to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB As educators, we strive to provide the best delivery method to improve our students' learning experience. The Covid-19 shutdown posed an incredible challenge by forcing us to redesign the way we teach with no time to prepare. Bringing the laboratory curriculum outside the lab was one of the most challenging tasks. Instructors got creative, adopting safe, at-home laboratory experiments, at-home kits bought from distributors, and relying on online simulations. Now that we are returning to face-to-face meetings, the experience gained during the lockdown can be harnessed and used as extra tools available for our students' learning experience. Online simulations gained attention during the lockdown and turned out to be of great value, with different studies reporting on improved students' experiences following the use of simulations. This paper outlines how to incorporate Labster simulations in an in-person microbiology semester for undergraduate students.

AB Measuring students' perceptions of active learning activities may provide valuable insight into their engagement and subsequent performance outcomes. A recently published measure, the Assessing Student Engagement in Class Tool (ASPECT), was developed to assess student perceptions of various active learning environments. As such, we sought to use this measure in our courses to assess the students' perceptions of different active learning environments. Initial results analyzed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that the ASPECT did not function as expected in our active learning environments. Therefore, before administration within an introductory biology course that incorporated two types of active learning strategies, additional items were created and the wording of some original items were modified to better align with the structure of each strategy, thereby producing two modified ASPECT (mASPECT) versions. Evidence of response process validity of the data collected was analyzed using cognitive interviews with students, while internal structure validity evidence was assessed through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). When data were collected after a "deliberative democracy" (DD) activity, 17 items were found to contribute to 3 factors related to 'personal effort', 'value of the environment', and 'instructor contribution'. However, data collected after a "clicker" day resulted in 21 items that contributed to 4 factors, 3 of which were similar to the DD activity, and a fourth was related to 'social influence'. Overall, these results suggested that the same measure may not function identically when used within different types of active learning environments, even with the same population, and highlights the need to collect data validity evidence when adopting and/or adapting measures.

ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES; FRAMEWORK
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide the same benefits as individual, mentored faculty research while expanding the availability of research opportunities. One important aspect of CUREs is students' engagement in collaboration. The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic created an immediate need for meaningful, collaborative experiences in CUREs. We developed a partnership with the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) database, WormBase, in which students submitted annotations of published manuscripts to the website. Due to the stress on students during this time of crisis, qualitative data were collected in lieu of quantitative pre- and postanalyses. Most students reported on cognitive processes that represent mid-level Bloom's categories. By partnering with WormBase, students gained insight into the scientific community and contributed as community members. We describe possible modifications for future courses, potential expansion of the WormBase collaboration, and future directions for quantitative analysis.

AB Classroom assessments needed to be rapidly modified at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as instruction transitioned from an in-person to virtual format. Yet, a significant obstacle among instructors during this time was developing online assessments that were useful, engaging, and accessible for students. We implemented a game design project in our introductory ecology course in spring 2020, in which students were required to develop a novel game based on ecology topics discussed in class. The learning objectives of this assignment asked students to (i) design a game for their peers based on an important ecological topic or concept from a specific unit or lesson in a creative manner; (ii) encourage critical thinking and discussion of ecological topics and concepts in the game; and (iii) judge their peers on the quality and enjoyment of their games. We found that while students developed various game formats and focused on different unit learning objectives, including nutrient cycling, climate change, and community dynamics, instructor and peer review indicated that the games created for this assignment were both conducive to learning and highly accessible. We suggest that a student-developed instructional games project is an effective way to engage students in an assessment that is enjoyable, collaborative, and requires creative application of the course content, in many possible biology courses and in-person and online learning environments.

AB In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic altered instructional and learning strategies at institutions across the globe. This emergency transition to remote instruction (ETRI) resulted in ambiguity regarding what to teach, how to teach, and instructor/student workload. We report on a survey-based study of 44 community college (CC) faculty at 16 institutions, with the aim of documenting how our CC faculty colleagues perceived the ETRI, the challenges they faced, and the resources that were-or would have been-most helpful. We conclude with recommendations, in the words of participating faculty, to address prevailing concerns voiced by these instructors: namely, the lack of student-faculty interactions in the online space, concerns about student access to resources, and the demand for authentic research and lab experiences.

TI From Hashtag to High School: How Viral Tweets Are Inspiring Young
   Scientists To Embrace STEM
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Social media is an increasingly important professional tool for scientists. In particular, scientists use their social media profiles to communicate science and build communities with like-minded scientists and nonscientists. These networks include journalists who can amplify social media science communication, disseminating it to new audiences on- and offline. Our experience with an outreach project where Peeps marshmallows were inoculated with diverse fungi, which we called #FungalPeeps, has demonstrated that these networks can be an effective conduit between researchers and high school students. Following popular science journalism, #FungalPeeps, a project initiated at West Virginia University, inspired a mycology research project in Notre Dame High School in San Jose, California. Herein, we describe how this connection between academia, journalists, and the high school classroom happened, and how everyone involved benefited from this educational collaboration. We further suggest ways that modern social media networks could be leveraged to incorporate more such practical learning experiences into progressive science curricula to better cultivate young STEM scientists.

TI Supporting Deaf Students in Undergraduate Research Experiences:
   Perspectives of American Sign Language Interpreters
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-HEARING STUDENTS; EDUCATION
AB Deaf undergraduates are eager to engage in research but often feel marginalized due to lack of appropriate accommodations to allow for effective communication within heterogeneous research teams consisting of hearing peers and/or mentors. In this case study, we interviewed four American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters who provided full-time accommodations to teams consisting of one deaf student and two hearing peers during a six-week internship. We queried the interpreters on their role and experiences in supporting the research teams. Our findings indicate that the interpreters can be a valuable asset to heterogeneous teams by supporting both deaf and hearing individuals and advocating for the deaf student. That said, interpreters also had to overcome challenges unique to interpreting in the research environment, such as deciding when and how to interpret. The insights provided by the interpreters interviewed here are valuable as undergraduate research programs evaluate how to provide appropriate accommodations to deaf students engaged in research. In addition, they also highlight the need for research experience coordinators and mentors to consider supporting diverse teams in developing effective communication strategies and applying universal design for learning to the research environment.

AB We report on a brief, simple, online course intervention designed to reduce identity gaps and help students see their "possible selves" in working scientists. Students (n = 238) in a large-enrollment, introductory biology course for nonmajors were assigned nine podcasts, distributed throughout the semester. These podcasts each featured a scientist telling a "true, personal story about science," and we intentionally selected podcasts featuring scientists from diverse backgrounds. We hypothesized that this intervention would serve to broaden student perceptions of science and scientists, and we used a mixed-methods approach to analyze (a) survey data and (b) short written responses about how these podcasts impacted students' views of the people who do science. Student survey responses confirm that students overwhelmingly found the podcasts valuable, engaging, and relatable, and student impressions varied as a function of student identity (gender, religiosity, sexual orientation, etc.). Further, these podcasts changed student perceptions of the sort of people who do science. This work builds on earlier findings and expands the current work to include a look at how students from a range of different identities-hidden and visible-respond to a simple intervention designed to counter stereotypes about scientists.

TI Teaching Microbiology by Celebrating Traditional Foods and Cultures from

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
AB According to a report published by the Center for Community College Student Engagement and others, global learning is considered one of the high-impact practices used to increase student engagement and motivation to learn. Engagement and motivation have also been linked to increased learning gains and improvement in the overall learning experience. Furthermore, global learning helps students explore other people's cultures and worldviews, which is an important skill for students to gain in order to compete and adapt to solve the problems of our global society. Here, I discuss two class activities that faculty can adopt to implement global learning in their courses, with the purpose of engaging and motivating students to learn microbiology while celebrating some traditions from Morocco and Peril. Students researched traditional fermented foods and drinks from Peru and Morocco. Then, they answered guided questions to help them link the food items to microbiological concepts learned in class. For example: normal flora and fermentation were learned as students researched the process of making a Peruvian drink called "chicha de Ora," which is made from chewed corn that becomes fermented as it mixes with oral bacteria from saliva. While engaging in global learning, students learned some microbiology concepts; they passed the knowledge on to the campus community with poster presentations held during International Education Week. Based on students' feedback and participation, I can conclude that teaching microbiology using global learning was engaging, promoted student learning, and motivated students to learn.

TI Comics as an Educational Resource To Teach Microbiology in the Classroom
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB New educational resources are being implemented as an initiative to foster learning. In order to contribute to the toolkit of innovative educational resources, we developed a microbiology comic book. The aim of this comic is to provide educators with a fun, accessible, and rigorous way to generate awareness of the invisible world that surrounds us and that inhabits us. Bacteria have a reputation as harmful and disgusting entities. Mass media, with advertisements of disinfectants, soaps, and house cleaning products, are sending a distorted message about microbes. We must debunk these misconceptions and emphasize the importance of microorganisms, and particularly bacteria, in the environment and our lives. Education is the means to this end, and therefore this comic is intended to help educators teach microbiology in an attractive, accurate, and straightforward way. Here, we present this educational tool and give some tips on the different themes that can be addressed in the classroom using this resource.

AB Science literacy has many personal and societal benefits that allows for better informed decision-making. Although the importance of science literacy is recognized globally, there are many challenges associated with its promotion. Scientists are more frequently engaging with nonscientific audiences through public outreach activities and with increasing support from institutions and professional societies. This is especially true regarding microbiologists and other related professionals since the start of the global 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic heightened the need to convey novel and rapidly evolving scientific information to lay audiences. The means by which professionals engage with these audiences affect the efficacy of the relay of scientific information. One method of engagement is the "ambassador approach," which aims to establish dialogue among different groups of people and scientists. In this perspective article, we discuss this approach, highlighting activities for the promotion of science literacy organized by the American Society for Microbiology Ambassador Program and similar programs of other scientific societies. We discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing an ambassador approach, propose potential improvements that could be made to existing programs promoting science literacy, and ultimately advocate for increased implementation of science ambassador programs.

AB In various formats, students at the secondary and postsecondary levels participate in multiweek authentic science research projects. There have been many papers explaining the operations of such programs, but few have provided explicit instruction on how to incorporate authentic communication practices into the student research process. In this paper, we describe how we integrated primary literature into an 8-week online research program for 8th to 11th graders. Each week, students were introduced to a specific section of a primary research article reflecting different stages of their research project, and they were guided on how to write that specific section for their own research paper. By the end of the program, students had an outline or first draft of a primary research paper based on their research. Following completion of the program, student participants reported greater self-efficacy and confidence in scientific writing. Here, we describe our approach and provide an adaptable framework for integrating primary literature into research projects.

AB Microbial activities pervasively impact the wellbeing of all organisms, including humans, and the functioning of the planet itself. In order for society to form informed opinions and take effective actions related to its welfare, it must be able to understand the causes of issues of importance and to appreciate the range of possible responses and their likely effectiveness. Society must become microbiology literate. The International Microbiology Literacy Initiative is creating a comprehensive range of teaching resources that will constitute a child-centric school curriculum of societally relevant microbiology. The core of the teaching resources, the lessons, are somewhat unusual in that each one is designed to be essentially stand-alone, so courses can be individually structured by teachers according to their perception of what is interesting and important for their charges. Moreover, the lessons deal not only with societally pertinent microbial activities, but also discuss and propose discussion of their relevance to sustainable development, of their impact on policies and decisions (personal, community, and national), and of issues of stewardship and stakeholder responsibilities. The class lessons are complemented by other child-centric teaching resources whose functions are to add value, to stimulate pupil imagination and excitement in discovery, to engage pupil interest and enthusiasm for topics like sustainability, climate change, international cooperation, citizen science, etc., and to empower pupils as stakeholders in their microbiology education and as educators and multiplicators.

ID PUBLIC TRUST; SCIENCE
AB Peer review is an important part of the scientific publishing process that serves as a key quality control step. Learning that scientific publications go through peer review builds scientific literacy and may increase trust in published findings. Though the publication and peer review process is an established part of the practice of communicating science, this topic is not commonly taught at the undergraduate level, even in classes that regularly require students to read primary literature or author manuscripts. Often, undergraduate course lessons on peer review focus on the practice of performing peer review on other students' writing rather than explaining how this process works for independent scientists publishing their novel work as primary literature articles. As a result, there is a need for more resources related to teaching about publication and peer review. This work presents a plan for out-of-class reading and an in-class lesson on peer review practices in biology. In this module, students learn the order of events in scientific publishing and consider the relationship between peer review and public trust in science by analyzing survey data. Students completing this activity reported knowledge gains related to scientific publishing and peer review and demonstrated their knowledge on an in-class assessment. Though this activity was developed for a biochemistry course, it may be implemented in various life sciences classes from introductory to advanced levels to improve student scientific literacy.

AB Today's undergraduates are tomorrow's decision makers. Many of these decisions in biological sciences can influence whether the vaccines for the next pandemic will be effective, whether the mitigation efforts will have any impact on climate change, or whether we can produce enough food for the rapidly increasing human population while fighting the next pest outbreak. These informed decisions will need to be made by scientifically literate humans, including health professionals, politicians, and media personalities, who are currently undergraduates in our courses. Students in introductory biology classes can build a strong science literacy foundation by learning how to find, evaluate, read, discuss, and cite scientific evidence. An interconnected, multistep framework that uses library guides, active learning methods, group discussions, and collaborative learning is being used for nearly a decade in Investigative Biology and has been shown to significantly improve students' perceived science literacy and science communication skills. In this article, we share basic guidelines about how to implement this framework in one long laboratory session or in consecutive lectures. The flow of the proposed exercises has been tested and adjusted based on students' feedback and the authors' experiences, and a wide variety of resources are being shared to help the successful implementation of this framework in courses that would like to train the next generation of science-literate biologists.

In study 1, in surveys administered over several academic quarters, students consistently reported that TQTs helped them transfer course content to exams and the real world; that multiple (two to five) examples were generally needed to understand a given TQT, leading >40% students to create their own additional examples; and that TQTs would be helpful in other science courses. In study 2, among 100 peer-reviewed lessons published by CourseSource or the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science (NCCSTS), less than 5% of lessons gave students advice about exams or helped students create additional practice problems. The latter finding is not meant as criticism of these excellent lessons, which are a boon to the biology education community. However, with TQT-like prescriptions generally absent from peer-reviewed lessons, biology instructors may wish to supplement the lessons with TQT-like strategies to explicitly connect the material to subsequent exams.

AB Bacterial characterization is an important aspect of microbiology that includes experimentally determining growth rates, environmental conditions conducive to growth, and the types of energy sources microorganisms can use. Researchers use this information to help understand and predict an organism's ecological distribution and environmental functions. Microbiology students generally conduct bacterial characterization experiments in their coursework; however, they are frequently restricted to model organisms without ecological relevance and already well-studied physiologies. We present a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) curriculum to involve students in characterization of previously untested, ecologically relevant aquatic free-living bacteria (bacterioplankton) cultures to identify the usable nutrient substrates, as well as the temperature and salinity ranges conducive to growth. Students use these results to connect their organism's physiology to the isolation environment. This curriculum also exposes students to advanced microbiology methods such as flow cytometry for measuring cell concentrations, teaches them to use the programming language R for data plotting, and emphasizes scientific communication through writing, speaking, poster creation/presentation, and social media. This CURE is an attractive introduction to scientific research and was successfully tested with 187 students in three semesters at two different universities. Students generated reproducible growth data for multiple strains across these different deployments, demonstrating the utility of the curriculum for research support.

   learning; URMs; art; non-traditional assessments; minority-serving
   institution
AB Students majoring in non-STEM fields often identify introductory biology courses as irrelevant and overly rigorous. Resistance to enroll in a required general education science course, coupled with negative attitudes toward the subject, can adversely affect the academic performance of students; this can especially be present in students from under-represented minority groups. Therefore, instructors have to intentionally design a curriculum that overcomes these factors as they educate non-major students enrolled in introductory biology. BioArt, a learning community, was formed between introductory biology and introduction to graphic design courses to improve the attitudes and academic performance of students in the biology course at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The BioArt model incorporated a common theme, project-based learning, and opportunities for experiential learning. To measure outcomes, traditional examinations, non-traditional assessments, failure/withdraw rates, and student attitudes were evaluated. Using this model, introductory biology became less intimidating, more relevant, and improved academic success among freshman minority students. Thus, the BioArt model can be utilized as an intervention at different institutions of higher learning.

AB Summer undergraduate research experiences (SUREs) provide important onramps to secondary STEM graduate degrees and subsequent careers. Studies demonstrate that these experiences increase the likelihood of students advancing to a graduate-level STEM degree, positively impact STEM identity and confidence, and imbue a sense of professional belonging. In 2020, COVID-19 shutdowns eliminated many in-person SUREs. In response, we launched the National Summer Undergraduate Research Project (NSURP). While NSURP addressed an immediate need for a flexible research experience, we found that this model extends access to underrepresented minorities because it provides authentic research experiences for students who are unable to travel to a research location, and/or who have familial responsibilities that necessitate a flexible work model, and/or students facing financial challenges. What began as an emergency summer research program for undergraduates to address laboratory closures resulted in what we believe is a necessary and normalized addition to the undergraduate STEM training and preparation repertoire.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in nearly all universities transitioning their in-person courses to online instruction. Recent work from our research team conducted in Spring 2020 established that the immediate transition to online learning presented novel challenges for students with disabilities: students were unable to access previously established accommodations and there was a lack of information from Disability Resource Centers (DRCs) about adapting accommodations to online environments. In this study, we aimed to determine the extent to which these issues still were present 1 year later. In Spring 2021, we conducted a survey of 114 students with disabilities who were registered with the DRC and taking online science courses at a public research-intensive institution. We used our previous interviews with students to develop closed- and open-ended questions to assess the extent to which students with disabilities were being properly accommodated in their courses, document any new accommodations they were using, and elicit any recommendations they had for improving their experiences in online science courses. We used logistic regression to analyze the closed-ended data and inductive coding to analyze the open-ended data. We found that more than half of students with disabilities reported not being properly accommodated, and this was more likely to be reported by students who experienced new challenges related to online learning. When students were asked what accommodations they would have wanted, students often described accommodations that were being offered to some students but were not universally implemented. This study summarizes recommendations for making online science learning environments more inclusive for students with disabilities.

AB We previously developed and assessed "The Art of Microbiology,' a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) which uses agar art to spur student experimentation, where we found student outcomes related to science persistence. However, these outcomes were not correlated with specific activities and gains were not reported from more than one class. In this study, we explored which of the three major activities in this CURE-agar art, experimental design, or poster presentations-affected student engagement and outcomes associated with improved understanding of the nature of science (NOS). The Art of Microbiology was studied in three microbiology teaching laboratories: at a research university with either the CURE developer (18 students) or a CURE implementer (39 students) and at a community college with a CURE implementer (25 students). Our quasi-experimental mixed methods study used pre/post-NOS surveys and semi-structured class-wide interviews. Community college students had lower baseline NOS responses but had gains in NOS similar to research university students post-CURE. We surveyed research university students following each major activity using the Assessing Student Perspective of Engagement in Class Tool (ASPECT) survey but did not find a correlation between NOS and activity engagement. Of the three activities, we found the highest engagement with agar art, especially in the CURE developer class. Interviewed students in all classes described agar art as a fun, relevant, and low-stakes assignment. This work contributes to the evidence supporting agar art as a curricular tool, especially in ways that can add research to classrooms in and beyond the research university.

TI Three Steps to Adapt Case Studies for Synchronous and Asynchronous
   Online Learning
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has ushered in a renewed interest in science along with rapid changes to educational modalities. While technology provides a variety of ways to convey learning resources, the incorporation of alternate modalities can be intimidating for those designing curricula. We propose strategies to permit rapid adaptation of curricula to achieve learning in synchronous, asynchronous, or hybrid learning environments. Case studies are a way to engage students in realistic scenarios that contextualize concepts and highlight applications in the life sciences. While case studies are commonly available and adaptable to course goals, the practical considerations of how to deliver and assess cases in online and blended environments can instill panic. Here we review existing resources and our collective experiences creating, adapting, and assessing case materials across different modalities. We discuss the benefits of using case studies and provide tips for implementation. Further, we describe functional examples of a three-step process to prepare cases with defined outcomes for individual student preparation, collaborative learning, and individual student synthesis to create an inclusive learning experience, whether in a traditional or remote learning environment.

TI Application of the Salient Practices Framework for Undergraduate
   Research Mentoring in Virtual Environments
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Undergraduate research is an excellent example of student engagement that leads to numerous benefits for the student and faculty. However, for students to gain the most from the experience, high-quality mentorship is needed. This article introduces readers to the Salient Practices framework, which is based on a comprehensive review of the research on undergraduate research mentorship as well as models of mentoring applied to the undergraduate research context. This article outlines how a group of faculty applied a mentor constellation model and adapted the Salient Practices framework to the virtual environment that resulted from COVID-19, creating a rich professional development experience for all participants. Lessons learned from initial efforts to mentoring in the virtual environment are also discussed. Implementation of mentoring in a virtual context opens up opportunities for increased access and broadening of research teams and mentoring constellations.

ID CRITICAL-APPRAISAL SKILLS; KNOWLEDGE
AB STEM curricula often prepare students with fundamental knowledge, allowing students to have strong backgrounds in technical concepts. However, upper-level students may lack the ability to critically analyze primary research articles, which is important for understanding the current state of the field. Journal clubs can be used within the classroom to facilitate discussion of recent work and teach students to critically analyze research and data. Traditional journal clubs (JCs) are conducted in face-to-face classrooms and consist of presentations and discussions. It is possible to adapt these techniques to form virtual Journal Clubs (vjCs) when courses are taught fully online; however, student engagement is often lacking and can lead to less knowledge gained in vjCs. In this article, we summarize several key teaching tips and best practices which we used to increase student engagement in vjCs. We found that vjCs, compared to JCs, equally increased student perceptions of their skills in reading, analyzing, and critiquing scientific literature and decreased their perceived levels of stress and frustration.

ID SCIENCE
AB The inclusion of undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) on the teaching team of a course is a high-impact practice that benefits the teaching team, students, and LAs themselves. LAs are undergraduate students who have taken the course previously and support student learning through facilitated discussion and problem-solving. Unfortunately, in the quick pivot to emergency remote instruction and lacking an online model for LA programs, some instructors temporarily discontinued or scaled down their LA programs. This report describes the recruitment, training, and roles of LAs who were engaged to support a high-enrollment, interactive lecture course delivered by emergency remote instruction. This case study can serve as a model to inform the implementation of a robust online LA program.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide a way for students to gain research experience in a classroom setting. Few examples of cell culture CUREs or online CUREs exist in the literature. The Cell Biology Education Consortium (CBEC) provides a network arid resources for instructors working to incorporate cell-culture based research into the classroom. In this article, we provide examples from six instructors from the CBEC network on how they structure their cell-culture CUREs and how they transitioned the labs to online. in the spring semester of 2020. We intend for these examples to provide instructors with ideas for strategies to set up cell culture CUREs, how to change that design midterm, and for creating online CUREs in the future.

TI Maintaining Student Engagement during an Abrupt Instructional
   Transition: Lessons Learned from COVID-19
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID BIOLOGY COURSES; RELEVANT; CONTEXT; ISSUES
AB Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many colleges and universities announced an abrupt transition to remote learning during the spring 2020 semester. In this report, we discuss the instructional changes that were implemented in an undergraduate microbiology course at a small liberal arts college as a result of this transition. The effectiveness of these curricular changes was assessed using a standard course feedback instrument to understand student attitudes and perceptions. Our results indicate that the switch to a thematic focus enhanced the course and specific instructional changes, including the use of preclass introductory videos and electronic forums, were useful and informative. Based on these findings, we propose that relatively minor changes to instructional strategies may enhance remote learning. Moreover, these same changes could be used to improve in-person classes.

ID SELF-EFFICACY; SCIENCE SURVEY; ATTITUDES; PARTICIPATION; SENSE;
   INVOLVEMENT; CLASSROOM; MODEL; NEED
AB We examined how the shift in learning environment from in-person to online classes, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted three constructs of student engagement: behavioral engagement, including students' frequency of participating in class discussions, meeting with instructors, and studying with peers outside of class; cognitive engagement, including students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy; and emotional engagement, including students' attitudes toward science, their perceived value of the course, and their stress. Seventy-three undergraduate STEM students from across the country completed five-point Likert-style surveys in these areas of student engagement, both prior to their science course transitioning online and at the end of the spring 2020 semester. We found that while overall behavioral engagement did not change, students participated less frequently in class discussions (P=0.0063) but met with professors more often outside of class (P=0.0358). We saw no significant change in cognitive engagement, indicating that while students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy ideally increases over the course of the semester, in this case, it did not. Most alarmingly, we found a significant decrease in emotional engagement (P=0.0075), with students reporting a drastic decline in positive attitudes toward science (P<0.0001). Student's reported stress levels remained unchanged and students reported a slight increase in their perceived value of the science course they were taking. These data shed light on how the transition to online learning had an overall negative impact on undergraduate student engagement in science courses.

DT Article
AB Faculty development workshops are frequently used to bring about change in faculty teaching. Yet, the characteristics of successful faculty professional development in the context of laboratory teaching are unclear. In this Perspective, we describe our approach to intensive hands-on faculty development workshops for fostering change in laboratory teaching and present evidence for the effectiveness of the approach. The outcomes from our workshops and feedback from past participants support the following recommendations: 1) faculty should attend workshops in teams from their institutions, 2) workshops should allow participants to develop curricula that can be implemented with relatively little additional work after the workshop, 3) workshops should allow faculty time to "work" on tangible products and should involve hands-on activities, 4) workshops should be of sufficient duration to allow for faculty to develop expertise and tangible products but short enough that faculty do not "burn out," and 5) a structure for ongoing and systematic follow-up with participants is essential.

TI Ten tips for developing a more inviting syllabus
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE syllabus; syllabi; inclusive; equitable; inviting; student-instructor
   relationship
AB In higher education, syllabi have traditionally served as written contracts between instructors and their students, providing first-hand information about the course and expectations. Reading the syllabus may provide students with first impressions or mental images of the instructor, thereby initiating a student-instructor relationship even before any interaction has occurred. Instructors can use syllabi to directly communicate values and practices of equity and inclusion, but students can perceive indirect messages through tone and language that may support or contradict stated values. Here, we share empirically derived recommendations for improving the tone of syllabi with inviting language and stylistic features that promote relationship-building with students.

AB In this digital age in which social media use among young adults continues to rise, consideration of the impact of these platforms on our students and on science literacy pedagogy is essential.

   In this digital age in which social media use among young adults continues to rise, consideration of the impact of these platforms on our students and on science literacy pedagogy is essential. This has been highlighted during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic, when mis- and disinformation surrounding the pandemic and vaccinations were so prevalent on social media platforms that it provoked a cautionary announcement from the World Health Organization. We describe here the structure of an assignment aimed to promote science literacy by encouraging students to explore antivaccination stances on social media and evaluate the scientific validity of such claims using scientific literature. To comprehensively analyze these antivaccination sentiments, we encouraged students to develop succinct arguments to demonstrate the social, economic, or other cultural influences likely contributing to antivaccination stances. In alignment with the philosophical-educational concept of Bildung, we hope to nurture an understanding of scientific literacy that focuses on both evidence-based critical thinking as well as empathetic understanding of the socio-political circumstances that influence public opinion on scientific matters. Student work provided compelling evidence for the success of our field-tested assignment in fostering students to be authoritative voices of science in everyday life and highlighted the importance of efforts to explicitly focus on science literacy within biology curricula.

AB Communicating science effectively is an essential part of the development of science literacy. Research has shown that introducing primary scientific literature through journal clubs can improve student learning outcomes, including increased scientific knowledge. However, without scaffolding, students can miss more complex aspects of science literacy, including how to analyze and present scientific data. In this study, we apply a modified CREATE(S) process (Concept map the introduction, Read methods and results, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze data, Think of the next Experiment, and Synthesis map) to improve students' science literacy skills, specifically their understanding of the process of science and their ability to use narrative synthesis to communicate science. We tested this hypothesis using a retrospective quasi-experimental study design in upper-division undergraduate courses. We compared learning outcomes for CREATES intervention students to those for students who took the same courses before CREATES was introduced. Rubric-guided, direct evidence assessments were used to measure student gains in learning outcomes. Analyses revealed that CREATES intervention students versus the comparison group demonstrated improved ability to interpret and communicate primary literature, especially in the methods, hypotheses, and narrative synthesis learning outcome categories. Through a mixed-methods analysis of a reflection assignment completed by the CREATES intervention group, students reported the synthesis map as the most frequently used step in the process and highly valuable to their learning. Taken together, the study demonstrates how this modified CREATES process can foster scientific literacy development and how it could be applied in science, technology, engineering, and math journal clubs.

AB Student-performed assessment correction is a well-established practice in the field of teaching and learning. This practice engages students in the feedback process and promotes active learning, which may be particularly important when serving underrepresented minority students. There is a dearth of research into the role of assessment correction in student learning outcomes (SLOs) in science courses, particularly at minority-serving institutions. Students at a Native American-serving, primarily undergraduate rural institution were allowed to perform test corrections for each of the three exams given during the term in an undergraduate introductory biology course. Students received the graded test back and were given I week to answer the following questions: what was your original answer, why did you choose that answer/ what were you thinking at the time, why is the answer wrong, what is the correct answer, why is it the correct answer, and what is your source of reference if different from the textbook? The students were administered a comprehensive final exam at the end of the course that determined the number of SLOs passed. A Pearson correlation and a bivariate regression analysis were performed to determine if the number of test corrections performed (TC) during the term influenced the number of SLOs passed for all students, lower-achieving students, and higher-achieving students in the study. The TC correlated with, and could predict, SLOs passed for lower-achieving students only. This preliminary analysis suggests that performing test corrections may benefit lower-achieving students.

AB American Society for Microbiology Curriculum Guidelines highlight the importance of enabling students to think critically and learn by doing research. Moreover, information in biology, especially genetics and biotechnology, increases too rapidly for instructors to teach everything. To increase students' interest and comprehension of important core genetic concepts and to encourage students to practice scientific investigation, we designed a research module for upper-level biology/genetics students to examine oral bacteria. Students extracted their own oral microbial DNA and amplified and analyzed with general genus- and species-specific 16S rRNA PCR primers. The microbial DNA samples were also amplified with conserved bacteria 16S rRNA primers and the amplicons TOPO cloned (topoisomerase-based cloning) and Sanger sequenced. Lastly, the metagenomic microbial DNA samples were also sequenced by Illumina next-generation sequencing and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. We have implemented the module in three iterations of an undergraduate class at a small, liberal arts college. The project culminates in a poster presentation that the students on average performed in a high B range. Pre- and postsurvey analysis of student learning gains revealed significant student learning (P < 0.05 one-tailed, paired Wilcoxon signed ranked test, n = 23). Next, we surveyed student perceptions of the activity by a self-assessment. Significantly more than the medians, the students enjoyed the inquiry-driven module and considered it more effective in teaching about PCR and other molecular genetics concepts than the traditional prescribed laboratory exercises. We conclude that this microbe laboratory module induces research interest and is useful in teaching important genetics concepts.

TI Impacts of a COVID-19 E-Service-Learning Module in a Non-Major Biology
   Course
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Educators need to create an informed scientifically aware citizenry, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, where public health measures have focused on increasing adoption of safe behaviors for reducing the transmission of COVID-19. Non-major science students make up an important, yet understudied, part of our public, given that they constitute tomorrow's voters, workers, consumers, and policy-makers. Expecting that non-majors may benefit from a module connecting COVID-19 to community education, we implemented a novel E-service-learning module in light of the transition from an in-person course to an online platform. Our 4-week module included expert-led lectures, assigned digital infographics about COVID-19 safety precautions, and a required post-reflection assignment summarizing their learning gains. Out of 112 enrolled students, 87 consented to have their reflections analyzed and 8 students chose to participate in additional one-on-one online interviews. In an effort to determine which parts of our module garnered the most student commentary, we grouped post-reflection and interview data into four categories: service-learning infographic, service-learning guest lectures, information on COVID-19, and the broader implications of COVID-19. While 13% of students explicitly referenced infographics in their reflections, a far greater proportion (37%) explicitly referenced learning gains related to the expert-led lectures. Based on these findings, we encourage other educators to continue to explore the impact of E-service-learning content and assignments to help maximize learning in an online classroom environment during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

TI Critical Online Service-Learning Pedagogy: Justice in Science Education
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TUSKEGEE; GAPS; RACE
AB In the year 2020 the world changed dramatically. We went from busy lives spent largely away from home to spending most of our time at home while daily facing deepening national crises. With the violent, needless death of George Floyd, the simmering tensions around race in America boiled over, sending thousands into the streets to protest racial injustices. The world of science education has largely avoided discussing racism in our classes, but we can no longer ignore it. The events of the spring and summer have highlighted our need to integrate conversations and reflections on justice into science education. In this work we argue that service learning can build this understanding from both theory and experience. Utilizing a critical online service-learning framework, we have developed a service-learning course that incorporates dialogic communication, cross-contextual reflections, and positioning oneself as an ally. This perspective allows science and the community to prioritize relationships, humanity, and reflect on our roles as professionals, utilizing the online interacting space. This course, taught at the beginning of the pandemic, focuses on critical online service learning for those studying public health. We discuss the challenges we faced moving critical service-learning pedagogy online, and the compounding issues brought on by the pandemic itself.

FX We thank our associated centers and team members for all the work they
   have done to ensure that this course was realized. This work is a
   collaboration between the SOURCE Community Engagement and
   Service-Learning Center led by Mindi Levin, the R<SUP>3</SUP> Center for
   Innovation in Science Education (R<SUP>3</SUP>ISE) led by Gundula Bosch,
   PhD, and the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) at the Johns Hopkins
   Bloomberg School of Public Health. We thank program directors Mindi and
   Gundula who played an integral role in the development of this course.
   This course innately relies on online technologies and therefore its
   development depended upon the assistance of CTL instructional design
   manager Kathy Gresh and senior instructional designer Mia Lamm. Without
   Kathy and Mia and the rest of the CTL team we would not have been able
   to develop the technologies for this course including the videos and
   podcast-like conversations. We also need to thank our teaching assistant
   Elise whose dedication, time, and attention helped our students feel
   included and added to the success of this course. All members of our
   team, Mindi, Gundula, Elise, Kathy, and Mia, were invaluable to the
   process, without their hard work this would not be the dynamic and
   engaging course we are proud to have produced. Service learning
   intrinsically requires community partners, and we are so thankful for
   ours. Alex and Melodie were true collaborators, bringing their time and
   expertise to this course. Without their passion and insights this course
   would not exist. Finally, we also thank the JHU Provost's Office for
   funding this work through the Digital Education and Learning Technology
   Acceleration (DELTA) Grant and The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health
   Institutional Review Board for IRB approval. The authors have no
   conflicts of interest to declare.

AB Introducing undergraduate students to major human diseases is a key focus of many parasitology courses. Here I present a multifaceted active learning technique that familiarizes students with major human parasitic diseases while simultaneously exposing students to a range of important medical, biological, and ecological concepts. This approach involves a combination of reading and analysis of primary literature, oral presentations and in-class discussions, films, and microscopy skills and could be modified for a range of different courses and teaching styles.

TI Does Repetition Matter? Analysis of Biology Majors' Ability to
   Comprehend Journal Articles Across a Major
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; STUDENTS; LEARN; THINKING
AB The ability to read and critically analyze the primary literature is a core skill necessary for future success in scientific fields. While many studies have described methodologies to teach journal reading, no studies examine how much practice and repetition is required before students learn how to comprehend a journal article. Here we assessed student journal reading and comprehension throughout an undergraduate biology major, analyzing students in six upper-level elective courses, some of which had no journal reading requirements while others had extensive requirements built into the course. We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between number of articles read in a semester and student ability to comprehend the articles, as well as their comfort and confidence with journal reading. Surprisingly, we found that the number of articles required for a class did not affect overall student reading comprehension and critical thinking even though students self-assessed that they gained comfort and confidence with articles as the number increased. Instead, we found that sophomore students in their first upper-level biology course showed significant gains in learning when the course activities include journal article readings. After this initial gain, there were no significant learning gains in future years, no matter the number of journals required in the course. Together, the results shown here indicate that it is not necessary to revise an entire curriculum to improve students' journal reading and critical thinking skills. Instead, early intervention and exposure to critical journal article reading is most important for this skill development.

AB We qualitatively investigated ways in which undergraduates unpacked their perceptions of STEM careers after attending a seminar series that introduced them to diverse scientists. Using Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) as a guiding framework, we explored how culturally-specific realities impacted students' career choices. Our findings suggest that familial ties and cultural expectations played key roles in determining how students navigated career choice. Our results have implications for how institutions navigate career pursuit discussions with students.

TI Principles and Strategies for Effective Teaching: A Workshop for Pre-
   and Postdoctoral Trainees in the Biomedical Sciences
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The 2012 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biomedical Workforce Working Group Report documented that graduate training in the biomedical sciences predominantly prepares people for academic research positions. The report recommended that NIH provide funds for institutions to develop broader career development opportunities, including training related to teaching. Indeed, teaching is not only a required component of any faculty position, it is the primary task for trainees who seek employment at small liberal arts colleges and other primarily undergraduate institutions. NIH funding for the BEST (Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training) programs allowed us to develop a six-week training workshop for bioscience trainees to introduce participants to research-based, student-centered pedagogies and instructional design techniques and to inspire them to view teaching as an intellectual endeavor. The methods and outcomes of our case study should be applicable in a variety of programs and organizations, especially those with a separate health science campus, where faculty mentors often do not teach many classes and there are few, if any, apprenticeship-teaching opportunities for trainees.

This activity, "Histology Personal Trainer" helps students not only identify major tissue types, but reflect on how they identified them. This activity aims to improve student performance by exercising the students' observation and comparative skills in combination with a self-reflection activity that helps to identify successful and unsuccessful identification strategies. By the end of the activity, students should be able to adapt their approach to obtain more accurate answers. This activity was used in an anatomy and physiology course, but could be modified for use in various STEM classes.

TI Influence of CUREs on STEM retention depends on demographic identities

AB Research has shown that undergraduate research experiences can have substantive effects on retaining students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). However, it is impossible to provide individual research experiences for every undergraduate student, especially at large universities. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have become a common approach to introduce large numbers of students to research. We investigated whether a one-semester CURE that replaced a traditional introductory biology laboratory course could increase retention in STEM as well as intention to remain in STEM, if the results differed according to demography, and investigated the possible motivational factors that might mediate such an effect. Under the umbrella of the Authentic Research Connection (ARC) program, we used institutional and survey data from nine semesters and compared ARC participants to non-participants, who applied to ARC but either were not randomly selected or were selected but chose not to enroll in an ARC section. We found that ARC had significant effects on demographic groups historically less likely to be retained in STEM: ARC participation resulted in narrowing the gaps in graduation rates in STEM (first vs continuing-generation college students) and in intention to major in STEM [females vs males, Persons Excluded because of Ethnicity or Race (PEERs) vs non-PEERs]. These disproportionate boosts in intending STEM majors among ARC students coincide with their reporting a greater sense of student cohesiveness, retaining more interest in biology, and commenting more frequently that the course provided a useful/valuable learning experience. Our results indicate that CUREs can be a valuable tool for eliminating inequities in STEM participation, and we make several recommendations for further research.

AB The Fly-CURE is a genetics-focused multi-institutional Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) that provides undergraduate students with hands-on research experiences within a course. Through the Fly-CURE, undergraduate students at diverse types of higher education institutions across the United States map and characterize novel mutants isolated from a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster. To date, more than 20 mutants have been studied across 20 institutions, and our scientific data have led to eleven publications with more than 500 students as authors. To evaluate the impact of the Fly-CURE experience on students, we developed and validated assessment tools to identify students' perceived research self-efficacy, sense of belonging in science, and intent to pursue additional research opportunities. Our data, collected over three academic years and involving 14 institutions and 480 students, show gains in these metrics after completion of the Fly-CURE across all student subgroups analyzed, including comparisons of gender, academic status, racial and ethnic groups, and parents' educational background. Importantly, our data also show differential gains in the areas of self-efficacy and interest in seeking additional research opportunities between Fly-CURE students with and without prior research experience, illustrating the positive impact of research exposure (dosage) on student outcomes. Altogether, our data indicate that the Fly-CURE experience has a significant impact on students' efficacy with research methods, sense of belonging to the scientific research community, and interest in pursuing additional research experiences.

AB This case study was designed to help students explore the molecular mechanisms of the spliceosome and how SARS-CoV-2 impacts host cell spliceosomal function while interpreting figures from primary literature (A. K. Banjeree, et al., Cell 183:1325-1339, e1-e10, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.004). "Pete and the Missing Scissors" was designed and implemented in the spring of 2022 and fall of 2022 in two large-enrollment (150+) introductory molecular biology courses at a large, public research institution. The case study was formatted in alignment with the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science (NCCSTS) framework, which has been shown to be an effective, student-centered approach to teaching complex biological concepts at the undergraduate level. The case study had four student learning objectives (SLOs) that aligned with Bloom's Revised Taxonomy and required students to develop an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of splicing and analyze and interpret a figure from primary literature. Both formative and summative assessment questions are included in this activity, with each question mapping to one of the case study SLOs. Summative assessment questions were given in a pre-/post-manner, and a paired t-test was used to evaluate differences between students' pre- and post-assessment scores. Assessment results demonstrated that students in both courses mastered each of the SLOs of this case study, given the significant increase in post-assessment scores compared to the pre-assessment. These findings indicate that the "Pete and the Missing Scissors" case study is an effective approach to develop students' understanding of the spliceosome, as well as ability to interpret figures from primary literature.

TI Chatbot responses suggest that hypothetical biology questions are harder

AB The biology education literature includes compelling assertions that unfamiliar problems are especially useful for revealing students' true understanding of biology. However, there is only limited evidence that such novel problems have different cognitive requirements than more familiar problems. Here, we sought additional evidence by using chatbots based on large language models as models of biology students. For human physiology and cell biology, we developed sets of realistic and hypothetical problems matched to the same lesson learning objectives (LLOs). Problems were considered hypothetical if (i) known biological entities (molecules and organs) were given atypical or counterfactual properties (redefinition) or (ii) fictitious biological entities were introduced (invention). Several chatbots scored significantly worse on hypothetical problems than on realistic problems, with scores declining by an average of 13%. Among hypothetical questions, redefinition questions appeared especially difficult, with many chatbots scoring as if guessing randomly. These results suggest that, for a given LLO, hypothetical problems may have different cognitive demands than realistic problems and may more accurately reveal students' ability to apply biology core concepts to diverse contexts. The Test Question Templates (TQT) framework, which explicitly connects LLOs with examples of assessment questions, can help educators generate problems that are challenging (due to their novelty), yet fair (due to their alignment with pre-specified LLOs). Finally, ChatGPT's rapid improvement toward expert-level answers suggests that future educators cannot reasonably expect to ignore or outwit chatbots but must do what we can to make assessments fair and equitable.

AB We developed a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) that gives students an opportunity to practice the process of science in a context that intersects with their everyday lives: purchasing grocery store chicken.

   We developed a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) that gives students an opportunity to practice the process of science in a context that intersects with their everyday lives: purchasing grocery store chicken. Student mastery of concepts was assessed by pre- and postassessment questions and lab report worksheets that guided them through the process of writing a scientific paper. Learning to produce graphs from large data sets and comparing the results with published data emphasized quantitative reasoning, while working as a group and writing helped students practice scientific communication. Most students (>90%) met the learning objectives, and students in both groups reported feeling more confident producing graphs and figures; they also showed large gains in confidence and interest in bioinformatics. Lab protocols require biosafety level 2 safety guidelines; however, students in an online or dry lab setting can use the compiled data sets and whole-genome sequences to complete the objectives. Group discussions and essay prompts at the end encourage students to use evidence-based arguments to make decisions that impact the global issue of antimicrobial resistance.

   Scientific literacy is built on critical thinking. The postbaccalaureate workforce enhances our economies and societies by contributing a wealth of knowledge and skill sets to local communities, respective industries, and beyond as our world becomes increasingly interconnected. Education in scientific literacy should teach students how to learn about science and how to cultivate and communicate a positive attitude about science. Learners in a 200-level nonmajors biotechnology course engaged with a series of ethical dilemmas after mastering the basic elements of argument structure and advanced tools in argument evaluation. To introduce collaboration as a constructive process in undergraduate education, student interactions with peers require guidance, flexibility, and compassion to learn from each other. Students gain critical thinking mastery from two modules addressing how we argue and evaluate claims. Students apply these critical thinking skills to various ethical arguments involving responsible conduct of research training. Using our structured and interdisciplinary approach, new scholars learn through practice how to read, analyze, and evaluate research scenarios and respond to potential ethical situations. This strategy allows students to develop important scholarly skills, including a systematic approach to evaluating credibility and applying generosity to theirs and others' understanding of their circumstances.

AB Laboratory exercises for undergraduates that involve authentic discovery and research have been shown to increase student learning and engagement. To bring these advantages into the microbiology curriculum, we developed a semester-long course-based undergraduate research experience for a laboratory based on brewing beer with wild yeast. This set of lab exercises uses many of the same protocols found in traditional microbiology lab curricula-isolating and maintaining pure cultures, staining and microscopy, use of aseptic technique, PCR, gel electrophoresis, and media preparation-and integrates them into a novel and exciting project that enables students to be active participants in the scientific method. Students are assessed on their ability to brew beer successfully and to stain and visualize microorganisms; they are also assessed for knowledge gains in the traditional portion of the course, their ability to use their brewing knowledge in other settings, and their attitudes about science. After completing the course, students showed gains in general microbiology knowledge and their engagement with science.

AB Methylothon is an inquiry-based high school learning module in microbial ecology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics that centers around pink-pigmented plant-associated methylotrophic bacteria. Here, we present an overview of the module's learning goals, describe course resources (available for public use at http://methylothon.com), and relate lessons learned from adapting Methylothon for remote learning during the pandemic in spring of 2021. This curriculum description is intended not only for instructors but also for microbial ecology researchers with an interest in conducting K-12 outreach. The original in-person version of the module allows students to isolate their own strains of methylotrophic bacteria from plants they sample from the environment, to identify these using PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis, and to contribute their strains to original research in a university lab. The adapted version strengthens the focus on bioinformatics and increases its flexibility and accessibility by making the lab portion optional and adopting free web-based tools. Student feedback and graded assignments from spring 2021 revealed that the lesson was especially effective at introducing the concepts of BLAST and phylogenetic trees and that students valued and felt inspired by the opportunity to conduct hands-on work and to participate in community science.

AB To achieve meaningful learning experiences in online classrooms, students must become self-regulated learners through the development of effective study habits. Currently, there is no set of recommendations to promote study habits in online biology learning environments. To fill gaps in our understanding, a working group associated with a research coordination network (Equity and Diversity in Undergraduate STEM, EDU-STEM) convened virtually in June 2021. We identify student barriers to self-regulated learning in online environments and present eight practical recommendations to help biology educators and biology education researchers apply and advance evidence-based study habits in online courses. As higher education institutions continue to offer online learning opportunities, we hope this essay equips instructors with the knowledge and tools to promote student success in online biology coursework.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide students with opportunities for the same gains that apprenticed research with faculty members offers. As their popularity increases, it is important that critical elements of CUREs be supported by thoughtful design. Student experiences in CUREs can provide important insights into why CUREs are so effective. We present evidence from students who participated in CUREs at the introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels, as well as from graduate teaching assistants for an introductory lab course that included a CURE. Students and teaching assistants describe repetition as a valuable element in CUREs and other laboratory experiences. We used student work and open-ended interviews to identify which of five previously described elements of CUREs students found important. Because repetition was particularly salient, we characterized how students described repetition as they experienced it in courses that contained full-length CUREs or "micro-CUREs." In prompted interviews, students described how repetition in CUREs provided cognitive (learning concepts) and practical (learning technical skills) value. Recent graduates who had participated in CUREs at each level of their biology education were particularly aware that they placed value on repetition and acknowledged it as motivational in their own learning. Many students described repetition in metacognitive terms, which also suggests that as students advance through laboratory and CURE curricula, their understanding of how repetition supports their learning becomes more sophisticated. Finally, we integrated student descriptions to suggest ways in which repetition can be designed into CUREs or other laboratory courses to support scientific learning and enhance students' sense of scientific identity.

AB Media reports suggest the switch to online courses due to COVID-19 has "demotivated" undergraduates. Our semester-long study of motivation for biology was in progress when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. We analyze changes in student (N = 182) motivation from before and after. Across variables, subgroups of students changed in adaptive and maladaptive ways; some remained stable. In cross-tabulations, one significant difference was found by sex, and a number of adaptive and maladaptive differences by race and socioeconomic status (SES). Despite obvious burdens on low-SES groups, undergraduate motivation was affected positively and negatively in this sample; only some variables were related to intention to remain in STEM.

ID PEDAGOGICAL DISCONTENTMENT; ANATOMY; REFORM
AB The Community College Anatomy and Physiology Education Research (CAPER) project is a 2-year grant that provides a variety of professional development opportunities to community college instructors of Anatomy and Physiology in the United States. Instructors who participate in the CAPER project also take part in a larger research study that uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to track the instructors' progress with adapting new teaching methods into their classrooms. When the COVID-19 pandemic caused global disruption to daily life, there were two cohorts of community college instructors participating in the CAPER project. While the immediate impact of the pandemic on community college instructors was not the subject of the original research project, the data from 12 in-depth interviews conducted in the midst of the pandemic revealed rich insights into teacher beliefs and attitudes, adaptation methods, and online learning as an opportunity for change during a global pandemic. This subset of the data also speaks to the importance of the CAPER project for professional development, as community college instructors in the CAPER program used their new skills to integrate active learning techniques in the online learning environment. In this article, we analyze community college instructors' adaptations to online learning through the lens of conceptual change theory.

ID STUDENT; ONLINE
AB The sudden switch from predominantly in-person to remote learning across all levels of education due to the COVID-19 pandemic posed many challenges, including transitioning in-person active learning efforts to an online format. Although active learning has increased student engagement in science, it can be challenging to effectively integrate into remote courses. Adapting in-person classroom approaches to maintain timely and effective communication, provide equitable access to course materials, and encourage class participation in remote environments proved especially difficult for many instructors engaging in remote learning during the pandemic, often for the first time. As instructors of in-person undergraduate introductory biology courses, we present three different solutions developed during the pandemic to address the challenges of adapting an experiential hands-on activity, an interactive lab, and a research project for remote learning. We found that instructors can leverage the flexibility of the online environment and use existing remote tools to expand active learning possibilities and create meaningful classroom connections, even at a distance.

AB Access to 3D printing and other "maker" technologies has opened new doors for the creation of classroom activities using physical models. Multiple strategies for implementing 3D-printed models exist, and work to define best practices is ongoing. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of common strategies for employing physical models in undergraduate biology courses and describe a novel strategy that we have developed to pair 3D-printed models with guided inquiry learning to create inclusive and interactive learning experiences. We further introduce the STEM BUILD website, a resource that we have developed to facilitate collaboration among instructors, makers, researchers, and Universal Design for Learning experts and reduce barriers to broad implementation of inclusive kinesthetic learning activities.

AB Written communication is a key research skill, yet the current model of pre- and postdoctoral training in the biomedical sciences lacks consistent formal training in this area, leading to crises of confidence when tackling research writing. A 15-hour non-credit workshop, "Secrets of Successful Scientific Writing," was developed in collaboration with an experienced instructor of scientific writing. The workshop consisted of six 2.5-hour sessions and was offered six times; a total of 126 trainees attended over these six offerings. Topics included strategies to engage the audience, principles of psychological linguistics to maximize sentence effectiveness, conventions of biomedical journal writing, technical writing and the history of scientific publishing, and two sessions on grant writing. Student confidence in and familiarity with targeted writing skills were assessed by self-evaluation questions administered immediately before and after each session. The workshop was determined to be effective at improving the confidence of participants regarding specific writing skills in the biomedical sciences, with all but two of the measures showing that the workshop had a large effect size. We conclude that a short, structured workshop can help improve the confidence and knowledge of pre- and postdoctoral writers, preparing them to better meet the writing challenges of their professional careers.

TI A Validated Novel Tool for Capturing Faculty-Student Joint Behaviors
   with the COPUS Instrument
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TEACHING PRACTICES; IMMEDIACY
AB The Classroom Observation Protocol Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) tool was developed to quantify the time instructors and students engage in various activities within STEM courses. We offer a matrix of joint instructor-student behaviors rather than a pie chart of individual behaviors as an alternative perspective on the presentation of the results from the COPUS instrument. We suggest that the presentation of the results using this matrix tool allows for finer-scale insights into the learning environment in a classroom. Using this matrix tool, we identified four profiles of instructor-student behavior in undergraduate STEM classes at our regional comprehensive Master's institution: lecture, lecture plus (lecture with students posing questions to the instructor), standing clickers/IF-ATs (immediate feedback assessment technique-instructor poses questions using some form of immediate response method but does not move around groups), and roving groups (requiring instructor to move between groups). Prior to using the COPUS instrument we placed each of the observed faculty along the active learning spectrum. Our matrix tool was validated by alignment of the matrix tool profiles with these a priori designations. We offer suggestions regarding how this matrix tool can be best used to inform faculty professional development to move instructors along the active learning spectrum.

TI Applying a Computer-Assisted Tool for Semantic Analysis of Writing: Uses
   for STEM and ELL
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In addition to human, close reading of student text with rubrics for assessment, educators use nonhuman, distant computer-assisted tools to help quantitatively measure otherwise qualitative keywords to prevent bias in grading and help read beyond the sentence for underlying cognitions. We apply the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool to analyze different forms of student writing used in STEM education and research to assess writing of native English speakers and non-native English Language Learners (ELLS), including international students. Available in several languages, LIWC measures four summary variables, Analytical Thinking, Clout, Authentic, and Emotional Tone, to provide outputs as raw word counts, as percentages of words used relative to the text compared with a dictionary of words in categories and sub-dictionaries, and as scores correlating these words algorithmically based on a dictionary of terms associated with underlying meanings. This tool can help measure student personal reflective writing for underlying psychosocial indicators or the cognitive and analytical process in other science writing. By selecting key variables, or creating a personal dictionary, LIWC can be used to analyze scientific writing to detect progressive development of student analytical writing from early draft to final version for different informal and formal writing styles. We share methods, examples, and the potential for using LIWC measures of cognitive processes for different measures of student writing in science courses.

AB Science outreach programs that enable real-time interactions between scientists and school-aged children are known to positively impact learning gains and students' perceptions of scientists. To expand K-12 outreach by scientists, it is important to build structured outreach programs which offer scientists well-defined opportunities, while providing school students regular and diverse interactions. We describe Talk To A Scientist, a science outreach platform in India, where scientists use a webinar-based approach to share their research with K-12 students (6 to 16 years). Running weekly for nearly 3 years, Talk To A Scientist has hosted over 100 live interactions, with a wide reach to participants across the country. Here, we outline the framework used to build Talk To A Scientist and discuss key gains, considerations, and challenges in the development of the program. We also suggest potential adaptations with which this framework can serve as a guideline for the implementation of similar K-12 outreach programs across diverse country- and context-specific settings.

   Three Unique Case Studies during Emergency Remote Teaching

AB Studies have documented that men's voices are generally heard more than women's voices in face-to-face undergraduate biology classes, and some performance gaps have also been documented. Some of the few studies on gender equity in traditional online biology education suggest that women participate more and perform better in asynchronous online courses compared to men. While much is known about emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing inequities generally, studies are needed about the impact of specific emergency remote teaching practices on specific groups such as women. In this study, we performed an in-depth investigation of three life sciences classrooms that utilized synchronous online lectures during the pandemic. We observed each class throughout the semester, quantified participation behaviors, and investigated the role of student gender. We also compared final course grades by gender. On average, we found that men participated more than women both verbally and by chat. These differences were not significant for each class individually, but the differences align with the face-to-face patterns seen in this population previously. Our results also hint that men's chat comments may be more likely to be acknowledged than women's chats by peers. We found evidence of greater performance disparities favoring men than seen previously before the pandemic, but not in all classes. We discuss implications for instructors conducting emergency remote teaching as well as the need for larger studies to test the replicability of our results.

TI The Effect of Specifications Grading on Students' Learning and Attitudes
   in an Undergraduate-Level Cell Biology Course
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

   grading strategy; cell biology; higher education
AB Specifications (specs) grading is a grading system in which mastery of specific educational outcomes is the basis for the final grade a student earns in the course. Implementation of the types of assessments used for specs grading has shown to be beneficial for student learning and motivation compared to traditional grading systems. We designed a specs grading strategy in an undergraduate Cell Biology course, creating 20 individual learning outcomes (LOs). The grade earned in lecture depended on the number of LOs the student mastered. If students were unable to master the content on their initial attempt, they could earn retakes for each LO assessment by completing an assignment associated with the information covered in that LO. A student's final class grade was dependent on the number of LOs mastered combined with the grade earned on their final exam. Here, we present how specifications grading was implemented in Cell Biology, differences in overall grade distribution between grading systems, improved performance on content-related assessment questions in sections using specifications grading, and more-positive attitudes for sections using specifications grading than for traditionally graded sections.

AB Students' ability to accurately judge their knowledge is crucial for effective learning. However, students' perception of their current knowledge is often misaligned with their actual performance. The relationship between learners' perception of their performance and their actual performance on a task is defined as calibration. Previous studies have shown significant student miscalibration in an introductory biology course: students' predicted exam scores were, on average, significantly higher than their actual scores. The goal of this study was to determine whether completion of a practice test before exams would result in better performance and calibration. The hypothesis was that students who completed a practice test would perform better and be better predictors of their performance on exams than students who did not engage in practice testing. As predicted, students who voluntarily completed a practice test, on average, performed better and were more calibrated than students who did not. Importantly, however, many of the lowest-performing students continued to significantly overestimate their knowledge, predicting higher scores on the exam than they actually earned, despite feedback from practice tests. In contrast, practice testing was associated with underconfidence in high-performing students. These findings indicate that practice tests may enhance calibration for many students. However, additional interventions may be required for the lowest-performing students to become better predictors of their performance.

TI Remote Laboratory Exercise to Develop Micropipetting Skills
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The rapid spread of COVID-19 has fundamentally transformed our educational system. The need to protect both students and instructors from exposure to viral infection has required the implementation of remote instructional models. Although this alternative delivery approach can be successfully implemented to teach the theoretical foundations of multiple disciplines, teaching technical skills poses a major challenge, particularly in various biology fields, where observation of biological safety guidelines and the high cost of analytical equipment represent major impediments for remote instruction. To overcome this problem, we have developed a laboratory exercise to teach students how to use micropipettes that can be completed remotely using materials that can be purchased at a fraction of the cost of the instructional equipment normally reserved for in-person instruction. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of this remote lab indicated that the majority of students who participated in a survey believed they attained the learning objectives and felt confident in their lab technique after completing the exercises. The simplicity, relatively low cost, and effectiveness of this approach makes it highly adaptable for other classrooms and educational settings.

TI Exploring the Effects on Student Learning and Engagement of COVID-19: An
   Innovative and Interdisciplinary Approach
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB Educators are tasked with developing new pedagogical, communication, and assessment strategies to ensure the delivery of quality instruction to students. The nexus that exists between student engagement and teaching methods has been a sustained and distinct focus for higher education institutions. However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced institutions to adjust to distinct functionalities. With the shift to fully online models, there exists an opportunity to engage both faculty and students in innovative teaching-learning assessments and processes. Despite the myriad of challenges that COVID-19 introduces, our paper presents effective strategies, namely, the pedagogical community's focus on opportunities for student ownership in the learning process, the chance to engage students using an innovative social media strategy discussion format, and the formulation of syllabi that incorporate interdisciplinary strategies. Models that actively engage both sides of the educational spectrum will be catalysts for reform. We propose an educational structure that fosters inclusivity in the context of five focused domains: preassessments, prospective socioeconomic gaps, pedagogy, psychological health of students and faculty, and pandemic assessment.

AB As the world deals with a pandemic, there remains another global challenge that cannot be ignored. Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be justified, as we are trying to treat a novel disease condition, which, in turn, could lead to an increase in antimicrobial resistance. We can decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs by controlling antimicrobial resistance, but it requires antimicrobial stewardship. Major components of effective and timely antimicrobial stewardship are diagnostic stewardship, infection prevention and control, and integration of COVID-19-specific flags into electronic health records, all of which may be integrated into current strategies of COVID-19 mitigation and management. Going through the influenza season of 2020, implementation of antimicrobial stewardship education efforts in the United States can help us contend with influenza in addition to COVID-19 and any bacterial coinfections or secondary infections. Additional solutions include the development of vaccines, alternative therapies, such as antibodies, and advanced diagnostics using advances in genomics and computer science.

TI Impact of COVID-19 Curricular Shifts on Learning Gains on the
   Microbiology for Health Sciences Concept Inventory
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ONLINE
AB As a validated assessment, the Microbiology for Health Sciences Concept Inventory (MHSCI) is a valuable tool to evaluate student progress in health sciences microbiology courses. In this brief analysis, we survey MHSCI faculty users and report student MHSCI scores to determine the impact on student learning gains of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent quarantine in spring 2020. Although a majority of students reported moving to a fully online lecture and lab microbiology course in the spring 2020 semester, there was no statistically significant impact on student outcomes reported by the MHSCI, and by some measures, student learning gains increased in the semester students moved to online learning. Further research is necessary to determine the continuing impact of online lecture/lab courses on student outcomes on the MHSCI. Our analysis of data from spring 2020 shows that the MHSCI is still a statistically reliable measure of student misconceptions and overall difficulty scores for each item on the MHSCI was unchanged due to the pandemic.

TI A Food Microbiology Classroom Activity to Draw Connections between

DT Article
AB Fermented foods have been prepared for millennia and every society around the world has traditional fermented foods and/or beverages that are identified with that culture. This is an excellent opportunity to help students draw connections between their everyday lives and the microbial sciences. At the same time, this is also a great way to encourage cultural awareness and acceptance. This manuscript describes an active learning approach used in a general microbiology course to encourage students to learn about fermented foods from around the world and share their discoveries with their colleagues. As a group we also spend time discussing some of the lesser known roles microbes have in food preparation such as the production of food additives or in modifying starting ingredients. At the end of the semester, students have the opportunity to sample a variety of foods associated with microbes in a "microbe lunch". We will also describe the use of similar activities in outreach to foster dialogue between scientists and the general public.

TI Simply InGEN(E)ious! How Creative DNA Modeling Can Enrich Classic
   Hands-On Experimentation
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID TEACHERS; STUDENTS; SCHOOL
AB Innovative 21st-century methods for teaching biology should provide both content knowledge and diverse scientific competencies. The Curriculum Guidelines of the American Society for Microbiology highlight the importance of developing scientific thinking skills, which include the abilities to formulate hypotheses, to communicate fundamental concepts effectively, and to analyze and interpret experimental results. Additionally, contemporary science education should enhance creativity and collaboration as key student assets in its bid to overcome negative perceptions and learning difficulties. In recent years, the expanding movement for so-called "STEAM" approaches (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) has increased in STEM curricula. The movement seeks to integrate the arts into science classes to transfer enthusiasm, support individual self- sufficiency, and encourage creative solutions. To meet all these demands, we developed an inquiry-based approach that actively engages students in hands- and minds-on activities on the topic of "decoding the DNA structure" in an outreach laboratory. Since teaching abstract molecular phenomena is a challenge in biology classes, we combine classical experimental tasks (DNA isolation, gel electrophoresis) with creative modeling. The experiments are linked by the modeling phase: immersed in the story of the discovery of the DNA structure, our participants independently construct a DNA model from a box filled with inexpensive craft supplies (e.g., glue, straws, pipe cleaners, beads). After initial pilot testing, the implementation of our approach clearly produced short- and mid-term learning effects among the students, providing a successful example of a STEAM-based approach in a laboratory setting.

AB In addition to developing innovative research programs, life science research faculty at research-intensive institutions are tasked with providing career mentoring and scientific training to new generations of scientists, including postgraduate, graduate, and undergraduate students. In this essay, we argue for a redefinition of mentoring in laboratory research, to thoroughly distinguish three essential roles played by research faculty relative to their trainees: advisor, educator, and supervisor. In particular, we pay attention to the often unacknowledged and misunderstood role of a faculty member as a supervisor and discuss the impact of neglecting supervisory best practices on trainees, on the diversity of the academic pipeline, and on the research enterprise. We also provide actionable frameworks for research mentors who wish to use inclusive supervisory and pedagogical practices in their laboratory. Finally, we call for more research around the supervisory role of research faculty and its impact on trainees, particularly community college students, in order to help broaden the participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields.

AB Many national reports have called for undergraduate biology education to incorporate research and analytical thinking into the curriculum. In response, interventions have been developed and tested. CREATE (Consider, Read, Elucidate the hypotheses, Analyze and interpret the data, and Think of the next Experiment) is an instructional strategy designed to engage students in learning core concepts and competencies through careful reading of primary literature in a scaffolded fashion. CREATE has been successfully implemented by many instructors across diverse institutional contexts and has been shown to help students develop in the affective, cognitive, and epistemological domains, consistent with broader meta-analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of active learning. Nonetheless, some studies on CREATE have reported discrepant results, raising important questions on effectiveness in relation to the fidelity and integrity of implementation. Here, we describe an upper-division genetics course that incorporates a modified version of CREATE. Similar to the original CREATE instructional strategy, our intervention's design was based on existing learning principles. Using existing concept inventories and validated survey instruments, we found that our modified CREATE intervention promotes higher affective and cognitive gains in students in contrast to three comparison groups. We also found that students tended to underpredict their learning and performance in the modified CREATE intervention, while students in some comparison groups had the opposite trend. Together, our results contribute to the expanding literature on how and why different implementations of the same active-learning strategy contribute to student outcomes.

TI Fiber Force: A Fiber Diet Intervention in an Advanced Course-Based
   Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) Course
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MICROBIOLOGY; STUDENTS; THINKING; SCIENCE; PROJECT
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are an effective way to introduce students to contemporary scientific research. Research experiences have been shown to promote critical thinking, improve understanding and proper use of the scientific method, and help students learn practical skills including writing and oral communication. We aimed to improve scientific training by engaging students enrolled in an upper division elective course in a human microbiome CURE. The "Fiber Force" course is aimed at studying the effect of a wholesome high-fiber diet (40 to 50 g/day for two weeks) on the students' gut microbiomes. Enrolled students participated in a noninvasive diet intervention, designed health surveys, tested hypotheses on the effect of a diet intervention on the gut microbiome, and analyzed their own samples (as anonymized aggregates). The course involved learning laboratory techniques (e.g., DNA extraction, PCR, and 16S sequencing) and the incorporation of computational techniques to analyze microbiome data with QIIME2 and within the R software environment. In addition, the learning objectives focused on effective student performance in writing, data analysis, and oral communication. Enrolled students showed high performance grades on writing, data analysis and oral communication assignments. Pre- and post-course surveys indicate that the students found the experience favorable, increased their interest in science, and heightened awareness of their diet habits. Fiber Force constitutes a validated case of a research experience on microbiology with the capacity to improve research training and promote healthy dietary habits.

DT Editorial Material
AB Helping undergraduate students engage with primary literature and understand the process of science are high-priority skills in most life science courses. Collaborative learning activities that enhance these skills will continue to be in high demand by instructors at all levels. Here we present a "Research Box" learning activity that helps students engage with primary research articles in a guided and collaborative fashion. Students summarize key components of an empirical study in a one-page figure. An assessment rubric is also included that can be easily modified by instructors to meet their specific needs. Assessment data from two institutions reveal that students value this activity and report that it increases their confidence at understanding primary research articles and experimental results. The Research Box activity is easy to implement, can be completed in a single class period, and provides instructors with a well-defined way to assess student comprehension of experimental design and data interpretation.

TI Drawing a Link Between Genetic Inheritance and Meiosis: A Set of
   Exercises for the Undergraduate Biology Classroom
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Alleles are passed from parent to offspring through meiotic cell division and subsequent fusion of gametes. Despite this important link, general biology courses at the high school and college levels frequently discuss meiosis and genetic inheritance as two distinct content areas. As a consequence, students may leave biology courses with a working knowledge of both meiosis and genetic inheritance in isolation rather than understanding them as interconnected topics. In this paper, we describe and provide a series of classroom exercises that prompt students to explore the connection between meiosis and genetic inheritance. Specifically, students draw cells containing chromosomes with labeled alleles to illustrate key steps in the formation of gametes during meiosis and the subsequent fusion of gametes during fertilization. We believe that this approach is appropriate for either group or individual work, during or outside of class time, and we describe potential benefits for students and instructors.

TI Intercultural Competency: Steps for Introducing Active Learning Case
   Studies Internationally in Confucian Heritage Culture
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION REFORM; PEDAGOGY; STUDENTS
AB Educational interculturalism continues to expand for our increasingly diverse classrooms, both at home and globally. When visiting faculty share active-learning, case study-based learning activities internationally with host faculty in Asian settings, instruction must take into consideration culturally-appropriate pedagogy in the context of Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC). The challenge for visiting faculty lies in not being completely versed in host culture yet remaining open to discovering how educational practices might be adapted within a CHC context. Additional care must be taken by visiting faculty at this first level of host faculty training to engage in active learning interculturally. This Perspectives article attempts to highlight intercultural competency steps, strategies, and examples provided as supplementary material, that are useful for the creation and implementation of an active-learning case study for CHC faculty development: I) cultural preparation, 2) immersed engagement in the host country and reflection on self-cultural competency, 3) development of a culturally relevant case study addressing a host country need, 4) a contextual problem to incite interest, 5) learning outcomes, 6) making the case a real, personalized, narrative and 7) relevant faculty development questions to find the best fit in their culture. During implementation of the case study, 8) the visiting instructor models active learning, acting as a guide to international host faculty, who experientially learn about active learning while engaging in solving the case study themselves. Additional strategies include the presenter leaving the room to provide space for collaborative learning to occur where CHC cultural barriers prevent full engagement. Finally, in step 9) resources are provided.

AB Logistical challenges in large enrollment classes are often mentioned as obstacles to active learning. Writing is an integral part of being a scientist and is often one of the first tools considered by STEM instructors to increase student engagement, but iterative writing assignments in large classes require creativity on the part of the instructor. We found an association between writing-to-learn assignments designed to be consistent with inclusive learning pedagogies and student performance measures in a large enrollment undergraduate biology course. They provide ample opportunity for deliberate practice and inclusive engagement, components of the "heads and hearts" hypothesis posed to explain the variation in active learning impacts on the performance of minoritized students.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The pivot to remote and hybrid learning during the Covid-19 pandemic presented a challenge for many in academia. Most institutions were not prepared to support this rapid change, and instructors were left with the burden of converting a traditional face-to-face course into multiple modalities with very limited preparation time. When institutional support is lacking, we posit that instructor communities of practice can help provide the resources needed to meet the instructional demands. Tiny Earth, a course-based-undergraduate research experience (CURE) and international network of instructors and students, responded to the instructional challenges of the pandemic by leveraging its large community of instructors to create several smaller working groups to form focused communities of practice. Using the pedagogical principles of backward design and scientific teaching, one working group, the Tiny Earth Pivot Group (Pivot Group) generated a course map of remote learning activities and simulated learning resources to fulfill the Tiny Earth learning objectives and maintain the essential tenets of a CURE. Additional working groups were created to disseminate the resources collated and created by the Pivot Group to the greater community. In terms of Tiny Earth, the community structure provided the means for instructors to rapidly pivot their course materials to multiple modalities while upholding the student CURE experience. Harnessing the hallmarks of communities of practice-collective workpower toward common purpose, diversity of perspectives, and ongoing evolution-coupled with high-structured course design allows instructors flexibility and adaptability in meeting the changing modalities of higher education.

AB As educators, we should not assume that students are progressing toward intended STEM careers simply because they have persisted and received a STEM degree. In addition to learning biology content and scientific skills, students need guidance in making optimal career choices. In this study, we present seven career development modules designed specifically to motivate students to consider their successes as scientists and to consider applying their biological knowledge and scientific skills to a range of biology careers. These modules highlight the value and the utility of a biology degree and are, therefore, designed to increase students' self-confidence as well as their science and biology identities. The career development modules presented here are easy to implement and, in our experience, encourage engagement and class discussions. Our analyses confirm that these modules collectively increase student science and biology identities, two predictors for entry into STEM careers.

ID RISK
AB The integration of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) laboratory curricula has provided new avenues to engage students at all levels in discovery-based learning. Empirical research demonstrates that CUREs have the potential to foster students' development of scientific process and reasoning skills, attitudes, motivations, and persistence in STEM. Yet, these outcomes are largely reported for studies conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. It therefore remains unclear to what extent CUREs are impactful for students enrolled in alternate international university contexts. To address this concern, we conducted a quasi-experimental mixed methods study to investigate the impact of a one-semester food microbiology and public health (FMPH) CURE on nonmajors students' development of science identity, science communication and process skills, science community values, and science-society perceptions at a private institution in Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa. Content analysis of students' end-of-semester research poster products and thematic analysis of student responses to post-semester open-ended survey items revealed positive gains with respect to student learning and student perceptions of the relevancy of their research to diverse audiences. Paired t-test analyses of pre-/post-semester closed-ended survey responses likewise indicated significant gains in students' science identity and science community values development as well as their confidence in handling and treating foods to reduce the bacterial load on those foods. Collectively, these findings suggest that the FMPH CURE was a meaningful and relevant learning experience capable of promoting students' growth as scientists and scientifically-minded citizens.

ID SCIENCE; IDENTITY; WOMEN
AB For undergraduate students, feeling an affinity with a science community is a key factor related to interest and persistence in science. Thus, how students perceive scientists can affect their sense of belonging. In this study, we interviewed biology majors and nonscience majors at two institutions, including students who were hearing and deaf, to understand their perceptions of scientists. We used a mixed-methods analytic approach, including coding to classify responses and box plots, to evaluate how endorsement of both positive and negative stereotypes and desire for science to afford altruistic, communal opportunities may differ between student populations. Groups studied include women and men students; biology majors and nonscience majors; hearing and deaf students; and introductory and advanced biology majors. Findings indicate that opportunities to see altruistic and communal qualities of science may be important for women, nonscience majors, and deaf students. Interestingly, the majority of students did not assign gender to an imagined scientist. Implications for challenging stereotypes about scientists and making altruistic and communal opportunities in science more visible are discussed.

ID ENGAGEMENT; CLASSROOM
AB In contrast to efforts focusing on improving inclusion in STEM classrooms from kindergarten through undergraduate (K-16), efforts to improve inclusion in scientific meetings and conferences, important hubs of STEM culture, are more recent. Markers of inclusion that are sometimes overlooked at these events can include the composition of panels, how workshops are run, the affordability of conferences, and various other mechanisms that maintain pre-existing hierarchies and norms that limit the participation of early-career researchers and individuals of minoritized cultural, linguistic, and economic backgrounds. The Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) network coordinates efforts of researchers from many fields interested in diversity and inclusion in biology education. Given the concerns regarding inclusion at professional meetings, iEMBER has developed and implemented several practices in planning and executing our meetings to make them more inclusive. In this report, we share our experiences developing inclusive meetings on biology education research and discuss the outcomes of such efforts. Specifically, we present our approach to planning and executing the iEMBER 2019 conference and the National Association of Biology Teachers iEMBER 2019 workshop. This report adds to the growing body of resources on inclusive meetings, provides readers with an account of how such an attempt at implementation might unfold, and complements existing theories and work relating to the importance and functioning of such meetings in terms of representation in STEM.

ID RESEARCH EXPERIENCES; BENEFITS; SCIENCE
AB Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) is an access institution with a diverse student body, located in metro Atlanta. To strengthen research skills, teach employer-valued cell biology laboratory techniques, and increase student engagement, a semester-long, inquiry-based CURE was developed and implemented in Cell Biology with Laboratory (BIOL3400K), a sophomore-level course, which serves as a "gateway" to all upper-level biology courses. This CURE centers on the investigation of a student-chosen experimental factor on the viability of cultured, mammalian cells. Through participation in this CURE, students gain experience in cell culture, fluorescence microscopy, and viability assays, and strengthen important research skills, such as literature searches, graphing, and data analyses. The impact of this CURE on student learning gains and attitudes was assessed using pre-/post-content exams and the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). Our data show that all students made significant content gains. Female students made larger learning gains than male students. Additionally, minority students performed better than majority students in some content areas. Student attitudes did not change, or in some cases were slightly more negative after the CURE. Overall, this CURE had a positive impact on students by engaging them in an inquiry-based laboratory experience.

ID INQUIRY
AB The Emory-Tibet Science Initiative was founded when the Dalai Lama invited Emory to develop and teach a comprehensive curriculum in modern science to Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns. The project was built to grow and nurture a two-way exchange between complementary systems of knowledge. In the 10 years since the first days of the pilot, the interactions between people and places and the scientific and learning processes have served as a platform for exploring teaching across cultures and enriching approaches to teaching and science more generally. As a result of these interactions, we expand our definition of inclusivity in the classroom and the practice of science, emphasize connections and tensions between science and other systems of knowledge, and create space for student and instructor reflection and learning. The next phase of the project will engage students in research projects as tools for learning and as a means to contribute knowledge to the project and the larger science education community.

TI Program-Based Teaching and Learning To Increase Competency in
   Undergraduate Medical Students Using a Model of the Revised National
   Tuberculosis Control Program
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Teaching methods need continuous innovation to encourage undergraduate medical students to enhance their competency level and skills. Every undergraduate medical student should be able to discuss the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) and Direct Observed Treatment Short (DOTS) course recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DOTS strategy was launched in 1992, with the objective of detecting at least 70% of new sputum-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients and curing at least 85% of such patients. The aim of this study was to improve the competency level of Undergraduate (UG) Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students by teaching them the objectives of the RNTCP at a program implementation site in the medical college. The RNTCP could be considered and conducted as Program-Based Teaching and Learning (PBTL) for the UG medical students. The following skills were to be implemented in the RNTCP PBTL: Sputum Collection, Ziehl-Neelsen staining and Grading, Mantoux test, and TB Culture and Molecular test (Gene Xpert). Phase II undergraduate MBBS students (N = 104) participated in the PBTL. This study was conducted in the RNTCP laboratory of a tertiary-care teaching medical college hospital. This descriptive study included advanced skill-based teaching such as Directly Observed Practical Skill, Demonstration-Observation-Assistance-Performance, Video Demonstrations, Role Play, and Group interaction as teaching tools. Pre-/post-test, Objective Structured Practical Examination, and frequently asked questions were used as assessment tools. The pre- and post-test marks were compared, and other assessments were also analyzed using SPSS. At the end of the teaching program, the feedback forms were collected from students and analyzed. The mean score obtained for 104 MBBS students in the pre-test, post-test, and other assessment tools were 213.3 and 487.5, respectively (p < 0.001). We conclude that skill-based teaching and learning tools to teach public health program like RNTCP provide valuable essential skills for undergraduate medical students. This Program Based Teaching and Learning could be successfully extended to all medical colleges.

TI Methods to improve grading reliability in multi-section undergraduate
   courses
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DT Article; Early Access
DE Grading; reliability; undergraduate; biology; large-enrollment
AB Grades matter to students, and grading methods have documented impacts on student outcomes. While many strategies exist to study variance and reliability in research settings, unique challenges exist when it comes to applying these techniques in practical settings of post-secondary coursework. In our course setting, teaching assistants (TA's) grade the written laboratory reports, but there are concerns regarding their grading reliability and accuracy. In this report, we reflect on our effort to improve grading reliability in a multi-section undergraduate biology course with roughly 1,000 students a year, which employs multiple-teaching assistants (TA's) who grade the written laboratory reports. Within this course data, our findings suggest that much of the variation in student scores likely occurred at the teaching assistant (TA) level, and that interventions can be successfully aimed at TA-level variability (rather than those based on lab section, for example). Intraclass correlation may be a useful tool in describing where the variability exists in each unique course setting. A combination of round table grading (e.g. using a rubric or specific guidelines to train those grading lab reports in a group setting) and one-to-one meetings was successful in improving the TAs' formative feedback to students and in decreasing student concerns. It also improved overall efficiency of the grading process. However, the round table grading likely did not improve inter-TA reliability, and some form of mean-differentiated scoring may be necessary when TA's differ significantly in the severity of their grading.

AB Virtual field trips are transforming education in biology and other place-based disciplines - and not just since Covid-19 has imposed social distancing constraints. Efficient methods for content creation, combined with affordable immersive technology, provide the opportunity to integrate immersive experiences into ever-larger classes. However, many aspects of how immersive experiences can enrich and improve learning in place-based education are still not well understood. We present an empirical study, conducted in a large undergraduate ecology class, comparing students, that experienced an immersive virtual version of a field trip to a biological preserve as preparation for a later actual field trip to the site, with a control group that visited the real site but without having had the virtual experience. Within the virtual experience group, we also varied the quality of the headset. The VR field trip was well received for raising spatial awareness and also motivation and interest. Students ranked it higher than any traditional means with regard to achieving a high level of preparedness for the actual field trip. In contrast, no statistically significant evidence was found for differences in perceived learning outcome and enjoyment of the actual field trip.

AB This study aimed to facilitate grade 8 students' conceptual understanding of 'sustainable development (SD)' via Common Knowledge Construction Model (CKCM)-oriented instruction. Through a pre-experimental research approach, the study was conducted with 31 grade 8 students drawn from a secondary school in the city of Trabzon, Turkey. A word association test (WAT), a conceptual understanding test (CUT) and student worksheets were used to unveil their conceptual understanding of SD (i.e. sustainability, recycling, saving, technology, environment, and the technology-environment-sustainability cycle). In analysing data, grade 8 students' responses to the WAT and CUT were imported into SPSS 22.0(TM) to run a paired samples t-test. Further, their responses to each worksheet were exposed to content analysis via three criteria: Positive Relational Development, Negative Relational Development and No Change. The current study revealed that the CKCM-oriented instruction was effective in enhancing grade 8 students' conceptual understanding of SD and challenging their alternative conceptions. In light of the results, the current study recommends that teachers and science educators develop similar teaching designs for other science topics.

TI The notion of 'information' in genetics: a pragmatic model
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Information; genes; communication; metaphor; pragmatics
ID METAPHOR; PHILOSOPHY; SCIENCE
AB In this paper I suggest a pragmatic model for the notion of 'information' used in molecular biology in the description of protein synthesis. Discarding any ontological commitments of the term 'information', I propose a view of information based on an analogy with communication. This view could at least supplement the existing information-metaphor that should be updated for two reasons: (i) the concept of information it presupposes, and (ii) the origin of the metaphor itself. Besides, the metaphorical nature of the notion of 'information' is still often overlooked, which leads to a false sense of understanding of the underlying genetic phenomena it should describe. The advantages of a model based on communication, as it is seen by the field of pragmatics, is twofold: (i) it provides a rather simple analogy between human communication and basic genetic processes, and (ii) it supplies the tools for the understanding of the non-literal use of the term 'information'.

AB Complementing biology lecture courses with laboratory sections is nearly universal at undergraduate institutions, yet many topics in biology do not easily lend themselves to experiment-based laboratory activities. Topics such as comparative anatomy, evolution and systematics are often taught as passive, observation-based laboratories. In this experiment, we modified and tested the efficacy of a team-based learning approach called the 'Jigsaw' method in 14 sections of an undergraduate Vertebrate Biology laboratory course at Iowa State University. Specifically, we implemented the modified Jigsaw method in seven lab sections and taught seven lab sections in the traditional lecture and observation style, comparing mean quiz score between the experimental and control sections after accounting for variation due to instructor and year. We revealed significantly higher average quiz scores for students in the experimental sections as compared to the control sections. Herein, we describe the details of our modified Jigsaw implementation that can be applied to other such biology laboratory courses. Thus, we provide further support for the use of team-based learning approaches such as the Jigsaw method and specifically show that undergraduate biology laboratory courses can be improved by implementing such activities in lieu of a clear experimental approach to laboratory courses.

AB Individual based models (IBMs) are up-to-date tools both in research and educational areas. Here we introduce an IBM built on NetLogo platform that simulates a top-down trophic cascade controlled by the pressure exerted by two model predators (web-building spiders and ground runner spiders) on a model pest (the olive fruit fly) within a hypothetical agricultural landscape (the olive crop). EcoPred is an IBM that aims to be an educational tool that can help teachers to explain concepts related to ecology in a modern, enjoyable and comprehensive way. EcoPred reflects the changes on a fly population within a simulated olive crop according to (1) the mortality rate caused by the predation of two spider species and energy loss, (2) the energy gain by feeding on flowers and (3) the reproduction rate in olive trees. The model was tested with 26 students achieving very good results in terms of acceptance and interest on the learning method. EcoPred can be used for educational purposes with 16 year old students and older to explain ecological concepts such as trophic level, species interactions, limiting factor and biological control in an interactive way simultaneously introducing students to biology oriented programming languages.

AB Although very rare, the existing research on the biological education of blind people indicates that teaching content is not fully in line with the sensory perception of that content by the blind. The aim of this study is to analyse the morphological details which the blind can register in multisensory plant research and to harmonise the sequencing of these descriptions by the blind with the sequencing of the morphological descriptions used in the botanical education of partially sighted people in Montenegro and Austria. The research uses a descriptive-analytical and comparative method. The research technique is observation. The study included 100 blind people from Montenegro and Austria, with an average age of 25. It is necessary to harmonise the sequence of general description and the description of each vegetative plant organ in the previous botanical education of the blind, as well as to implement new descriptions of those morphological characteristic that are perceived by the blind, which are absent in the current botanical education of the blind. The proposed changes would contribute to the improvement of the botanical education of the blind.

AB Human cognition is influenced by natural selection which results in better information retention related to survival and faster visual recognition of potential threat. Plants are excellent models for studying human preferences because of the long evolutionary connectedness of humans with plants as food sources, although research in this field is scarce. We created visual detection tasks to investigate human responses to toxic and non-toxic plants using a sample of children (N = 80) and adolescents (N = 80). As predicted, toxic plants were detected significantly sooner than non-toxic plants. Children showed faster plant detection times than adolescents and females were faster in identification of plants than males. There were, however, no differences in toxic plant identification skills with respect to age and gender. These results suggest that plant toxicity, as an example of survival-relevant information, meets with increased attention on the part of humans and needs to be incorporated into teaching botany.

AB Medical education is moving towards more interactive teaching methods. During Year 1 at Manchester Medical School (MMS), students study the heart in preparation for the hospital-based years of study. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of mortality worldwide and thus, the content studied in Year 1 is essential for practising clinicians. This study produced an e-learning resource (ELR) and a classroom-based lesson (CBL), which both aimed to increase students' understanding of CVD by using 'patient'-centred activities. Confidence surveys pre- and post-resource were used to assess their efficacy, while questionnaires and verbal feedback assessed the resources' enjoyability. It was hypothesised the resources would increase participants' confidence in their understanding of CVD. As hypothesised, Year 1 students' confidence significantly increased after both resources (Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, n = 22 for ELR and n = 13 for CBL, P < 0.05), and feedback suggested students found the resources enjoyable and engaging. Students reported greater confidence increases in their pharmacology knowledge and communication skills after the CBL vs ELR, whilst confidence in their anatomy and physiology knowledge had greater increases after the ELR. These findings support studies that suggest interactive learning is effective and suggest different teaching methods could be used to provide a well-rounded education.

ID EMBRYOS; ORIGIN
AB Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) is most recalled in the history of biology for his Recapitulation Theory and the allegedly fudged illustrations of embryos that he presented in support of that case. Less well known is his contribution to abiogenesis theory, which he incorporated into evolutionary theory. In so doing, Haeckel, a vitriolic atheist, was instrumental in inserting atheism into the evolutionary mindset. While anti-evolution propaganda commonly makes Darwin out to be the villain of the piece, the association of evolution in the broad sense of the word with atheism arises more from the Haeckelian legacy than from Darwin's initially conciliatory deism or Huxley's non-committal agnosticism.

ID ANNOTATION
AB The evolution of resistance to antibiotics provides a timely and relevant topic for teaching undergraduate students evolutionary biology. Here, we present a module incorporating modified sequencing data from eight antibiotic resistant pathogen outbreaks in hospital settings with bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses. This module uses whole genome sequencing data from hospital outbreaks investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide examples of antibiotic resistance spread. Students work in groups to analyze outbreak data to identify the bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes, to infer a phylogenetic tree examining relatedness among isolates, and to determine a possible source of the outbreak. Students then compile their results in individual reports and provide recommendations for preventing the further spread of antibiotic resistant organisms. In addition to providing genomic outbreak data, we include a teaching concepts guide discussing three integral components of the module: how evolutionary biology concepts of natural selection and competition impact antibiotic resistance; outbreak investigation information to aid in phylogenetic analysis and creation of recommendations; and instructions for the bioinformatics protocol. Completion of this module provides students an opportunity to think critically about the evolution of resistance, practice bioinformatics techniques, and relate evolutionary biology to current events.

AB Socio-scientific issues (SSI) have proven to be suitable contexts for students to actively reflect on and argue about complex social issues related to science. Research has indicated that explicitly teaching SSI argumentation is a good way to help students develop their argumentation skills and make them aware of the complexity of SSI. However, assessing the quality of students' arguments on SSI is evidently difficult for many teachers. This article aims to facilitate teachers' assessment of the quality of students' arguments on SSI by introducing a new assessment framework that represents a low degree of complexity and exemplifying it by applying it to students' written SSI argumentation concerning genetically modified organisms (GMO). The new assessment framework considers both the quality indicators presented in the research literature and curricular guidelines for the science courses in Swedish secondary and upper secondary school. The framework focuses on both the content and the structure that can be revealed in students' SSI argumentation and is meant to function as a tool for identifying quality indicators that could serve as the basis for grading.

AB The purpose of the study is to find out what a group of seven-year-old South African children understand of their internal anatomy. The research is based on the premise that young children obtain most of their science knowledge through personal experience. Drawings are used to determine the level of young children's knowledge of systems and organs. The study also investigates whether there are significant differences between boys and girls' understanding as well as between children from a range of schooling contexts. Teachers were instructed to ask children to draw what they think is inside their bodies, using the language that is most familiar to the children (English, isiZulu, or isiXhosa). The findings show that children are able to draw individual organs, but are unable to show relationships between them. There were significant differences between different schools, but these differences were not due to different contexts. At Grade 1 level, boys were better able to represent what they thought was inside their bodies than girls. The findings show that the informal knowledge children hold of what is inside their bodies appears to be acquired by informal means, outside the school.

AB Promoting student understanding of ecosystem processes is critical to biological education. Yet, teaching complex life systems can be difficult because systems are dynamic and often behave in a non-linear manner. In this paper, we discuss assessment results from a middle school classroom intervention in which a conceptual representation framework is embedded in a suite of technology tools. We use both hand-drawn models and open-ended written responses to evaluate student understanding. While we speculated that our intervention would help students use ecosystem mechanisms to describe broader processes, we found instead that students tended to express constructs in isolation (as opposed to a unified picture of ecosystem processes). In addition, students provided greater elaboration of ideas mostly when specifically prompted. Specific prompts also tended to produce more accurate representations of the ecosystem processes our curriculum covered. Our findings have allowed us to refine our intervention to better translate these critical concepts, and how they are interrelated, to young learners. As such, these findings have important implications for encouraging broader ecosystem thinking in K-12 classrooms.

AB Students tend to learn genetics by rote and may not realise the interrelationships in daily life. Because reasoning abilities are necessary to construct relationships between concepts and rote learning impedes the students' sound understanding, it was predicted that having high level of formal reasoning and adopting meaningful learning orientation would improve students' understanding of genetics concepts. To test this hypothesis, relationships among students' understanding of genetics concepts, reasoning ability and learning approaches were investigated. A total of 586 eleventh-grade students participated in the study. Students' reasoning ability and learning orientation were measured using the Test of Logical Thinking and the Learning Approach Questionnaire, respectively. Students' understanding of fundamental genetics concepts was assessed using the Two-tier Genetics Concepts Test. Regression analyses were conducted to examine predictive influence of reasoning ability and learning orientations on students' understanding of genetics concepts. The results revealed that all cognitive variables investigated accounted for a statistically significant portion (27%) of the variance in students' understanding of genetics concepts. Reasoning ability and meaningful learning orientation predicted students' understanding of genetics concepts in a positive direction, rote learning orientation predicted it in a negative direction. Additionally, the results indicated that reasoning ability explained more of the variance in test scores as compared to learning approaches.

   a comparative intervention study

ID INVERTEBRATES; KNOWLEDGE; LESSONS; BIOLOGY
AB Primarerfahrung (PE) describes direct contact with learning objects; in biological education with plants or animals in particular. Visualising these objects using videos, books, etc, can be classified as Sekundarerfahrung (SE) because the information is not presented in the 'original' way. In this intervention study, a teaching unit was conducted with living invertebrates (PE treatment, n = 35) and educational videos of these animals displayed on laptops (SE treatment, n = 29) to ensure identical instructional settings in group work. Affective dimensions (interests, attitudes, learning climate) and cognitive dimensions (declarative and conceptual knowledge) were recorded with validated items in pre-, post- and follow-up tests. Compared with the SE treatment, the PE treatment achieved knowledge at a significantly higher level (d = 0.30) and showed more significant changes in almost all attitude dimensions. The results are discussed with consideration to general implications for biological education.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of explicit-embedded-reflective (EER) instruction in nature of science (NOS) understandings of ninth-grade advanced science students. This study was conducted with 71 students, who were divided into three groups, by using non-equivalent quasi-experimental design. In the treatment groups, the EER teaching was conducted, while in the comparison group NOS instruction was carried out in the same time interval by lecturing, demonstration and questioning strategies. Views on Nature of Science Questionnaire-Form C and follow-up interviews were used for data collection. Categorisation of the participants' profiles on aspects of the NOS was used for data analysis. According to the results, participants had misunderstandings about scientific methods', laws and theories' and observation and inference', while they had expert views on the role of creativity and imagination' in the beginning of the study. For changing naive NOS understandings, the EER approach was found to be effective.

ID SCIENCE
AB Acquisition of scientific reasoning is one of the big challenges in education. A popular educational strategy advocated for acquiring deep knowledge is inquiry-based learning, which is driven by emerging good questions'. This study will address the question: Which design features allow learners to refine questions while preserving student ownership of the inquiry process?' This design-based research has been conducted over several years with advanced high-school biology classes. The results confirm the central role of question elaboration as an interactive process that leads from vague to complex and adequate. To make this happen, the inquiry process must extend over a long time, learners and teachers should share a knowledge improvement goal, and text produced by students should be structured by question-answer pairs addressing a single concept using authentic resources. Further features are discussion with peers, teacher feedback with respect to answer elaboration and conceptual differentiation, and finally, teacher guidance that should fade out in successive inquiry cycles to ensure student responsibility.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

ID ENGLAND; ECOLOGY; SCHOOLS; IMPACT
AB Field work and field courses within undergraduate biology degrees have been under threat in recent years for multiple reasons and while there has been widespread support from learned societies, academic staff and students for the retention of field study, there has been little research to support the perceived value of field teaching within this context. This paper reports on research that addresses this issue. Undergraduate attainment data from final-year biology undergraduates were compared with similar attainment data from their penultimate year of study. Those students who attended a 10-day residential field course in Portugal between their penultimate and final years of study were found to perform about a grade better on a 20-point scale compared with non-attending students in their final-year honours module. This research provides quantitative evidence that field courses can increase attainment and improve cognitive learning in undergraduate biology students.

DE social language; epistemological and conceptual aspects; biological

ID CONCEPTIONS; EVERYDAY; SENSE
AB In this paper we explore the idea that learning science involves appropriation of the school-science language and how it manifests in the classroom. This is done through an analysis of peer group discussions in Swedish secondary schools; discussions that served both as an arena for learning and as a research tool. In this arena, the students are offered opportunities of communicating, evaluating and arguing knowledge claims. The analysis focuses on the intersection between social languages (colloquial and scientific), and epistemological/conceptual aspects of biological evolution. We explore how words (especially Vygotsky's meaning and sense of words) and semantic patterns manifest in the students' talk. Specifications are made step by step in negotiations, and the groups of students talk more and more in line with school-science language. We understand this to rely on the establishment of an arena where technical terms and scientific models may be introduced, negotiated, and made sense of, in particular in relation to personal and everyday experiences. The students use an inter-language where colloquial expressions serve as an asset in sense-making.

AB The microbial growth curve is widely studied within microbiology classes and bacteria are usually the microbial model used. Here, we describe a novel laboratory protocol involving flow cytometry to assess the growth dynamics of the unicellular microalgae Isochrysis galbana. The algal model represents an appropriate alternative to bacteria because its slower growth rate allows a better visualization of the growth phases, which makes the logistic of the laboratory sessions easier Flow cytometry is a technique commonly used for cell enumeration in ecology microbiology and medical sciences because of its accuracy and speed. In this experiment, microbial growth was observed under two light conditions and cell abundance was monitored using a flow cytometer and a haemocytometer The chlorophyll a fluorescence of each cell was also measured by the flow cytometer and was used as an index of cellular content of photosynthetic pigments. Students were asked to compare the results obtained with the two techniques and to explain the effect of light conditions on the growth curve shape and dynamics.

AB This study aims to understand middle and high school students' ecosystem knowledge including knowledge about the food web, food pyramid, and energy flow. The data were collected from 250 middle school and high school students. Students' drawings were used to collect data and coded as correct, wrong, or no answer. Then, students' wrong answers were re-analysed to reveal common problems students had in the ecosystem topic. Findings showed that participants were mainly unsuccessful in their drawings. Only 2% of them could correctly draw food webs, and 10% of the participants could draw food pyramids correctly. Among 250 students, only one student could successfully draw energy flow. Moreover, various problems were identified in students' drawings. For example, 94% of middle school students could not show fungi as decomposers in their food web drawing. Similarly, more than half of all students (67%) placed living organisms in the wrong trophic level when they drew a food pyramid. Likewise, only five high school students used the sun as the starting point of energy flow. Considering the findings, students' ecosystem knowledge is discussed and implications are presented.

AB Many studies worldwide have shown that students and pre-service teachers have misconceptions about cell biology concepts. In most cases, teachers are the source of their students' misconceptions. In this regard, we conducted this study to investigate if Moroccan pre-service teachers of life and earth sciences have a good understanding of cell biology concepts, and to find which concepts they misconceive. We developed and validated a three-tier diagnostic test with 20 items concerning cell biology concepts. The test was based on knowledge related to cell biology included in the Moroccan secondary school life and earth sciences' curriculum, which the pre-service teachers will teach. The use of a three-tier test allowed us to differentiate incorrect answers due to misconceptions from those related to a lack of knowledge and correct answers related to strong knowledge, from lucky guess. This study shows that pre-service teachers share several cell biology misconceptions, and that they misconceive the following concepts: cell, gene, hormone, nerve impulse and immune response. Misconceptions detected may impede pre-service teachers' learning and may be transmitted to their students, which requires development of a training strategy to overcome these obstacles.

AB There is widespread misuse of statistics in research, particularly in the life sciences, which is one of the contributing factors to reproducibility concerns in research. However, the formal quantitative training that life sciences research trainees receive is often quite limited. Our survey of statistics requirements in undergraduate life sciences programmes offered by the top research-intensive universities in Canada, the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities, confirmed that training in statistics tends to be limited and more general in nature. To help raise awareness and address these limitations, this paper shares findings of this statistics requirements survey and describes the evidence-based framework for a second-year undergraduate course at the University of Toronto, which was introduced to integrate statistics instruction with the life sciences research process. We hope these insights will inform future quantitative course offerings, and ultimately, better prepare students to effectively engage with statistics in life sciences research.

AB We investigated what students learnt about biodiversity, a broad and multi-dimensional concept, challenging to understand, following a visit to a nature reserve. Acknowledging the individual nature of informal learning, we explore Personal Meaning Maps (PMMs) coupled with semi-structured interviews to investigate learning among 13 scouts aged 13-15 years as they participated in a single guided tour to a nature reserve in Mauritius. PMMs were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Adopting a constructivist approach, biodiversity learning was framed along three lenses, namely, 'ecological literacy', 'biodiversity and society' and 'nature and self', recognising that biodiversity is a socio-scientific concept. Following the visit, there was an increase in ecological literacy through an understanding of the importance of biodiversity, conservation measures and endemic species. Participants retained a species-centred view of biodiversity. Students could better critique biodiversity and society issues and displayed a higher appreciation for nature and the intrinsic value of biodiversity. The visit contributed to an enrichment in biodiversity-related vocabulary especially regarding local endemic and extinct species. Prior knowledge determined vocabulary enrichment but not conceptual additions among individual students. We suggest a wider explo ration of PMMs to investigate prior knowledge and subsequent learning during nature reserve visits which can powerfully enhance biodiversity education.

AB The increase in student diversity, legislative changes and shift towards the social model of disability has led to greater emphasis on inclusive curricula within Higher Education (HE). Whilst there are good examples for changes in assessment, delivery and student support, specific challenges faced by Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics students in relation to laboratory teaching are less well understood. A questionnaire approach was used to determine barriers that students face within laboratory teaching. Questionnaire invitations were distributed by email to undergraduate students at institutions within the United Kingdom with a total of 232 responses. Results indicated a lower sense of belonging for female students and those with a disability. Differences between ethnic groups could not be identified due to low numbers of Black Asian, Minority Ethnic students, which highlights broader issues of participation in STEM subjects. Prior experience of students in relation to the number of labs, rather than subject, was also important, emphasising the critical link between school and HE. Communication of information was critical for learning with students often requiring multiple methods; timing and structure of this were important. A more inclusive lab environment can be developed through the use of online support, better structuring of labs and changes to assessment.

AB Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is a versatile and widely used technique to detect and quantify small molecules in various clinical and analytical applications. It is also an effective tool for demonstrating the specificity between antibody and antigen to students across diverse disciplines. However, undergraduate laboratories often face the difficulty of performing proper ELISA exercise due to time and facility constraints. Here, we report a cost-effective, technically simple ELISA exercise which can be completed within 2.5-h at room temperature. This microtitre plate-based ELISA exercise utilises easily sourced inexpensive materials and simulated serum samples which are safe to handle in the undergraduate lab settings. The hands-on procedure and a real-life scenario of disease (Rheumatoid Arthritis) diagnosis reinforce students' understanding of antigen-antibody interactions. ELISA results are displayed by a colourimetric enzymatic reaction, which can be analysed by eye without specialised equipment. This laboratory exercise was designed as part of the final year's immunology course in a three-year undergraduate Biomedical Science programme, but can also be adapted to suit a broad range of student skill levels in science-fields because of its easy set-up and low technical requirement. The procedure and scenario can be also adjusted to meet the specific needs of other educator's goals.

AB This small-scale study investigates the relationship between gender ideology and co-ed secondary school boys' intention to participate in biology post-GCSE. Adopting a mixed-methods approach, questionnaires (n = 96) and interviews (n = 13) were carried out to collect data on the intention to participate in school science subjects, gendered perceptions of these subjects, and gender ideology from Y10 students from three Greater London co-educational (co-ed) secondary schools. The results from this study show that, contrary to numerous other studies, boys perceive biology as a gender-neutral subject, hinting at the possible shifting perceptions of school subjects with time. This could be a result of more perceived gender appropriate opportunities for boys, or the masculinisation of biology as a subject with the introduction of more technology-based topics within the curriculum. In spite of this, the perception of physics and physics-related jobs as masculine and more suitable for boys is so deeply rooted and normalised that it may deter boys from pursuing biology post-GCSE. Lastly, even though this study shows that gender ideology does not affect boys' intention to participate in biology post-GCSE, there is some evidence that gender ideology could still be a factor with subjects perceived to be gendered, like physics. Based on these findings, three recommendations are made to increase gender equity in school science education.

AB A complex terminology developed around the evolutionary concept of adaptation. One definition of adaptation is synonymous with adaptive evolution and denotes a process of population change driven by natural selection resulting in individuals better able to survive and reproduce in a particular environment (compared to the population before the process began). This places adaptation at a hypothetical end point in a temporal sequence and can be difficult to use because the phenotypic composition of earlier, non-adapted populations is unknown. However, resurrection experiments can provide comparative data on populations before and after adaptation. The process of adaptation is a corollary to the well-described precepts of natural selection found in textbooks. Adaptation also denotes any trait that increases an organism's fitness relative to individuals lacking it. This 'all or none' concept of adaptation limits its usefulness because most traits are quantitative. Leaf pubescence, a quantitative trait showing phenotypic and genetic variation in plant species, is used to illustrate adaptive value and significance. Historical application of adaptation has ranged from individuals to populations to species and encompassed molecular and phenotypic traits. Although exaptation and maladaptation have some heuristic utility, 'pre-adaptation' is best avoided because it does not reflect adaptive evolution.

AB This research project sought to determine how the application of a system thinking learning approach (STLA) affects student perceptions of the fundamental biological principle of homoeostasis. This quasi-experimental study applied a two-group design and included 146 10(th) grade students attending heterogeneous public schools (ages 15-16). The quantitative results testify to the contribution of an STLA towards improving the perception of homoeostasis among the studied group. Qualitative analysis revealed that the characteristics of homoeostasis primarily promoted by an STLA were efficiency, dynamics of a homoeostatic process, and environments. The characteristics of coordination and lack of randomness, control regulation and feedback mechanisms, and multisystems, have been partially promoted, and the energy characteristic was found to be the hardest nut to crack. An STLA has the potential to help teachers meet their challenge to facilitate student understanding of the fundamental principle of homoeostasis.

AB The lack of interest among pre-university students to choose STEM subjects for their higher education is a heavily debated issue in many western-world countries. To boost Danish students? interest in biology, a study event on artificial reefs was introduced when teaching marine biology in lower secondary school and upper secondary school (student age 13?20 years). The purpose was to investigate if the focus on artificial reefs could generate an increased interest in natural science and marine biology among the students. The students? interest in science was evaluated using electronic questionnaires before and after they had completed the teaching programme. The students were significantly more interested in natural sciences and marine biology after than before the teaching program. The development in situational interest in science and in the oceans was different for males and females with females being most interested. Thus, it is possible to trigger a situational interest for science and marine biology by teaching about artificial reefs, but the way interest is triggered differs between different age groups and sexes.

AB The cell is a key concept, and accurate knowledge of it is essential for understanding many phenomena and biological processes, as well as the overall functioning of living beings. However, learning about this concept is not simple. Regarding this concept, we examined the views concerning problems that could be encountered by Master's students training to become future teachers of natural science, compared to the difficulties suffered by a group of students in their last two years of high school. The results show the students' learning about the cell appeared to be negatively influenced by the methodology used in classroom, being this type of difficulties the most reported by the high-school students, followed by difficulties with matters associated with the functional role of the cell. However, the methodology limitations have been the least considered by future teachers. By contrast, they consider the structural aspects of the cell as more likely to be problematic for students, followed by the functional ones. Problems concerning sizes and scales arose similarly in both cases, implying a widespread problem.

AB This study investigates the impact of the Case-Based Learning (CBL) method for the topic of 'B6, B9 and B12 Vitamins' on students' academic achievement in a biochemistry course for an associate degree level in health. To this end, a case study with the title 'The Reasons for Depression: Do We Know What They Are?' was developed and implemented. The study had a one-group pre-test and post-test research design. The 'Vitamins' Achievement Test' (VAT) and a Structured Interview Form were used as data collection tools. First-year students of Medical Laboratory Techniques at the Ahmet Erdogan Vocational School of Health Services at Bulent Ecevit University (N = 34) who were aged between18 and 20 made up the study group. The VAT and the Structured Interview Form were analysed using content analysis and the paired-samples t-test was used for the VAT. The results indicated that the frequency of students' responses in the 'clear understanding' category improved in the VAT post-test and it was concluded that there was a significant positive difference in the post-test scores of students. The results of the structured interview indicated that most of the students had positive opinions about the method, material and case study.

DT Article
DE Vaccination; digital; educational; resource; infectious
ID OUTBREAKS; MEASLES; MUMPS
AB Vaccination coverage in the United Kingdom is below the level recommended by the World Health Organisation, and when vaccination coverage is not sufficient, outbreaks of infectious diseases can occur. In 2015, coverage of the first dose of the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine declined in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2008, indicating a need to raise public awareness and understanding of the importance of vaccination to public health. Identifying 16 - 18-year olds as a target audience, being future parents who would make decisions regarding vaccination of their children, a digital educational resource ('SimFection') was developed to deliver key messages about the spread and control of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases (identified via school curricula). The process of development utilised an iterative approach, involving a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analysis and refinement with a range of audiences including students, schoolchildren, and trainee teachers. The completed resource is now available online for free download.

AB The present work aimed to investigate the contribution of the board game 'Synthesizing Proteins' to the understanding of protein synthesis by high school students, based on the socio-interactionist theory of Vygotsky. Fifteen students (six from a public school and nine from a private school) participated in the research, which had three stages: diagnosis and pre-interview, game execution, and post-interview, with collection of written and audiovisual data. The data were organised and interpreted according to a qualitative content analysis, in which we evaluated the predominant concepts, the conceptual gains and type of interactions promoted by the game in the understanding of target themes. The results indicated that the game contributed to the improvement (or construction) of a protein synthesis model by the students, providing a symbolic representation of the process through interactions guided by the rules of the game (in the game, students played the roles of molecules, and simulated mechanisms and processes). These interactions, especially of cooperative and competitive nature, may promote a meaningful, prospective learning.

AB We have designed and tested an exercise to detect misconceptions among students about meiosis, a fundamental concept in genetics. A total of 30 students responded to a questionnaire, all of whom were in the fifth semester of the Biology bachelor's degree program offered by the Faculty of Science of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Our analysis showed that students have a poor understanding of the fundamental processes of meiosis and that they have trouble distinguishing them. When asked to diagram part of the process, none were able to produce a complete and accurate representation.

ID SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; BALANCING SELECTION;
   POLYMORPHISM
AB Teaching biological evolution can be difficult on a number of levels, be it student confusion arising from prior conceptions and the controversy surrounding evolution, or simply because the material is complex. Games and simulations can help to convey complex topics and also to increase variety in teaching methods. Here I describe a card game that can be used to teach the advanced topic of protected polymorphism in higher education settings. Protected polymorphism is allelic variation resulting from negative frequency-dependent selection; when the fitness of an allele increases when it becomes rare, the allele will be protected' from extinction. Negative frequency-dependent selection is proposed to maintain genetic variation in nature, which is required for evolution by natural selection. Protected polymorphisms primarily play a role in biological interactions, such as immune systems, plant-pathogen interactions, sexual selection and predator-prey interactions. The card game described here uses plant pollination alleles as an example. The game is played using eleven stocks of traditional playing cards per group of about six students. Specific topics addressed include negative frequency-dependent selection, polyploidy, dominance, selfing and inbreeding depression.

AB We present quantitative results for the doctoral thesis of the first-named author of this article. The objective was to recommend and test a teaching proposal for core knowledge of evolutionary biology in secondary education. The focus of the study is 'Problem cores in teaching'. The 'Weaving evolutionary thinking' teaching unit, designed for and tested in this study, entailed: selecting basic evolutionary knowledge from the model of evolution through variation and natural selection; designing a coordinated set of activities, teaching resources and evaluation tools; leading a process of teacher training; and building bridges between: the teaching model, research into the teaching of evolutionary biology, our own teaching experience and that of the secondary school teacher who participated in the project. The data collected through questionnaires show significant differences in favour of the experimental group, which means that the proposal may be favourably assessed in the context of Mexican education, in terms of feasibility, relevance and the pedagogical transformation of knowledge.

AB Team-based learning (TBL) is an innovative form of collaborative learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate TBL's effect on the performance and satisfaction of grade 7 students in biology in a private school in Lebanon, as well as teachers' willingness to implement this new methodology. An exploratory study was performed whereby two biology units were taught to two groups of students using either TBL (60 students) or traditional lecture-based instruction (30 students). Later, a summative test was administered to evaluate students' performance. Students' attitudes were evaluated using a questionnaire and teachers' classroom observations. Finally, science teachers' willingness to try TBL in their classes was assessed using a questionnaire (14 teachers). Results showed that underachievers taught according to TBL did better than underachievers taught with the lecture-based approach. The majority of students enjoyed TBL and found it useful and fun. Finally, science teachers agreed that TBL is a good alternative to the traditional lecture-based method.

AB First year undergraduate courses in higher education tend to be designed based on assumptions of students' prior knowledge. Almost 600 undergraduates at five UK universities, studying biological sciences, were given an MCQ test in their first week at university, based on biology A-level (pre-university examination) core criteria. Results demonstrated low-level retention of basic concepts. There was variation between subject area and examination board and an inverse correlation between MCQ score and time since taking A-levels. By discovering what students remember from their pre-university learning, undergraduate courses can be designed to be more student-focused and so develop a deeper-learning teaching strategy. The results also suggest that, if A-levels are to be redesigned to enhance their impact for students entering higher education, creating programmes which encourage retention of key concepts should be a key factor to consider.

DE Chilling; Drosophila; Ice pack; Flies transferring; Larvae sexing
AB Chilling is a cost-effective and safe method of immobilising flies in Drosophila experiments. However, should condensation form on the plate, it would be fatal to the flies. Here we describe a modified cooling method using reusable commercial ice pack(s) (ca. 400ml, 2-3cm tall) rather than crushed ice. The ice pack is covered with a piece of filter paper which absorbs the condensed water formed on the cold surface, and the moistened filter paper does not wet the wings of flies inverted onto it. An ice pack (ca. 400 ml) takes effect in at least 1 h, and its height is shorter than the maximum specimen height of a dissecting microscope, so that flies can be checked while they remain on the cold surface. This method overcomes the disadvantages of the indigenous cooling anaesthetising approach and makes it practically feasible. We also describe an easy-to-make fly-transferring toolkit which will greatly facilitate fly transferral when it is combined with our chilling method. In our design, the flies were directed out of a vial by a blue pipette tip, which is inserted in a foam stopper and channelled down into another vial by a glass funnel inserted in another foam stopper which is escape-proof.

AB Genomics and proteomics projects have produced a huge amount of raw biological data including DNA and protein sequences. Although these data have been stored in data banks, their evaluation is strictly dependent on bioinformatics tools. These tools have been developed by multidisciplinary experts for fast and robust analysis of biological data. However, there is a gap in the development of educational materials in the bioinformatics area for undergraduate students in bioscience departments. A sample in silico laboratory manual on the prediction of N-glycosylation sites in phosphoethanolamine transferases is presented in this study. The method proposed in this study is simple to apply in laboratory courses and is dependent on the use of internet-based bioinformatics tools such as ProtParam, ClustalW2 and NetNGlyc. In conclusion, this application can stimulate the interest of undergraduate students in bioscience departments and may also contribute to the development of bioinformatics.

AB This study reveals and discusses the problems of future elementary teachers after they have completed a practical on germination, including the fact that such practice is conceptually more complex than is usually considered, at least when the aim is to experiment with the determinant factors for germination. In this case there seemed to be some conflict between everyday knowledge and school knowledge. Thus, nearly half of the subjects indicated the need for soil to germinate seeds, an idea probably associated with their personal experience, because in everyday life seeds are placed in the ground. We believe that seed germination must remain a key part of elementary science teaching, but it should be reoriented taking into account its complexity.

AB This paper describes the development of a taught Master's course in biomedical diagnostics using a novel multi-disciplinary approach. This course, the first of its kind in Ireland, covers the science and technology underlying the development of medical diagnostic devices that detect early markers of diseases such as cancer. The ethical impact of these devices on society, the importance of scientific communication, relevant aspects of business entrepreneurial studies and the commercialisation of medical devices are also covered. The course consists of a mixture of theory, intensive laboratory practicals and independent research. The challenges faced in setting up and running the course are described, as well as some of the novel aspects and may provide valuable insight to those involved in the development of high-level Master's courses.

AB Learning logs or reflective journals are frequently used in further and higher education to encourage students' reflection on their learning. Such approaches are rare in school. This study employed a learning log over a five-week period, with a class of 14-15 year old students learning about digestion, respiration and breathing at a Suffolk upper school in the UK. The study aimed to establish (1) how the learning log can prompt reflection on the learning benefits of classroom activities and increase cognitive control of learning strategies, and (2) how greater understanding of learning strategies may affects students' motivation to learn. The learning logs themselves formed one source of data. Student reflections on the learning benefits of classroom activities were also assessed through classroom dialogue and semi-structured interviews. Motivation was assessed at the start and at the end of the teaching sequence, using a questionnaire. The learning log did stimulate student reflection, but did not prompt the level of learning strategy awareness that emerged in the semi-structured interviews. Suggestions are made (1) for modifications to the learning log, and (2) for how the learning log can provide a mechanism for continuous student feedback on teaching and learning activities.

AB Isoenzymes are variant forms of the same enzyme activity that exhibits different tissue distribution. When cells are damaged, intracellular content leaks into the blood stream, making them potential biochemical markers. Undergraduate health sciences students are expected to interpret laboratory findings of serum levels of biochemical markers and understand their relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This study aimed to design an electrophoresis laboratory class that challenges health sciences students to discuss the experimental approach and interpret the results obtained from electrophoresis of Creatine Kinase (CK) isoenzymes separation. Mixtures of dyes were used to simulate the serum composition of CK isoenzymes in different clinical conditions and the resulting bands were quantified by densitometry. Two online questionnaires assessed students' learning progress and acceptance of the activity. Undergraduate students from biomedicine (n=10) and medicine (n=42) programs participated in a 120-minute pilot class at Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil. The post-class test showed a 21.9 % increase in correct answers compared to the pre-class test. In the survey, students positively rated the laboratory class, expressing improved understanding of theoretical concepts, recognizing the importance of basic biochemistry for their future careers and comprehending the electrophoretic evaluation of CK isoenzymes.

   perspective
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

ID SCIENCE; PHENOMENOLOGY; DEWEY,JOHN
AB John Dewey's aesthetics subverts and transcends traditional aesthetics. He applied his empiricism philosophy into the field of aesthetics and re-established the significance of aesthetic experience. Aesthetic experience comes from daily experience; hence it is not fundamentally different from students' biological learning experience. Based on students' life experience, aesthetic education advances to the climax in biology teaching in a compact and continuous way. In this process, the students' emotions combine practice and intellect into an indivisible whole, forming an experience. The way of learning by doing and the support of necessary techniques make the students' inner impulsion interact with the outer resistance, so that an experience is strengthened and concentrated into aesthetic experience. However, there still exists a research blank in aesthetic education in biology from Dewey's perspective. As the early exploration, this case study aims to answer 'Is it possible for students in secondary schools to construct aesthetic experience through biology learning?' Thus, we designed a bio-macro-photography activity as the learning environment, and analysed the characteristics of life-nature, coherence, unity, and interactivity stemmed from the two participants' experience in phenomenological sense, the result of which indicates that students' biological learning experience is aesthetic experience at the same time.

ID CONTEXT; STANDARDS; STUDENTS; PROJECT; CHALLENGES
AB School-based citizen-science can be a powerful means to engage youth in environmental education, yet developing robust science curricula around citizen-science activities is tremendously challenging. Prior research provides limited examples and very little guidance for curriculum designers. To support the designers of school-based citizen-science curricula, this research article presents a participant-observation case study of designer thinking and processes in creating and integrating in-class curriculum with citizen-science fieldwork. Interviews, observations, and documents of designer work aimed at supporting middle school students' learning of climate change were analysed to gain insight into designer thinking, challenges, and resolutions. Findings indicate how designer work evolved through various measures, including appraisal by external advisors, inspiring examples, surveys of teachers' implementations, and written pre-post assessments of student learning throughout the phases of analysis, development, and evaluation of the curriculum. Four key considerations for designing school-based citizen-science curricula emerged from the data: creating the learning environment around the fieldwork; tackling concerns about data quality and utility; making scientist-designed fieldwork engaging to students; and balancing scientific and educational goals. These considerations are discussed in light of relevant literature, and educational implications for design and research are presented.

AB This article presents research designed along one scholar course with first-year pre-schoolers in Spain. A coherent sequence of learning activities, that combined classroom work with working outside the classroom (in the school garden), was designed in order to analyse if the first-year-preschool children were able to apply scientific tools, including the magnifying glass and dichotomous key to observe, compare, classify and identify small animals within their surroundings. The results obtained show that using a magnifying glass, pupils learned to observe in an intentional way to, by means of counting the number of wings and legs and the colour of small animals, compare small animals. The comparison criteria they established based on this observation and comparison, were used to classify and identify other animals by using a dichotomous key. The results show that the students struggled to use keys; thus, help from the teacher was necessary to develop scientific skills as observe, compare, classify and identify.

AB This paper presents an active learning approach that focuses on practical investigation of the ecosystem of tidal flats using 3D modeling and printing for biology students in order to enhance understanding of natural selection. The learning approach for the study followed a 5-step procedure: i) learning about 3D modeling and printing, ii) exploration of the ecosystem of tidal flats, iii) 3D designing of a bird beak, iv) 3D printing of a constructed beak, and v) a natural selection simulation activity. The learning method presented in this study centered on active student exploration of the tidal flats ecosystem using 3D modeling and printing. The learning approach presented in this paper could be implicated at schools to aid in students' understanding of natural selection as it allows students to firsthand examine simulation changes to a bird beak and benthic communities. This study suggested the active learning method for natural selection as it incorporates student-designed exploration and direct investigative appraisal of the selection process.

   concept; species pluralism
ID HISTORY; MODELS
AB Even though the concept of species is central in biology, the history of species concept and the existence of different species concepts are rarely discussed in biology classroom. This is unfortunate, as teachers could use the plurality of species concepts to enrich discussion in the classroom. Therefore, knowing the students' perception of species is essential to plan compatible strategies for teaching species. An open-ended question was administered to 548 high school students. A semantic network analysis was then used to explore the ideas of species in the students' responses, and further analyses were conducted to observe the co-existence of those ideas. The following five concepts were found: species as the lowest taxon in taxonomy (A1), species as a type of animal or plant (A2), species as the basic classification of living things (A3), genetic species concept (A4), and morphological species concept (A5). Of the five species concepts, naive ideas were more frequent among responses, and some of them co-existed with normative ideas. As students mainly learn the concept of species through biology instruction, in this study, we have discussed the implications of our results for biology teaching and learning.

ID TERMINOLOGY; CONCEPTIONS
AB The current A-level biology curriculum includes a broad coverage of all the biosciences which demands knowledge of a wide range of biological vocabulary. Students (n = 184) from two UK universities were presented with a list of vocabulary, associated with a 'Revise Biology' text which highlighted key terms that students should know. Lecturers (n = 26) were asked which of these terms they expected students to know, or be aware of. Findings revealed that students' claimed knowledge of vocabulary exceeded lecturer expectations. In addition, there were a number of terms which students did not understand and lecturers did not expect them to know, which could be removed from A-level biology courses. This is discussed in relation to whether A-level curricula need to be so content heavy and whether lecturers would benefit from knowing more about their students' knowledge of discipline-specific terms.

ID PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
AB Visual representations are a familiar element of daily life and particularly beneficial as illustrations in science textbooks. In this case, learners draw on human dimensions such as cognitive style (CS) and prior knowledge (PK) when engaging in visual thinking. This study aimed to compare and explore the relationships among the format aspect (e.g. searching process), the content aspect (e.g. comprehension and interpretation), and the subject aspect (CS and PK) as applied when viewing two given hierarchical chromosome structure illustrations: the Mami version and the miMa version. Interviews were conducted with 7th graders given the illustrations. Participants' CS and PK were determined by Group Embedded Figures Test and Prior Knowledge Assessment. The results were consonant with the framework that most participants' searching process was conducted from top to bottom for both illustrations. Second, participants from both CS groups and low PK score group (PKL) were more capable of comprehending the Mami version than the miMa version. Third, learners typically applied a decomposed strategy in interpreting the Mami version. Fourth, the field dependent group and PKL group require further guidance when interpreting the miMa version. The implications of this study will focus on curriculum design, textbook or instructional materials, and instruction.

AB In this paper, I explore how seamless embedding of four mathematical concepts: counting, ratio, distribution, and statistical significance, into a unit on inheritance enables students to gain a deeper insight into biological phenomena than a qualitative only approach achieves. The topic of Mendelian inheritance is used to illustrate this proposal. An introductory activity is presented that separates the specialized genetics vocabulary from the inheritance process, allowing the initial mathematical relationship to be developed and subsequently followed by the language requirements.

ID AUTHENTIC SCIENCE
AB Teachers conceptualise inquiry learning in science learning differently. This is particularly evident when teachers are introduced to inquiry pedagogy within a new context. This exploratory study draws on semi-structured interviews conducted with eight pre-service secondary biology teachers following a day visit with university tutors to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew. Emerging findings were: first, pre-service biology teachers' views of inquiry learning range in sophistication from simple notions of learning from doing' to complex multi-notions such as student generated questions, developing curiosity and encouraging authentic scientific practices. Second, similarly their views of inquiry learning opportunities in botanical gardens ranged from simply places that offered memorable experiences' to enabling autonomous learning due to the organism diversity and multiple climates. Pre-service teachers categorised as having unsophisticated views of inquiry learning had limited expectations of botanical gardens as productive learning environments. Third, the majority of pre-service teachers were concerned about managing inquiry learning. A tension was identified between how open-ended an inquiry activity could be whilst ensuring student focus. Further, participants were concerned about the practical management of inquiry learning. We discuss implications for teacher educators and botanical garden educators and the requirement for curriculum development and promotion.

ID COMPETENCE; MODEL
AB A variety of practices and specialised representational systems are required to understand, communicate and construct molecular genetics knowledge. This study describes teachers' use of multimodal representations of molecular genetics concepts and how their strategies and choice of resources were interpreted, understood and used by students to demonstrate their conceptual understanding. Recordings of teachers' and students' discourse around representations, teacher interviews and student pre- and post-tests were used as data sources. Vignettes of students' dialogue with teachers around the form and function of representations and teacher interview responses highlight higher order conceptual understanding. Coding for cognitive domains within lesson phases where different modes of representation were utilised showed classrooms operated at higher domains compared to lessons where modalities were absent. This study shows how pedagogy that focuses on representational form and function as well as students' engagement in critical discussion around affordances and constraints of representations results in a higher cognitive engagement with molecular genetics knowledge.

AB Bryophytes are a rewarding study group in field biology and the UK bryophyte flora has international importance to biodiversity conservation. We designed an identification key to common woodland moss species and compared the usability of two formats, web-based multi-access and printed dichotomous key, with undergraduate students. The rate of correct species identification and identification speed both showed an advantage for the printed dichotomous key. Our findings suggest that, even in the digital age, printed keys remain valuable in biological education and that quality of key design is more important than presentation medium. We discuss the relative advantages of multi-access and dichotomous keys and how to approach bryophyte identification with beginners.

In South Africa, attempts to reduce the spread of HIV include incorporating HIV/AIDS education in the biology curriculum. However, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of biology-based HIV/AIDS education. The current study therefore aimed to identify strategies that can be used to enhance biology students' understanding of HIV/AIDS and promote the use of this knowledge in their daily lives. A predominantly qualitative mixed-method approach with Delphi technique was used to gather and analyse data from secondary school biology students and teachers, as well as HIV/AIDS experts specialising in medicine and research. Findings show that most students rely on knowledge learnt in biology to make decisions related to HIV/AIDS. Respondents suggested that HIV/AIDS education should be taught collaboratively by teachers, people living with HIV, and HIV/AIDS experts. Biology concepts and teaching strategies that could enhance students' understanding of HIV/AIDS, which are not part of the current biology curriculum, were identified.

AB This study involved the development and application of a two-tier diagnostic test for measuring students' understanding of cell division and reproduction. The instrument development procedure had three general steps: defining the content boundaries of the test, collecting information on students' misconceptions, and instrument development. Misconception data were collected from interviews and multiple-choice questions with open response. The data were used to develop fourteen two-tier multiple-choice items. The conceptual knowledge examined was preliminary functions of cell division, basic processes in cell division, mitotic cell cycle and asexual reproduction, the role of meiosis in sexual life cycles, as well as cell types and cell division. The diagnostic instrument was administered to 403 high-school students. The reliability coefficient of the test was 0.81. Difficulty indices ranged from 0.31 to 0.72, and discrimination indices ranged from 0.23 to 0.61. Results of the cell division and reproduction diagnostic test suggested that students did not acquire a satisfactory understanding of cell division and reproduction concepts. The obtained misconceptions and the reasons for them were discussed in the analysis of the items which could inform biology instruction and resource.

AB In this study we describe the support provided by a biology teacher during learning using a web-based research simulation that makes use of authentic research practices in genetics, including the use of a heuristic strategy to compare mutated and normal versions of a character at all the organisational levels. Authentic scientific practices include the use of conditional knowledge - namely coordination between declarative and strategic knowledge - which is not typically found in regular school tasks. Thus, it is unlikely that students will be able to carry out such coordination without guidance from their teacher. Our research question was: what kind of support does a teacher provide during enactment of the research simulation and how does it facilitate students' ability to coordinate between declarative and strategic knowledge? We observed one teacher and her students during the enactment of the research simulation in class. Our analysis revealed the support given by a teacher to promote students' use of conditional knowledge in a high-school biology classroom, was similar to the use of such knowledge by scientists in the course of performing authentic research.

AB Bias assessment (systematic errors) is fundamental in industry and service laboratories, where reliable results must be obtained to give correct answers to specific problems. Therefore, knowledge and practice in quality methodologies is of fundamental importance for students. Unfortunately, laboratory lessons often focus on connecting theory and practice without developing the quality assurance skills that employers consider to be useful. Here, an external quality methodology based on proficiency testing schemes has been developed to introduce students to the methodologies and skills that are required to detect and find the source of biased results in the laboratory. It has been found that a large percentage of results obtained during laboratory lessons are in fact biased. The new methodology obliges students to practise how to detect biased results and, specially, the critical thinking skills that are needed to reveal the sources of bias in the laboratory. In the case study evaluated here, the application of the proposed methodology allowed students to detect the source of their biased result in 95% of the cases. Errors found were mainly due to personnel errors, as a consequence of deficits in basic hands-on skills and calculation errors.

AB This exploratory multiple-case study investigated the belief systems (professed and enacted) of four secondary school biology teachers towards teaching through dialogic argumentation. The constant comparison method was used to iteratively assess the qualitative data, which included classroom observations, field notes, transcripts of the formal and informal interviews and teachers' reflections, and classroom video and audio recordings. Three themes emerged to represent the teachers' belief systems for teaching through dialogic argumentation: 1) using 'inter-language'; 2) scaffolding the negotiated consensus; and 3) 'taking up' and 'referring back' to students' ideas. Moreover, two other interesting results were revealed. First, the study corroborates previous results which state that teachers' intentions or predispositions in addition to their eagerness and willingness to use reform-based strategies pushed them towards successful implementation of their strategies for teaching through dialogic argumentation. Second, the strategies they implemented somehow revealed how they view dialogic argumentation as an approach to the co-construction of knowledge in science teaching and learning. The study offers implications for future professional development in terms of improving other aspects, such as teachers' understanding of the advantages of reform-based strategies and constant mentoring which may also influence their intentions to achieve the curriculum goals.

AB This study explored the usefulness of the open dialogue strategy to help Saudi Arabian primary teachers teach, and fourth-grade students learn, the key biological concept of classification, which is a significant challenge for students to grasp, especially the concept of humans versus animals. The convenience sample comprised N = 84 Grade four students (50% female, 50% male) in the 2018 Autumn term from four schools (two boys/two girls) in one city in the Northern region of Saudi Arabia and four (N = 4) teachers (self-selected sampling), one for each of four classes. A content and conversational analysis of translated and transcribed transcripts of the researcher's classroom observations, interpreted through the communicative approach, the Intermental Development Zone (IDZ), and exploratory talk, affirmed the effectiveness of open dialogue in Saudi primary science classes. Findings showed that, to move through the dialogue process and learn about the scientific concept of classification, students drew on (a) their religious views, (b) their personal religious beliefs and (c) the notions of Darwin's theory of evolution and Islamic creationism. Findings affirmed that using dialogue in primary science classes helped students learn aspects of the Saudi science curriculum. Findings further supported preparing preservice and inservice Saudi science teachers in both planned and open dialogue teaching strategies.

AB Most biology undergraduates learn about mutations in multiple classrooms throughout their college career. Understanding personalised genome test results, genome editing controversies, and the appearance of new variants of viruses or antibiotic resistant bacteria all require foundational knowledge about mutations. However, the abstract nature of molecular processes surrounding mutations makes them one of the more difficult topics for students to understand and apply. Instructors need valid assessment tools to document student understanding and tailor their instructional methods to address student knowledge gaps. We describe here the development and validation of the Mutations Criterion Referenced Assessment (MuCRA). This formative assessment was developed through an iterative process involving expert feedback and student responses to both open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The final MuCRA is composed of 10 multiple-choice questions aligned with three learning objectives. The item difficulty for each question was between 0.32-0.65, while the discrimination index ranged from 0.31-0.75 and the reliability (KR20) for the MuCRA was 0.69. The congruence analyses demonstrated distractors are capturing student misconceptions in 9/10 questions. These data indicate that the MuCRA can be used to reliably assess student learning and common misconceptions about mutations.

AB This study compares anatomy diagram production skills as a part of Visual Literacy competence in Biology Education in schoolchildren (n = 254) and pre-service teachers (n = 282). Both groups produced cross-sectional anatomy diagrams from knowledge acquired using frontal views and answered a questionnaire on their difficulties with the exercise. Overall, children performed better than teachers. However, both groups scored very low, revealing a lack of Visual Literacy, but also low content knowledge. Participants recognised their difficulty visualising the requested cross-section, especially with the distribution and size of organs. These results provide evidence of the need to improve anatomical knowledge and Visual Literacy skills in teacher training, since future teachers must teach these topics in schools.

AB The purpose of this study, grounded in the Achievement Goal Perspective Theory (AGPT) and a Caring framework, was to effectively adapt previously validated measures of caring, task-involving (CTI), and ego-involving (EI) climates for college exercise classes to the college biology laboratory setting. The items' measurement quality was assessed over two studies. Students (N-Study1 = 249, female 73%; N-Study2 = 199, female 78%) enrolled in biology laboratory courses were invited to complete a survey during the last two weeks of their laboratory course. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed overall good fit; however, two EI items had low loadings, so their wording was revised for Study 2. CFA results of Study 2 provided reliability and validity support for the use of these relatively brief and easy to administer measures in the college laboratory setting. This research provides additional support for creating CTI climates in the college laboratory setting.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preliminary outcomes of a learning community intervention (LC), which was based on the performance pyramid theoretical model of student supports. The LC integrated college algebra into biology course work. We used a quasi-experimental design to compare LC students to separate General Biology I and College Algebra course control groups on respective measures of biology and algebra course knowledge, and an assessment of perceived performance pyramid supports. Participants included 198 students (LC, n = 22; biology control, n = 52; mathematics control, n = 124) at a Historically Black University in the Southern United States. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that the LC students had significantly greater performance from pre- to post-test on a measure of biology course knowledge (Cohen's d = 0.76) compared to the biology control group. An ANCOVA indicated that the LC and mathematics control students performed similarly on a measure of algebra course knowledge. Group differences from a multivariate analysis of covariance on perceived performance pyramid supports were mostly statistically non-significant. Overall, the LC increased biology course performance. Implications for improving biology course performance and better assessment of students' perceptions of support for academic success are discussed.

AB Research on Mobile Augmented Reality (Mobile AR) includes studies addressing Mobile AR integration into learning environments along with the quality of instructions by researchers about using mobile AR in classrooms. Findings revealed that even inexperienced teachers/pre-service science teachers who lacked any prescribed material could use mobile AR, for which teaching materials are scant. This study aimed to reveal which teaching strategy pre-service science teachers preferred and how they integrate the strategy in Anatomy 4D and Elements 4D applications to enrich worksheets. The survey method was used to probe pre-service science teachers? integration of mobile AR technology into their worksheets. Participants, who were 81 senior pre-service science teachers (64 females, 17 males; ages 19 to 21), attended a 14-week elective course. Data were obtained from worksheets produced in the 3(rd) to 6(th) weeks during of the course. The sequences for inductive, inquiry, and expository strategy were adopted as the coding scheme. It was concluded that pre-service science teachers used inductive strategy instead of expository or inquiry teaching strategy in their worksheets. The current study suggests that pre-service science teachers should be advised to use inquiry strategy for integrating mobile AR into science worksheets.

AB This study explores the progression in the perceptions that pre-service primary teachers have about the interdependence of people and invertebrate organisms, after implementing an inquiry proposal. By means of an inductive analysis, the reports made by the pre-service teachers were assessed and grouped into four models, according to the level of relationship between invertebrates and society they established. The results suggest that the participants had certain willingness to build simple relationships. Nevertheless, the progression towards more-complex relationships based on an understanding of the ecosystem services provided by invertebrates would require opportunities for the pre-service teachers to explore their direct and indirect relationships with their everyday life. Moreover, the utilitarian vision of invertebrates as a resource might not be enough to understand the complexity of conservation problems, which requires a systemic vision to interpret the causes and consequences in the different environmental, socio-economic dimensions.

AB Among the efforts directed at remediating contaminated sites, the use of immobilized microorganisms is an appealing alternative because it offers several advantages over the use of free cells, including protecting cells from the toxic effects of hazardous compounds and increasing their survival and metabolic activity. Pseudomonas putida is an ubiquitous bacterium which, either as free cells (i.e. in its planktonic state) or immobilized in Ca-alginate beads, is able to effectively degrade pollutants such as cationic surfactants. In this paper, we propose a simple and fast technique to immobilize P. putida cells by entrapment in Ca-alginate matrix, and the use of this system and the free cells to estimate the removal of the surfactant Br-tetradecyltrimethylammonium (TTAB). Measurement of residual TTAB with a simple colorimetric method shows that the compound can be removed both by planktonic and immobilized cells. Taking into account that the TTAB-removal rate is higher with immobilized cells than with free cells, the laboratory practical class aims at demonstrating one of the advantages of using immobilized cells in remediation processes. The class is addressed to undergraduate students of biological sciences, engineering and biotechnology, and it could also be applied to evaluate the removal of other pollutants with immobilized microorganisms.

AB In the world of higher education, one of the struggles instructors face in the classroom is engaging students in the material. A second discussion in higher education pedagogy is how to weigh content versus activity in the science classroom. How should college teaching be set up when students now have every fact ever found at their fingertips on a device no larger than a half sandwich? What is the correct balance in the classroom between content/ knowledge and activity? As instructors grapple with these questions, a new type of learning experience called the Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) has been developed, whereby students engage in an authentic research question in a classroom and laboratory setting. CUREs have been shown to be effective learning experiences for students but can be difficult to implement. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a versatile and easy to use organism in the classroom that can be used for a wide variety of classroom activities. Described herein are a number of ways an instructor can use yeast in the classroom for authentic research experiences, especially focused towards a CURE.

AB The history of science is an important component to acquire for achieving scientific literacy. In this study, a collaborative activity was applied in which the students were presented with the historical context in which Robert Hooke lived and developed the first register of the microscopic world. Furthermore, the students explored the environment using a microscope made by themselves, employing PET bottles and lenses obtained from CD or DVD readers and, finally, they drew and described selected objects, and collaboratively rewrote a new version' of Hooke's classical book Micrographia'. The study was performed in a secondary school, with 12- to 15-year-old students, and the hypothesis was that the planned intervention could enlarge students' perception of historical aspects of the scientific discovery of the microscopic world, to a greater extent than traditional classes involving lectures and textbooks. The comparison was evaluated using a quantitative tool, called the History-Word-Association test (HWAT), which aims to evaluate the general vision of students regarding the agents, historical period and sociocultural circumstance involved in the issue addressed. The students that participated in the planned didactic activity showed a significant improvement in identification and retention of ideas associated with the history of the discovery of the microscopic world.

ID NONEQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS; CELL
AB All living structures, from archaea to human, are open thermodynamic systems analysed through nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics is a field with important applications to life sciences, which is very often left out of life science courses. A three-step method is suggested to make an easy introduction of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to life science students. The first step is to introduce the Prigogine equation dS=d(e)S+d(i)S, and explain the meaning of the entropy exchange with the surroundings d(e)S and internal entropy generation in the system d(i)S. The second step is to show that the Prigogine equation is connected to the equilibrium thermodynamics already known to students. This can be done by deriving the Clausius inequality dSdq/T, from the Prigogine equation applied to reversible and irreversible processes in closed systems. Reversible and irreversible processes are discussed separately and the results are then combined into the Clausius inequality. The third step is to introduce the fact that the Prigogine equation has a variety of applications in life sciences. This would give the students an opportunity to understand the entropy balance of physiological processes in cells and organisms. The import and accumulation of entropy, entropy generation, and entropy export could be made easier for students to adopt.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Citizen science is a rapidly growing emerging field in science and it is gaining importance in education. Therefore, this study was conducted to document the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of biology teachers who participated in a citizen science project involving observation of wild bees and identification of butterflies. In this paper, knowledge about how these biological methods can be taught to students is presented. After two years in the project, four teachers were interviewed and their PCK was captured in the form of content representations (CoRes) and Pedagogical and Professional-Experience Repertoires (PaP-eRs). These results can help future citizen science projects to link their activities to the school curriculum. But not only success can be reported: although one of the project team's aims was to make the Nature of Science accessible to the teachers and students in the course of the project, the teachers did not take this aspect into account. This paper discusses the possible reasons and proposes various strategies for improving citizen science in the context of school biology learning.

AB Evolutionary theory is central to the biological sciences, and to critical aspects of everyday life, and yet a significant proportion of Americans reject evolution. Our study sets out to examine the role of a second year college general education course in affecting students' acceptance of evolution. We report three years of data using the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) instrument, and show that students make small and sometimes statistically significant gains in acceptance over the course of a semester. We found no evidence that including evolution topics in coursework caused an overall decrease in acceptance of evolution. We suggest that increased coursework on evolution topics, especially using interactive teaching methods, may increase acceptance of evolution.

ID BIOLOGY; SCHOOLCHILDREN; EXPERIENCE; EDUCATION; PROTECT; IDEAS; FEAR
AB Research has shown that hands-on activities in biology/science education tend to improve children's attitudes towards science. These hands-on activities can influence children's interest in various ways, perhaps because they invoke varying emotions. We used a sample of 10-12-year-old children (n=142) to examine the effect of hands-on activities with living snails on children's achievements and disgust sensitivity. Children with living snails received significantly higher knowledge scores about snails measured with both a knowledge test and with analyses of drawings as compared with control children who received a traditional lecture without living snails. Disgust sensitivity was significantly lower in the experimental group and children who scored higher on the disgust scale received a lower knowledge test score. It would seem that the emotion of disgust negatively correlates with achievement.

AB This study shows that formative methods and increased student participation has a positive influence on learning measured as grades. The study was conducted during the course Biology A in a Swedish Upper Secondary School. The students constructed grade criteria and defined working methods and type of examination within a given topic, Gene technology. The procedure resulted in variation within teaching and examination carried out as an oral test in small groups. In the analysis, students' grades on Gene technology were analysed in comparison with grades on other topics within the course, and the results show that mean grade is significantly higher on Gene technology. Based on the results and student course evaluations, I discuss the reasons behind the good results and the relation to participation, student interest, teacher and type of examination.

DE Evolutionary tree; Evolution; Heat map; Cladogram; Pedigree; Rooted tree
ID BIOLOGY
AB Evolutionary trees are key tools for modern biology and are commonly portrayed in textbooks to promote learning about biological evolution. However, many people have difficulty in understanding what evolutionary trees are meant to portray. In fact, some ideas that current professional biologists depict with evolutionary trees are neither clearly defined nor conveyed to students. To help biology teachers and students learn how to more deeply interpret, understand and gain knowledge from diagrams that represent ancestor-descendant relationships and evolutionary lineages, we describe the different rooted and unrooted evolutionary tree visualisations and explain how they are best read. Examples from a study of tree-shaped diagrams in the journal Science are used to illustrate how to distinguish evolutionary trees from other tree-shaped representations that are easily misunderstood as visualising evolutionary relationships. We end by making recommendations for how our findings may be implemented in teaching practice in this important area of biology education.

TI To Fly or Not to Fly: Teaching advanced secondary school students about
   principles of flight in biological systems
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Interdisciplinary education; Aerodynamic principles; STEM education;
   Biological flight
ID DIRECTED AERIAL DESCENT; HYMENOPTERA; FORMICIDAE
AB Biological flight mechanics is typically taught in graduate level college classes rather than in secondary school classes. We developed an interdisciplinary unit for advanced upper-level secondary school students (ages 15-18) to teach the principles of flight and applications to biological systems. This unit capitalised on the tremendous biological diversity seen in powered flight (the rock pigeon, Columba livia), gliding (the colugo, Galeopterus variegatus and the flying snake, Chrysopelea paradisi) and passive transport (the wheat rust fungus, Puccinia graminis). These biological systems were translated through the construction and operation of remote-controlled gliders. The unit was conducted in three parts: a 20-minute recorded video on aerodynamic principles (Part 1), a 2.5-hour session including the aerodynamic applications to biological systems and the construction of the remote-controlled gliders (Part 2), and a two-hour session for testing, calibration and operation (flying) of the gliders (Part 3). Following this lesson, students will be able to take elements from multiple disciplines and synthesise them in new ways to give original insights in answering critical-thinking questions inspired by biological flight. Introducing students to interdisciplinary approaches early in their academic careers not only enhances their present learning, but also prepares them for future interdisciplinary environments. This unit could easily be adapted by other educators to fit the needs of specific secondary school and/or college classes.

AB This article presents research concerning the way in which primary school pupils in southern Spain interpret the concepts of population and species. The results show that, for the concept of population, there was an intense anthropocentrism in pupils' responses, while for the concept of species, only animals were considered as living creatures. These interpretations influence the vision that the students will develop of ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as their respect and care for living beings. We propose some suggestions in order to improve the teaching of these concepts in primary education.

One of the main challenges for higher education educators is to design courses in a way that will effectively promote the various learning outcomes of EfS. A central question is how sustainability should be integrated into the curriculum; which topics should be taught and which pedagogies ought to be applied to improve students' knowledge, skills and motivation to promote sustainable living. The present study aimed to contribute to the knowledge about students' learning outcomes yielded by different designs of EfS courses. This multiple-case study of three courses used a mixed-methods design. For each course, we identified its characteristics and analysed students' self-reported learning outcomes. We found that: (1) a course with a higher degree of participatory learning, employing a system approach, promoted the highest and most varied learning outcomes; (2) the lecture-based course yielded the fewest learning outcomes; and (3) field trips promoted learning outcomes only when accompanied by more advanced pedagogies.

AB The study examines the effectiveness of eco-schools concerning their students' environmental values and environmental behaviour, and includes 1287 children from fifty-nine schools (thirty-eight eco-schools and twenty-one control schools) in Flanders. Controlling for effects of gender and socio-economic status, analyses show that eco-schools have no effect on the environmental behaviour of their students or on their preservation values. Eco-school students do, however, show lower utilisation values than control school students. Results furthermore indicate that preservation values and not utilisation values impact environmental behaviour. Eco-schools thus seem to be applying a pedagogical approach that impacts only on utilisation values but through that fails to affect their students' preservation values and, with those, their environmental behaviour. Directions for future research are suggested.

AB We describe the development of a mini-library of human DNA fragments for use in an enquiry-based learning (EBL) undergraduate practical incorporating 'wet-lab' and bioinformatics tasks. In spite of the widespread emergence of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the cloning and analysis of DNA fragments in Escherichia coli remains a fundamental skill commonly taught to undergraduate biology students. The individual procedures are simple enough, but enthusiastic engagement of the students in practical exercises requires that a better learning experience be offered to them than the simple opportunity to participate. To address this issue we have prepared a mini-library of well-characterised fragments of human DNA in a small plasmid vector. We have generated high-quality sequence data for each end of the human DNAs and there are sufficient clones for around 80 students to each engage in a series of enquiry-based activities producing results that are unique to each student. This resource allows the students to experience the real-life integration of 'wet-lab' and bioinformatics approaches in modern molecular genetics. The experimental procedures are aimed at molecular genetics students commencing their second year of undergraduate study, but the materials could also be used with more advanced groups, up to and including masters degree level, by appropriate adaptation and extension of the range of experimental techniques used.

AB Despite the fact that some educational researchers believe that laboratory courses promote outcomes in cognitive and affective domains in science learning, others have argued that laboratory courses are costly in relation to their value. Moreover, effective measurement of student learning in the laboratory is an area requiring further investigation. The present study set out to examine learning outcomes by measuring students' academic performance and their skill in writing research proposals and investigated students' views about laboratory courses through interviews. Comparisons were made between students taking lectures only (control group) and students enrolled in both lecture and laboratory courses (experimental group). A total of 78 undergraduate students participated in the study. Stepwise discriminant analysis, analysis of covariance, and multidimensional scaling were used to analyse the data. Results showed that students in the experimental group did not perform as well as students in the control group in examination questions that required rote memorisation but they performed better than their counterparts in classification of species and in essay writing. In addition, in terms of research study design, proposals written by students in the experimental group were not only of higher quality but also more consistent in quality than those written by students in the control group. Implications for curriculum design and future research are described with respect to the innovative measurements and analytical methods we used to evaluate laboratory learning outcomes, the role of laboratory courses in biology teaching, and students' learning styles.

ID SKILLS
AB Systems thinking in biology education is an up and coming research topic, as yet with contrasting feasibility claims. In biology education systems thinking can be understood as thinking backward and forward between concrete biological objects and processes and systems models representing systems theoretical characteristics. Some studies claim that systems thinking can be readily introduced at the level of primary-school education; other studies claim that even in upper secondary-school education the introduction of systems thinking requires a carefully outlined approach in order not to strain students' capacities too much. In order to explain these contrasting claims a procedure of analysis was used to map and compare the conceptual frameworks of the various studies, focusing on the selection of systems, references to systems theory and definitions of systems thinking. The analysis demonstrates that the frameworks include different elements of systems thinking. In particular, the analysis shows that the studies recommending the introduction of systems thinking in primary- or lower secondary-school education did not measure students' ability to think forward and backward between concrete objects and systems models. The analysis contributes to a discussion about useful preparatory learning and teaching trajectories, preceding the formal introduction of systems thinking.

ID PHOTOGRAPHS; IDEAS; LIONS
AB This article analyses how rainforests are portrayed in children's resources. Twenty books and 12 websites on rainforests, designed for pupils aged between 9 and 14 years, were examined to determine the types and range of animals depicted and how plant life in general is portrayed. The most commonly depicted animal was the orang-utan and other endangered animals featured strongly. Mammals and reptiles were over-represented compared with their actual presence in rainforests, while fish and invertebrates were under-represented. Animal size was sometimes misleading and there was an emphasis on colourful and dangerous species. Most resources included diagrams depicting the vertical stratification of the forest, and large, rare and colourful plants were common. The implications of the findings for teaching and learning about rainforests are addressed.

AB The ability to design appropriate experiments in order to interrogate a research question is an important skill for any scientist. The present article describes an interactive lecture-based activity centred around a comparison of two contrasting approaches to investigation of the question Can you smell fear? A poorly designed experiment (a video clip from the TV series Brainiac science abuse) is considered alongside the methods used in a peer-reviewed paper examining the same issue. The exercise is applicable both for students in their later years of secondary education and during the first year of a university-level bioscience course.

AB Education for scientific literacy entails the development of scientific knowledge and the ability to apply this knowledge and value judgments to decisions about real-life issues. This paper reports an attempt to involve secondary level biology students in making decisions about an authentic socio-scientific issue - that of bat conservation - through a classroom activity A decision making framework adapted from the literature was designed to help students tackle the issue from multiple perspectives with due consideration given to relevant scientific knowledge, rational argumentation, and the values underlying the possible options. An evaluation of the results showed that there were considerable changes in the students' decisions before and after the activity thus reflecting a change in values from an anthropocentric viewpoint to an eclectic perspective that emphasizes both utilitarian and biocentric values.

AB The current pandemic has highlighted the importance of hand hygiene as a preventive measure to avoid the transmission of diseases. It is a habit that should be reinforced during childhood, so that it lasts into adulthood. The main objective was to analyse and describe, through drawing, the mental schemas that 6-12 year-old pupils have about clean and dirty hands and their relationship with microorganisms. A descriptive and qualitative study was carried out with 260 participants in which their drawings were analysed according to thecategories: colouring, shape and/or presence of wounds, viruses or living beings, localisation and presence of accessories. The results show that dirty hands are represented coloured in sections combining various shapes and, in some cases, living beings or viruses can be found. Among 11-12 year-old students there are very few cases where dirt is represented as dots or reference is made to microscopic size, with neutral and warm colours being the most used. Clean hands are represented by the silhouette of the hand in a single colour. Sometimes accessories are added to reinforce the idea of cleanliness and it is not conceivable that a clean hand could harbour microorganisms or dirt.

AB This paper presents an analysis of the socio-scientific dimensions which 46 11(th) graders, enrolled in the subject scientific culture, consider to justify their COVID-19 vaccination decision and how they managed to combine and integrate these dimensions before and after working on a sequence of activities aimed at learning about argumentation in science. Although almost all the students intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19, the results show that before the sequence, they used one or two dimensions to justify their decision, while after it, some combined up to five dimensions. The ethical and social-cultural dimensions were two of the most frequently used. The scientific dimension was infrequent in the initial argument but was, however, the most used dimension in the final argument, after the intervention. Working on socioscientific issues encourages the development of argumentation skills, and, in this specific case, health education skills as well.

AB Contemporary education adopts various new visualisation techniques for content to be learned. Recently, research on the application of 3D modelling and printing (3DMP) has been expanding. However, as the latest literature reviews indicate, little research is available on the contribution of 3DMP to learning of students with blindness (SWB) and students without disabilities (SWOD). This research aims to fill the gap through an exploratory case study, conducted in an inclusive Biology classroom in a primary school. Eight SWOD and four SWB (12 years old) participated in the study. The focus of the research was on pre-interventional and post-interventional students' knowledge about cells, and students' views on using 3DMP in Biology education. The data was analysed using Grounded Theory. The results indicate that 3DMP contributes to students' learning by improving the ability to enumerate, describe, and visualise the cell and its parts, by remediating some of the students' misconceptions and by increasing communication within a classroom. In terms of encountered obstacles, SWB noted that the quality of 3D models could cause new misconceptions. Adjusting the ratio, positioning and scaling of printed objects, inaccuracy in printing, and long printing process, are some of the problems which students encounter in 3DMP.

AB This study aims to determine what pre-service teachers know about the path of water through the body, and how they intend to explain this knowledge to five-year-old preschool children. This study aims to see the opportunities young children in preschool can obtain from an explanation of the nature of science related to an everyday life activity. A questionnaire was distributed to 42 pre-service teachers participating in the study. They study part time at the university (75% studying and 25% working), and most of the students are or have been working in preschools. All the students have passed the mandatory science courses. Data were collected through a questionnaire where the students explained their knowledge using drawings, and explaining pedagogic standpoints in open-ended questions. The results concluded that four pre-service teachers could sufficiently explain the workings of three organ systems. However, only one of the four intended to mention the three systems necessary for providing a coherent explanation of the body to a five-year-old child. Even the pre-service teachers who could describe more than one system did not intend to explain what they knew to the children. A typical response from the students was that they would seek facts together with the child.

AB This study reports on the theoretical- and empirical-based design and evaluation of cell membrane biology learning activities within the Model of Educational Reconstruction and experiential realism. First, we designed analogy-based learning activities by considering students' and scientists' conceptions as described in the literature. Secondly, we carried out two video-taped teaching experiments to study students' learning processes when interacting with the learning activities. Interpreting students' conceptual development as thinking pathways enabled us to identify and understand the roots of their learning difficulties. Due to inherent ontological and epistemological presumptions, the students had difficulties in understanding that cell membrane structure determines their two-fold function: to separate and to connect environments in order to maintain living processes. The multiple analogies we employed helped foster conceptual development because they highlighted aspects of the concrete everyday experiences the students already had, but had not thought about. As a result of the learning activities, the students revised their conceptions regarding the terms barrier, gatekeeper and environment and connected these to a more coherent conceptual structure of cell membrane biology. Methods and outcomes of the study may contribute to a better understanding of how this important concept can be brought to science classrooms.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Although much research exists of students' alternative conceptions about evolution and natural selection, the way in which these vary in time and how scientific explanations change during instruction remains to be described and understood. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to characterise the nature of the change in student thinking about evolution through the mechanism of natural selection during a six-lesson intervention with a group of ninth-grade students (14-15 years old) from a private subsidised school in Chile. The study group included thirteen students to whom a pre- and post-test was applied using the questionnaire Assessment of Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORNS), and from whom short tasks were collected at the end of three lessons. The data were analysed using a quantitative and qualitative analysis of nine students grouped in five cases of study. The main patterns described here are the recurrence of the design teleology thinking in students, the initial use of key concepts such as mutation, survival, and differential reproduction during the trajectories, the abundance of mixed thinking during and at the end of the instruction, and the low coherence in the structure of thinking, both in time and through the different contexts analysed.

AB This study examines the epistemic disciplinary knowledge that students consider when addressing a real food emergency that requires their engagement in inquiry and argumentation practices. The study comprised two phases: 1) designing an experiment to study the emergency and 2) evaluating the real outcome of the emergency. The participants were 10(th) and 11(th) grade students (15-17 years old) working in small groups in the subject of Biology. Their conversations were examined through discourse analysis, for which two rubrics were developed, one for each phase of the task. The design phase related to the scientific practice of inquiry while the evaluation phase related to the scientific practices of inquiry and argumentation. The results suggest that not all the epistemic disciplinary knowledge promoted by the task was taken into consideration by students, especially in relation to the reproducibility of experiments and its feasibility to solve socio-scientific issues. This implies that epistemic disciplinary knowledge must be addressed in the classroom through an explicit-reflexive approach. Further directions and implications for biology teaching are provided.

TI Jigsaw dissection activity enhances student ability to relate morphology

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

ID SCIENCE
AB Functional feeding guild classification of aquatic insects is partly based on mouthpart morphology, but the link between mouthpart morphology and ecological feeding roles is often missed by students in the classroom. We implemented a Jigsaw activity in a freshwater biology course to help students connect morphology and ecology. Paired students dissected two common (to the whole class) and one unique aquatic insect's mouthparts and predicted their ecological feeding roles. Students then divided into new groups and taught peers about their unique insect. A pre- and post-activity survey measured students' ability to relate morphology and feeding roles. Open-ended questions graded via a rubric showed students scored significantly higher and provided more answers discussing feeding roles. Likert-type questions probing students' perceptions of mouthpart importance resulted in marginally higher importance ratings of mouthparts for identification but no differences for insect feeding. On an end-of-the-semester assessment, students generally rated the activity as helpful. Some reported the activity to be difficult due to small insect size. The activity enhanced students' understanding of the link between mouthparts and feeding roles but may have decreased their engagement due to perceived difficulty. Further modification alleviating difficulty may improve student perceptions while retaining knowledge gains.

TI Putting nature back into secondary biology education: a framework for
   integration
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article

ID DIRECT INSTRUCTION; FOLLOW
AB In the context of England, secondary biology education is dominated by sub-organismal systems, such as physiology, often to the detriment of evolution & ecology and impeding an integrated understanding of biology. This paper proposes a framework that teachers could use to help them consider how the learning of physiological and developmental systems can be combined with ecological and evolutionary thinking. Thus, keeping a balance between anthropomorphic contexts, and those of nature. The framework has two axes: physio-developmental - ecology, and contemporary - evolutionary, from which four quadrants emerge for consideration during topic design. It is proposed that topic design in general should be centred on the whole organism in its environment, which would ensure that physiological phenomena are contextualised in the organism's ecology. Furthermore, it is proposed that by pedagogical use of comparative biology, an evolutionary perspective can be integrated with organismal systems and ecology, whilst also offering more opportunities for students to discern the pattern being studied and be exposed to more non-human organisms. The framework is designed for practising teachers and would not require a radical change in pedagogy or teaching resources, but a new way of seeing the content and organisation of the course.

AB Topics associated with the biological sciences form a significant fraction of the curriculum in science at primary school level in the U.K. In this methodology paper we demonstrate how a wide range of research articles associated with the biological sciences can be disseminated to a primary school audience and how children can carry out investigations associated with cutting-edge research in the classroom. We discuss how the articles and accompanying Teacher Guides benefit children, primary teachers and other stakeholders including the researchers themselves. We define four types of research articles; ones that can be used in the primary school setting without much adaptation, others where an aspect can be used and some where an analogy can be used. For other research papers, it is not possible to mirror the research at all, but the area of the research is interesting to primary aged children and can be adapted so that they can see the impact of the science on real life. We provide exemplars of each type and some preliminary feedback on articles written.

AB The historical dimension of biology attests to the various conceptions of living organisms that have governed the construction of scientific knowledge over time, some of which still persist today. The present study aimed to identify and characterise the various conceptions of living organisms held by future teachers and biologists and the influence of university education (with or without a scientific profile). The results show that animist, vitalist, finalist, evolutionist, interactionist, hereditary and behavioural determinist conceptions coexist in explaining living organisms and the university education with a scientific profile appears to promote current conceptions over outdated ones. Thus, 80.6% of future science teachers and biologists rejected metaphysical explanations of living organisms, whereas 55.3% of future elementary and secondary school teachers accepted them. Yet, the results of this study also brought out finalist explanations of living organisms among the majority of both profiles, without (90.6%) and with science (79.0%), indicating that a poor understanding of evolutionism still persists today, despite a well-developed science culture. The continued existence of obstacle-conceptions and the influence on them of a well-developed science culture points to the importance of the quality of science education for gaining a better grasp of the concepts related to living organisms.

AB This study is a follow-up to the analysis of an inquiry-based learning activity applied to students in a public university in Brazil. We advocate that an effective education in immunology must incorporate elements that are essential to research in the area, such as generating and analysing data. These elements would empower students to apply science reasoning to face professional challenges. Our protocol included two of these elements: experimentation and abstraction. The utmost aim was to examine the production of argument by groups engaged in three different activities: 1) performing experiments and analysing the data generated; 2) reading papers on the subject (activation of complement) prior to the activities in (1), and 3) reading papers on the subject and analysing data generated by others. Our analysis reveals that guided scientific paper presentation was more influential than performing an experiment in terms of production of complex arguments. Additionally, we found that some groups merely described the data rather than relating the obtained data to the original question that led to the experiments. The findings described herein show the importance of engaging students in procedures that actually generate knowledge and thus incorporate scientific reasoning and discourse in higher immunology education.

AB UNESCO has identified education for sustainable development (ESD) as a key factor in the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Education is important in developing awareness of how to preserve natural ecosystems and promote the uptake of renewable energy sources. Ecology education in primary school aims to give students a scientific foundation to further their education in biology and develop environmentally literate citizens who will protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of natural ecosystems. This early education includes awareness of how human welfare depends on resilient ecosystems. However, previous studies have shown that young students face serious challenges when constructing a holistic view of ecological relationships. In this study, we interpret students' written texts and drawings on processes in an ecosystem. By focusing on students' expressed ideas on the availability of energy and matter in the ecosystem, we construe four models. The students in our study propose, firstly, that energy flows or can circulate, and secondly, that matter circulates, is provided by the sun, or is created anew. The students often express fragmented processes, combined in different ways. According to our results, we propose aspects that can inform the design of primary school teaching of ecology for sustainable development.

TI Learning perception of Veterinary students about cardiovascular
   physiology using a functional model
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Cardiology; graduate education; Physiology
AB Learning the physiology of the cardiovascular system can be difficult for students, but the use of active teaching methodologies can help and enhance learning. To facilitate the understanding of how the cardiovascular system works, we built a functional model for Veterinary Medicine students attending a cardiovascular physiology lecture and evaluated their self-reported perceptions of how well they learned. We used simple materials to construct the cardiovascular model, such as bottles of transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET), transparent tubing, rubber balloons, and rubber pears taken from aneroid manometers. Twenty-four veterinary students attended a traditional cardiovascular physiology lecture before being introduced to the functional model. Each student then filled out a structured questionnaire that assessed their learning perception. The data was analyzed by chi-squared (chi(2)) test. We observed that most students considered the use of the model to be a more efficient and satisfactory learning method (p < 0.05). The functional model proved to be a useful tool for learning cardiovascular system physiology. Through the model, the students were able to visualise the way that important structures function, an outcome that is often not possible in classes involving animal vivisections. Moreover, the model facilitates the teaching of the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system.

AB Students often have misconceptions about terrestrial carbon flows and there is a lack of coherence in students' explanations regarding the different levels of biological organisation at which these processes occur. In this study, problem-based teaching materials on the topic of terrestrial carbon flows were developed and tested with 15 students 18-19 years old (grade 12) using a pre/post-test design. Students focused on specific carbon flows in an ecosystem at the macro level (e.g. CO2 fixation and heterotrophic respiration) including specific related concepts at the micro level (e.g. photosynthesis and cellular respiration). The findings indicate that the teaching materials improved the students' understanding of terrestrial carbon flows and their ability to reason across the different levels of biological organisation. On the basis of these findings, implications for teaching terrestrial carbon flows in biological education are discussed.

AB Family planning, the prevention of unwanted pregnancy, and women's reproductive health are topics that have received close attention for decades. It would therefore be fair to assume that there exists a good knowledge of the menstrual cycle. However, it is clear that many people have various misconceptions about the menstrual cycle and fertile days or ovulation, and that this process is still largely taught with the aid of materials and images that have not changed for many years. We investigated the effect of moving away from the usual teaching practice of using a 28-day diagram showing ovulation on the 14th day. A total of 184 students from three different high schools, aged between 17 and 18, participated in this research. The students who were taught using three diagrams showing different durations of the menstrual cycle showed a significantly better adoption of the facts and concepts compared to the students who were taught using a diagram of the average 28-day cycle. Our results confirmed that it is highly important to use appropriate visual displays in the teaching of the menstrual cycle and that it is essential to enhance the visual literacy of students and teachers.

AB The present work was carried out with students of compulsory secondary education. The research was prompted by the idea that scientific vocation among young people is shrinking and that this has a significant impact on our society. Consequently, a science project based on the students' interests was proposed. They were able to work as a single group and design the methodology to achieve the goal they set: 'understanding how fish function and knowing all the organs they need to live underwater'. As this objective involves considering fish within a broader system, it seems their research work inspired system thinking. Nevertheless, during the experiment session, they tried to link their comments to a traditional evaluation. Their research questions were completely conditioned by what they thought they would be assessed on under usual conditions. On this basis, they only chose to know the name of the parts and their practical uses. Therefore, although they initially considered the environment as a part to study to learn how fish function, evaluation limited their research to finalist questions. Other results, such as observation of the peer learning process, are also shown.

AB The aim of the present assay is to provide a simple algorithm as well as a didactic theoretical framework that may serve as an introduction to understanding modern habitat suitability (HS) modelling techniques in Ecology and Biogeography. The proposal is built on classical descriptive statistics and classical ecological theories. Shelford's theory of a bell-shaped curve of tolerance is used to assign suitability values to individual sites, according to their deviations from the optimal requirements of a hypothetical biological species. Liebig's law of the minimum is applied to assess the overall suitability given a multivariate set of environmental factors. To illustrate the algorithms, hypothetical examples are given with small sets of values simulating data extracted from maps with environmental information. The reader/lecturer is invited to reproduce these small-scale examples using common spreadsheet software or to apply them at a large scale using raster datasets in any advanced geographic information system. As didactical outcomes, this algorithm allows introducing students to the general form and applications of bell-shaped exponential equations (with mu and sigma parameters), understanding the convenience of the law of the minimum when analysing multivariate datasets and the philosophical understanding of certainty/uncertainty when working with the multidimensional niche theory.

AB Laboratories are recognised as central in science education, allowing students to consolidate knowledge and master practical skills, however, their effectiveness has been questioned. Whilst laboratory practicals are useful for students' learning of basic procedures, they have been shown to be less effective for developing conceptual understanding of the subject. Interactive lectures and bespoke digital resources were utilised in order to enhance theoretical understanding of laboratory practical molecular sessions, thus enabling students to take responsibility for and direct their own learning, encouraging inquiry-based learning. Providing easy to access additional learning resources offered students an opportunity to better prepare themselves for the laboratory, and consolidate their knowledge through subsequent review and self-testing in their own time. Grades before and after implementation of these active learning strategies were analysed to look at the impact on student learning and this study demonstrates that integrating these into a challenging practical biology course improved grades significantly with a concomitant increase in the number of A' grades attained. Feedback to evaluate use and perceptions of both interactive lectures and digital resources were also analysed. It has been shown here that these activities enhanced student experience and understanding of the course.

DT Article
DE Laboratory practicals; Online quizzes; Student engagement
AB Laboratory practicals classes are an essential component of all science degrees, but are a pinch point because of rising student numbers, rising student expectations and falling student exposure to laboratory work prior to entering higher education. Augmentation of physical laboratory work with online interventions is not new, but as virtual laboratories become increasingly sophisticated, cutting-edge approaches have become less available to many institutions as they are unable to meet the investment or specialist skills needed to build or maintain these complex tools. This case study examines the possibilities for increasing student engagement with practical work using the simplest tools available in any standard virtual learning environment and available to all. Based on results obtained from a large student cohort, the results indicate that this low-cost, low-tech approach can achieve high levels of student satisfaction.

ID TEACHERS KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE
AB This study investigated biology teachers' (N = 148) understanding of models and modelling (MoMo), their model-related teaching activities and relations between the two. A framework which distinguishes five aspects of MoMo in science (nature of models, multiple models, purpose of models, testing models and changing models) served as a theoretical background. Teachers' understanding of MoMo was assessed using constructed-response items which were analysed qualitatively based on a coding scheme. The biology teachers mainly expressed a limited understanding of models as copies or idealised depictions used to show or to explain something. Model-related teaching activities were assessed through rating-scale items. The findings propose that models are primarily generated in biology lessons to show or to explain something but are rarely contrasted with other models, evaluated and modified. Significant correlations between teachers' understanding of the aspect testing models and their intensity of model-related teaching activities were found. This suggests that the aspect testing models is a key aspect of promoting teaching activities related to MoMo in biology lessons. The findings are discussed with respect to relevant literature about MoMo in science education and educational implications are provided.

DE Restriction assay; Lambda DNA; DNA methylation; Gel electrophoresis;
   Epigenetics
AB Our out-of-school practical exercise was designed to bring upper secondary school students in contact with one of the most exciting and expanding topics in biology today: epigenetics. In school, students only study the basics in genetics and the respective investigation techniques as provided by the syllabus. For a practical exercise in epigenetics, however, they need additional knowledge. Hence, they are introduced to the subject of epigenetics and its molecular mechanisms. Students are asked to examine the different DNA methylation conditions of lambda DNA using both a restriction assay and gel electrophoresis in an out-of-school laboratory. DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms which have significant effects on gene expression; studies on monozygotic twins have shown that it is influenced by the environment. This exercise enables students to correctly identify the different methylation conditions of distributed lambda DNA samples. In doing so, they receive a first introduction to one epigenetic mechanism. The necessity for students to experience science in out-of-school settings has been shown by several scholars. The practical exercise we are proposing in this article was elaborated for such learning opportunities for upper secondary students to gain insight into contemporary science issues.

AB Student interest in botany and enrolment in plant sciences courses tends to be low compared to that in other biological disciplines. One potential way of increasing student interest in botany is to focus on course material designed to raise student enthusiasm and satisfaction. Here, we introduce and evaluate virtual microscopy in botany teaching. Virtual microscopy uses high-resolution digital virtual slides' that allow students to explore microscope sections without the advanced skills required to prepare glass slides. Questionnaire feedback from students indicated that students found the virtual slides an effective learning tool. Further, we found that student performance in assessments was significantly higher when using virtual slides than when using traditional glass slides. We suggest that virtual slides are an effective tool for increasing student satisfaction in introductory botany courses, and have the potential for increasing student enrolment in higher-level courses (honours) and research degrees.

AB Students often prefer to study animals rather than plants, because they see plants as passive, less interesting organisms. This paper proposes a simple hands-on laboratory exercise for high-school students ( grade 12) to arouse their interest in learning about plants and to demonstrate to them that plants are active organisms capable of defending themselves. In this classroom exercise, students investigate how a plant responds to an invader. As a model for study, the exercise uses three organisms: red chilli fruit, the yeast biological control agent Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the pathogenic fungus Rhizopus stolonifer. Students gain basic knowledge about how plants defend themselves against pathogens by observing the physical changes of an infected wound site and by investigating the chemical compounds produced by plants in response to pathogen invasion; they are also encouraged to think critically about using biological control as a means to promote environmentally friendly agricultural practices.

AB Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigates and discusses neurological explanations for, and the educational implications of, the neural network activations involved in hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-understanding for biology education. Two sets of task paradigms about biological phenomena were designed: hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-understanding, and 60 healthy participants performed the tasks. fMRI results showed that participants utilised different neural networks during hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-understanding, and these networks appeared to have specialised patterns. In other words, these two types of learning strategies related to hypotheses do not share the same brain region or network. Therefore, for biology learning, it might be concluded that hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-understanding are operating at differing neural network levels, which causes the difficulty students have generating hypotheses about complicated natural phenomena despite a huge amount of exposure to hypothesis-understanding during their learning.

AB This article investigates the attitudes of South African student teachers towards the theory of evolution and their willingness to teach it. The teaching of evolution has been excluded from the South African school curriculum for most of the 20th century In 2008, Grade 12 learners were for the first time exposed to the concept of evolution in the Life Sciences curriculum. The participants in this study completed school prior to 2008 and thus have to interpret this curriculum with no or very little training in this topic. A questionnaire consisting of Likert-style and open-ended questions was administered to student teachers who intend to become secondary school biology teachers. A large percentage of the participants were found to reject the theory of evolution. In addition, the majority indicated that they are religious. Those who were more observant were more likely than their less observant counterparts to find evolution incompatible with their belief system and to renounce the theory of evolution. Although 70% of the participants felt that they were adequately prepared to teach evolution, the data shows that these student teachers have a poor understanding of evolution theory and that they harbour many misconceptions. In fact, less than half of the students support the teaching of evolution in South African schools. The article concludes with a number of recommendations.

AB Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted immensely on individuals and societies around the world. This study aimed at delineating Swedish middle school (10-12-year-old) pupils' understanding of bacteria and viruses, thereby illustrating the influence of the pandemic at schools and in society. Data was collected by semi-structured, individual interviews and by asking pupils to draw images. Thematic coding of interview transcripts and content analysis of pupils' annotated drawings were used. The morphology of microorganisms from the drawings was often 'corona-like', with a round shape and with protruding parts. Viruses were commonly considered larger than bacteria, but sometimes also similar in size. Interrelationships between bacteria and viruses were expressed with a superior microorganism. Pupils drew microorganisms as cell-like and never portrayed them as animals or with anthropomorphic features. Viruses were considered to cause a more severe disease than bacteria. Pupils seldomly tethered a specific virus to a specific infectious disease, and often named both (virus and disease) 'corona'. However, when they did make a connection, viruses were considered to cause flu and COVID-19, bacteria to cause cold and plague. In general, these results indicate that viruses received a more pronounced position amongst microorganisms in the minds of pupils in the aftermath of COVID-19.

AB The sustainability challenges facing humankind make necessary the convergence of Science Education (SE) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Science learning and ESD requires the adoption of student-centred transformative teaching methods that promote values and critical thinking. This article explores the role of citizen science (CS) as an educational tool that could contribute in such transformative teaching. Innovative ICT tools that enable teachers to more easily engage their pupils in CS-based activities tailored to their local environment and teaching objectives have been developed and implemented in eight case studies, involving 214 students and seven teachers from three schools in Greece, the United Kingdom, and Spain. The results showed that: a) the CS-based educational initiatives contributed to improving natural science learning and represented progress in the development and integration of students' competencies for sustainability; b) the developed ICT tools increased students' interest and motivation; c) versatile ICT tools and platforms for teachers' co-working can contribute to the inclusion of CS in the curriculum and thereby to the inclusion of ESD in schools. We conclude that such educational initiatives can contribute to the convergence of SE and ESD and help students develop global skills, preparing them for 21(st) century sustainability challenges.

AB The aim of this research is to examine the effects of laboratory activities based on the predict-observe-explain (POE) strategy on the understanding of photosynthesis and respiration concepts of pre-service science teachers, and their attitudes towards biology science and course and biology laboratory. Pre- and post-test designs with an experimental and a control group were used in the research. The research was implemented with participation of 64 the pre-service science teachers. For this purpose, the experimental and the control groups were randomly determined. The same laboratory activities were carried out using POE in the experimental group and utilising a traditional approach in the control group. For the data collection, a two-tier concept test, The Biology as a Science and Course Attitude Scale and the Biology Laboratory Attitude Scale were applied before and after the applications. The results indicated that the pre-service science teachers who were taught using laboratory activities based on the POE strategy had significantly higher scores in terms of achievement and attitude towards biology laboratory than those taught by the traditional approach. In this context, we recommend using and expanding laboratory activities based on active learning methods, such as POE in biology courses.

AB Case studies of two biology teachers, Cathy and David, from the same minority-majority, urban U.S. high school, provide insights into their instructional practices while they engaged in long-term professional development (PD). Findings suggest why science teachers engaged with PD may, or may not, adopt more adaptive pedagogical approaches in the service of reform-based teaching. Gee's institution- and affinity-identity constructs were used as analytic lenses regarding teachers' perceptions of teaching, learning, and agency in the dual contexts of their school's institutional environment and PD community. Over time, Cathy adopted more inquiry-based instructional practices she learned through PD seminars in building a scientific classroom discourse community with her majority Latinx students. Her professional identity and teaching became more aligned with the more progressive teaching philosophy and instructional practices promoted by the PD affinity group. While David understood and enjoyed the PD, ultimately, he minimally adopted new strategies, adhering mainly to his pre-PD mode of direct instruction, staying within the strict culture of accountability of his school's administrative priorities to raise state test scores. These cases demonstrate why some teachers of diverse students are adaptive adopters of reform-based instruction through new affinity group membership, while others demonstrate greater allegiance to their institution-aligned identities.

AB Biology education emphasises producing scientifically literate students, mastering biological knowledge, and developing critical thinking. However, in reality, biology instruction only focuses on academic achievement in the Indonesian biology curriculum. Previous research has found that scientific inquiry is a practical approach to improve academic achievement and scientific literacy. Interactive socio-scientific inquiry (ISSI) was developed based on a distinctive inquiry approach. The ISSI uses socio-scientific issues as a learning context and uses digital technology as an interaction platform. This research used a quasi-experimental design with a pre-test-post-test non-randomised control group involving 196 tenth-grade students. The findings revealed substantial differences in learning outcomes between ISSI students with conventional and classroom discussion teaching methods. The ISSI students have significant enhancements in scientific literacy, biological knowledge, and critical thinking. These findings suggest the utility of using socio-scientific issues (to be criticised and resolved) and digital technology (with its interactive involvement as a learning interaction platform) to complement inquiry in biology teaching. The ISSI is an alternative method to support biology teaching in becoming more creative and encourages secondary school students to be more critical in learning content.

ID PLACE
AB The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate Brazilian school teacher attitudes and approaches to biodiversity education. We aim to specifically compare the amount of native biodiversity topics as measured by teachers' reports of their teaching emphasis. The study involved 147 teachers from all geographic regions of the country, who answered a questionnaire containing both open- and Likert scale items to compare biodiversity-related contents. Findings reveal that the concepts with the greatest emphasis from teachers are those related to environmental conservation, while the least emphasised concepts are those about Brazilian biodiversity. This seems to lead to a paradox, since conservation-effective actions depend on the place-consciousness of biodiversity. Analysis of responses revealed the following common factors that negatively affect the teaching of native biodiversity: lack of knowledge about local biota; the absence of adequate teaching materials; curriculum geared towards preparing students for national tests; excess of curricular content; and valuation of a macro/general view of biodiversity concepts rather than a native/local view. The implications of our results are important for the training of biology teachers, to improve initial and continued teacher education programmes about native biodiversity.

AB Even though genetics has been implemented in biology curricula at secondary schools for decades, reports repeatedly indicate that students still hold various misconceptions about this topic. To successfully target these misconceptions, we need to know their nature and origin. We aimed to investigate these properties in the Czech educational system among students of lower-secondary education (ISCED 2) and upper secondary education (ISCED 3). Students underwent a test focused on the basic concepts of genetics based on the content of the national curriculum and current textbooks. The results showed that students have general ideas about the nature of genetic information but struggle to synthetise this knowledge into a deeper understanding of functions in the living body. In many cases, these findings resulted in an increase of various misconceptions. Compared with data about the Czech educational environment and its properties, these problems are caused by a disconnection between the rules of inheritance and functions and impacts of DNA (trait development) on multiple levels of biological organisation both in the national curriculum and textbooks. Therefore, in order to prevent misconceptions, we should focus not only on the way lesson are conducted but also on the changes of national educational policies in the Czech Republic.

AB For conservation biologists to be effective, they need to be able to communicate to the general public. In today's world, communicating means tapping into social media platforms. To get our final-year undergraduate students to engage with using social media as a communication tool, we had each of them create a video, blog, or podcast about a conservation issue they were passionate about. We provided guidance throughout the process but used self-regulated learning as our framework to get the students to engage with the learning process. We further expanded on this by having the students peer-mark 20 of their classmates' projects. This achieved three outcomes, 1) they critically assessed content, 2) it exposed them to topics not covered in class, and 3) they could compare their achievements with those of their peers. To measure our success, we conducted an anonymous survey at the end of the course. Student feedback was very positive with creative freedom, peer-marking, and exposure to science communication being frequent responses. Ultimately, the project achieved our educational goals of fostering self-regulated learning and exposing the students to 21(st) century skills (e.g. critical thinking, creativity, communication, ICT skills) that they would likely use in their future careers.

TI Designing a curriculum for the networked knowledge facet of systems
   thinking in secondary biology courses: a pragmatic framework
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Secondary education; systems thinking; mechanistic reasoning; curricular
   design
AB Systems thinking is a powerful concept in biology which can help students understand how the diversity of contexts in the biology curriculum all have similar underlying characteristics. However, it is not currently a common feature in secondary education as it is not part of the National Curriculum of England. Research on systems thinking has suggested that students struggle with systems thinking in secondary school biology but there is little consensus on how systems thinking can be implemented in schools. Most research focuses on developing pedagogical activities that function as stand-alone units. In this article I complement this work by suggesting that systems thinking needs to be an integrated component of the entire biology curriculum and I offer a simple framework for analysing the extent of systems thinking in curricula, assessments, and student thinking. The intention is that with the creation of pragmatic frameworks and simple pedagogy for systems thinking, the latter will become more prevalent in secondary school biology curricula.

AB Children's ideas, which differ from a scientific view, are termed as alternative conceptions (AC). AC are extremely resistant to change and arise from everyday experience. Investigation of children's AC about weight gain and their ability to discriminate between healthy and unhealthy foods is important, because it can help teachers reduce obesity amongst children. We investigated these issues in a sample of kindergarten and primary school children in Slovakia. More AC about weight gain were found in primary school children, despite the fact that their abilities to discriminate between healthy and unhealthy foods were more sophisticated than the abilities of kindergarten children. These differences were not influenced by gender and what is important, primary school children more frequently correctly noticed that the amount of food, not the food quality itself, impacts the occurrence of obesity in humans compared with kindergarten children. We also found that children's perceptions of obese people are negative and unrelated to children's age or AC about weight gain and the ability to discriminate food. These results suggest that both alternative conceptions about weight gain and children's perception of obese people are unrelated to age, gender and abilities to discriminate between healthy and unhealthy food.

AB Context-based learning has been a highly preferred approach in science education in recent years. However, it can be seen that context-based learning has been neglected in environmental education. This study provides clues as to how the context-based learning approach is used in environmental education. It also shows that environmental measurement devices can be used in context-based learning in order to educate prospective science teachers. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a context-based learning approach, based on environmental measurement devices, on prospective science teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and their environmental literacy. Fifty-four Turkish prospective science teachers participated in the study. As a result of the research, it has been determined that the context-based learning approach has a positive effect on the environmental education self-efficacy beliefs of prospective science teachers, and their environmental literacies. The qualitative data showed that the prospective science teachers' knowledge about environmental problems increased. In addition, positive developments were observed with regard to belief in the self-efficacy of the prospective teachers in terms of environmental education. The results suggest that context-based learning, supported by environmental measurement devices, can be effectively utilised as a framework in courses or extracurricular modules for environmental education.

AB Knowledge about plant nutrition and photosynthesis is key to the scientific literacy of citizens. However, numerous studies have shown the existence of about 50 alternative ideas related to this content. In this work, carried out based on a reflection-action process, two studies based on the ideas of our 12-18 year old students are presented, as well as those of the Teacher Training Master of the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain); we propose a new approach to teach these topics and others related. In addition, the most interesting ideas from an analysis on some of the main university manuals of Plant Physiology on the subject of photosynthesis are shown to finally propose a teaching model of this content that has been applied and evaluated in two Educational Centres of the Community of Madrid, getting good results.

AB Exams constitute the predominant form of summative assessment in undergraduate biology education, with the assumption that exam performance should reflect student conceptual understanding. Previous work highlights multiple examples in which students can answer exam problems correctly without the corresponding conceptual understanding. This disconnect can significantly undermine instructors' ability to interpret exam performance in relation to student learning. Here, we investigate problem-solving strategies used by undergraduate students in biological sciences. Participants were interviewed using a semi-structured protocol: They were asked to solve genetics problems, in multiple-choice and short-answer formats, and were prompted to explain their strategies. Data analysis took a grounded-theory approach and involved iterative close reading of the interview transcripts to examine students problem-solving strategies. Three case studies of participants with similar overall exam performance are presented to explore the variety of strategies. We identified two non-conceptual strategies based on algorithms or patterns within the exam problems. In contrast, the third case-study participant used mostly conceptual strategies grounded in an understanding of biology. We also observed participants switching between conceptual and non-conceptual strategies. These results identify different strategies that undergraduate students use to solve problems in biological sciences, and potential implications on the design of exams and assessments are discussed.

AB A number of areas of difficulty in basic numeracy and mathematical skills were identified, which hinder students' success in a foundational biochemistry course. Many students have difficulty with the concepts of pH and buffers (requiring proficiency with logarithms) and enzyme kinetics (requiring algebraic manipulations and graphing). The voluntary use by students of an 'in house' online support site, the Maths Skills Site, to address these difficulties was varied and seemed to be motivated by assessment deadlines, as well as deliberate instructions to refer to the relevant Maths Skills Site modules when completing assessment. The majority of the users of the online support site were those who performed poorly on a diagnostic test administered at the beginning of the course. There was a small but significant effect of Maths Support Site usage with users achieving improved grades for graphing functions compared to non-users. The combination of mathematical backgrounds and prior academic performance also correlated with success in first-year university biochemistry.

ID ENERGY
AB This research aims to analyse the progression of 13-14 year-old students' ideas regarding the concept of energy transfer by means of heat in three biological mechanisms of thermal regulation. The outputs of 270 students, grouped in 77 cooperative groups, are analysed by comparing their explanations before and after conducting an experimental laboratory workshop in which they investigate the topic of energy transfer by means of heat. Students' explanations are analysed by identifying them in a "conceptual landscape" This landscape shows the conceptual frontiers that students must overcome to move from initial ideas to more sophisticated ones. Thus, while at the beginning of the workshop many students explain the thermal regulation mechanisms using the concept of the flow of coldness and give the morphological and behavioural mechanism the ability to generate heat, most students end up conceptualising the studied mechanisms in terms of the heat transfer regulating function from the warm living beings to the cold environment. Although the latter conceptualisation corresponds to an idea that is not the most sophisticated way of describing the transfer of energy through heat, it constitutes a first step in students' concept development towards ideas closer to those that are scientifically accepted.

ID PERCEPTION; FIELDWORK; SCIENCE
AB We evaluated an emerging smartphone application, iNaturalist, to increase taxonomic identification and engage first-year undergraduate biology majors in outdoor laboratories of aquatic ecosystems (stream and lake ecology) and terrestrial ecosystems (tree and leaf litter ecology). Labs involved identifying organisms using both standard field guides and keys, and comparing taxonomic identifications using the iNaturalist smartphone application derived from student images of organisms. Students were given post-laboratory surveys which assessed their preference for this increasingly popular smartphone application, whether they were more likely to use the application in the future and rate its ability and ease of use to properly identify organisms compared to traditional keys/field guides. This iNaturalist application worked most consistently for students with terrestrial organisms, when images were of sufficient quality. However, when only medium-high to high-quality photos were used, iNaturalist identifications ranged from 92.3% to 97.3% proper biological taxonomic classifications to standard organismal levels for an introductory biology course. Overall, iNaturalist provided greater taxonomic resolution with proper scientific and common names and additional natural history information for many organisms, piquing student interest. Incorporating this smartphone technology may increase identification of local biodiversity and student engagement in the biological sciences.

AB Background: Recent studies shows lack of knowledge concerning health literacy relatively microorganism/disease and the correct use of antibiotics. These facts lead to the spreading of resistant strains bacteria. Aims: The overarching goals of this study were a) to promote health literacy predominantly in respect to microorganism/disease, diseases transmission, antibiotic target and adequate antibiotic use; b) to show the importance of the transmission of health information in different environments; c) to motivate students for science research. Methods: Students' knowledge was evaluated with a survey instrument. Responses were analyzed before and after the implementation of the activity. The activity consists of an interactive lecture, slide show presentation and some practical activities. The sample includes 25 Portuguese students, 13-17 years old who attended the activity in Palacio de Cristal (Porto) and 66 students from D. Maria II School, V.N. Famalicao. Results: In this study, significant increase in knowledge about all the topics evaluated were observed both in formal and informal environments between the pre and post-test; however the best results were detected in informal contexts. Conclusion: The findings showed the importance of the implementation of scientific activities to middle-school students. This experience was valuable and helped to improve student knowledge on heath topics.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of community-based socioscientific issue programmes (SSI-COMM) regarding the issue of abandoned animals on promoting middle school students' understanding of the issue and their character and values as citizens. An SSI-COMM program, called 'Save Abandoned Pets! (SAP),' was implemented in four middle schools located in Seoul; 172 seventh graders voluntarily participated in the programme over eight weeks. Data were collected by observation with detailed field-notes, two questionnaires, and individual interviews with the participating students, instructors and teachers, and local experts. Results indicated that there was a statistically significant increase in their understanding of the abandoned animal issue (QU-SSI) and character and values as citizens (CVGCA) after implementing SSI-COMM. Qualitative data analysis also revealed that the SAP programme prompted the students to consider the healthy relationship between human beings and animals, how badly our behaviours could threaten animals or destroy their well-being, and what kinds of efforts we could make for humans and animals to live together. Ultimately, the students felt sympathy and empathy for the abandoned animals and responsibility to take care of them by participating in the SAP programme.

AB The present study investigated the effects of an online learning environment supported with worked examples and peer feedback on students' argumentative essay writing and domain-specific knowledge acquisition in the field of biotechnology. As part of a bigger project, a pre- and post-test study design was used with 45 bachelor students who were randomly grouped in pairs. Students were asked to analyse a case and write an argumentative essay taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of genetically modified organisms. The results showed that the combination of worked examples and peer feedback improve the quality of argumentative essay writing and facilitate the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge. Implications, suggestions, and future research are discussed.

ID CONCEPTIONS
AB The purpose of this study was to examine if teachers who participated in a continuous professional development (CPD) programme were able to develop an understanding of inquiry-based science education (IBSE). The CPD programme was designed to IBSE in both formal and informal, Learning Outside the Classroom (LOtC) contexts, to discuss its role as a tool to improve pedagogic practises in science teaching and to explore the application of the method in teaching biodiversity and climate change. A qualitative design using pre- and post-programme questionnaires was used to investigate teachers' understanding and classroom implementation of inquiry. Evolution of teachers' practises were also evaluated during the different steps of CPD course and served as a checking and a remind of what is really an authentic scientific inquiry. The results of two-year independent courses suggest that the CPD programme appeared beneficial in resolving teaching misconceptions about IBSE. Teachers were able to experience, evaluate and reflect on their own practise. At the end, they developed new approaches to apply scientific inquiry while teaching biodiversity and climate change in the context of their own classrooms.

ID STUDENTS LEARN; CARD GAME; GENERATION; SCHOOL
AB Most beginners are introduced to plant diversity through identification keys, which develop differentiation skills but not species memorisation. We propose that mnemonics, memorable name clues' linking a species name with morphological characters, are a complementary learning tool for promoting species memorisation. In the first of two experiments, 64 adults in a group-learning environment were taught species identification using mnemonics, an educational card game and a text-based dichotomous key. In the second experiment, 43 adults in a self-directed learning environment were taught species identification using mnemonics and a pictorial dichotomous key. In both experiments, mnemonics produced the highest retention rates of species identification based on vegetative characters. The educational value of these findings is discussed for vegetative plant identification and broader applications.

AB The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate prospective biology teachers' conceptions of teaching biology and identify how these conceptions revealed their strategies for helping their future students' learning of biology. The study utilized drawings, narratives and interviews to investigate the nature of the prospective biology teachers' conceptions in a secondary science teacher education programme, in a university located in the south-west of the USA. Data analysis revealed that three conceptions of teaching biology were common among the participants: (1) teaching biology is an interactive process; (2) teaching biology is a lecture-based process; and (3) learning biology is a visual process. A common theme that underpinned the three conceptions was the simple perspective of using lectures, apparatus and models within interactive processes and lectures as reference points to help students to attach onto biology concepts rather than relating the reference points to prior knowledge and to cognitive activities that foster optimal learning.

AB One of the most serious problems facing our planet is the biodiversity crisis. As a solution to this problem, both scientists and educators have emphasised the need for educating people about how to conserve the Earth's biodiversity. As a small contribution to this effort, we have designed a learning unit about biodiversity, Nature in a world of change, which has recently been implemented with 74 12th-grade Israeli high-school biology students. This unit consists of two components: an introductory module and a collection of three articles adapted from the primary scientific literature. This paper focuses on an in-depth examination with 25 students participating in the programme's implementation. The evaluation process includes a self-assessment of prior basic ecological knowledge and a post-test focusing on concepts and issues central to the understanding of biodiversity, such as niche and Simpson's Index. Analysis of perturbations in a food web (by an invasive species) was a special focus of the assessments, reflecting similar concerns prevalent among the scientific community. The results of this evaluation revealed that students with a solid ecological background could successfully deal with the newly acquired concepts presented in the module and the articles.

AB The 'Green Classroom' in Ulm is an experiential learning forum outside school. Its educational concept is based on experimental learning and is geared towards expanding biological knowledge and developing environmental attitudes regarding preservation and utilisation of nature.
   We assessed the environmental attitude of 92 students before and after they visited the 'Green Classroom', and compared the answers they gave in their questionnaires with those of 100 students from a-control group. Although the students spent only one morning in the 'Green Classroom', attitudes towards utilization of nature improved after their visit but not towards preservation of nature. Moreover, students displayed greater intrinsic motivation towards learning about the animals than the control group.

ID ACQUISITION
AB Student knowledge about plants is typically less than student knowledge about animals. Textbooks are a commonly-used curriculum material in elementary grades and contain embedded cultural ideologies that may impact instruction. This study analyzed two nationally-syndicated elementary science textbook series to explore their presentation of plant and animal content. The results indicated that the amount of animal content was greater than plant content in each series. An even greater difference was found in the number of plant and animal examples used within the textbooks. There were more than twice as many animal examples as plant examples in both textbook series, and the most repeated animal examples were more likely to correspond to scientifically-appropriate classification categories. The study also identified differences in the plant and animal topics covered in the textbooks; the topic of plant parts was the plant topic with the highest coverage in each textbook series; while for animals, the topics of animal needs, adaptations and-types had the highest coverage depending on the textbook series. This study suggests there may be an ideology favoring animals within these elementary science textbooks and that teachers need to supplement their instruction with additional plant information to facilitate student learning about plants.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) exposes an entire class of students to scientific research and is thought to increase students' knowledge retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. Microbial engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that combines science and engineering. We transformed a microbial engineering course into a CURE-type course by adopting an interest-oriented case teaching approach. Based on an investigation of the interest of students, which showed that the topics related to food and health were students' favourites, we selected beer brewing, glutamate fermentation and Monascus cultivation as teaching topics. To simulate the reality of industrial fermentation, pilot-scale fermentation equipment was selected and installed. The course focused on fermentation research; most of the time was spent on performing experiments, and theoretical lectures were held at the intervals. To complete the course in 10 days, three series of experiments were alternatively carried out, and students took turns to conduct fermentation control and process analyses in groups. A questionnaire survey showed that students were satisfied with the CURE-type course, their fermentation knowledge and engineering skills were improved, their research abilities were developed, and their scientific attitudes were cultivated. CURE-type courses are worth popularising in biology teaching.

TI Application and exploration of blended learning with BOPPPS teaching

DE Veterinary infectious disease; BOPPPS teaching model; internet plus
   education; blended learning
AB To explore and explain teaching and learnign issues in a current veterinary infectious disease course, the author proposed the concept of blended learning with a BOPPPS (bridge-in, objective, pre-test, participation learning, post-test, and summary) teaching model (BL-BOPPPS) based on the background of 'Internet plus education'. The study put blended learning (including 'flipped classroom' and the application of 'Rain Classroom' and 'presentation-assimilation-discussion (PAD)') combined with the BOPPPS online and offline model into practice and summarised the teaching effects and reflections that strengthened participatory learning and students' independent learning, thinking and innovation skills, in order to develop them as lifelong learners. This study also aims to provide a new theoretical basis and reference for teaching reform of veterinary infectious disease.

   EXPERIENCES; STUDENTS
AB Despite the growing awareness of the importance of plant secondary metabolites in insect-plant interactions, undergraduate degree content in agronomy and biology generally does not provide a clear concept to students in relation to secondary metabolite induction of plant defences, implying that students do not obtain a good understanding of the secondary metabolism or its functions. To address this deficiency, we have designed a practical exercise where students determine the phytochemical induction of secondary metabolites in aromatic plants subjected to herbivory. This approach involves an experimental laboratory class in which students evaluate the phenolic compounds and main essential oil compound induction in peppermint damaged by an armyworm. By the end of this exercise, based on the results and findings, students will: have a better comprehension of plant defence responses to herbivores; be able to illustrate the consequences of insect herbivory in relation to plant secondary metabolites induction; acquire lab skills related to the use of a spectrophotometer; be able to understand and analyse a GC chromatogram report. Authentic research experiences in the classroom are considered valuable elements for promoting science at undergraduate level, as well as providing motivation for the student and linking research with teaching.

AB Students must develop higher order cognitive skills (HOCS) that allow them to think critically and use their learning in novel situations. However, little is known about how including HOCS in teaching and assessment affects students' perception of learning. We combine quantitative and qualitative data to determine whether the inclusion of HOCS and the presence of constructive alignment influences students' perceptions of learning within the first-year practical components of an undergraduate biology degree at a UK research intensive university. We applied the Blooming Biology Tool (BBT) and Bloom's Dichotomous Key (BDK) to quantify the proportion of HOCS present during practical sessions and their related assessments and found that a combination of tools can be used to reliably assess the requisite cognitive skills required to complete tasks. Students completed an online survey and provided free-text responses regarding which practical sessions they perceived had the most beneficial effects on their learning. Students valued both LOCS and HOCS for their learning but could only recognise and value HOCS in practical sessions featuring high proportions of HOCS. Our research provides methods for assessing and improving constructive alignment in the teaching of biology and furthers our understanding of when students will recognise and value HOCS.

AB The method for producing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was first published in 1975. MAbs have revolutionised research, diagnosis, and disease treatment approaches. While students need a good understanding of MAb production, teaching the key steps via traditional methods can be challenging. Numerous resources exist, but these focus on hybridoma selection omitting other key steps. In 2016, an interactive simulation was developed where students produced a virtual MAb. The simulation was used in conjunction with a lecture and tutorial, providing an alternate approach for students to learn and test their understanding. The simulation is interactive, placing students in charge of all key decisions, with immediate feedback provided at all stages. The impact of the simulation on student learning was assessed between 2017-19. Ten formative multiple-choice questions were included so students could test their understanding. The impact of the simulation on student performance was assessed in a quiz. Students that used the simulation consistently scored significantly higher in all assessment items than students who did not access the simulation. Students were engaged and the positive feedback indicated that they enjoyed this novel, alternative teaching method. This demonstrates that a simulation is a novel, learning aid for teaching students all aspects of MAb production.

DE Biomimicry; biomimetic; inquiry-based learning; environmental literacy
AB Biomimicry is a useful method to develop students' skills, such as design and systems thinking, particularly when complemented with inquiry-based learning. The research seeks to uncover how students engage in the biomimicry process and what types of designs they produce to reveal insights that could assist educators in teaching biomimicry. A study was conducted with 70 undergraduate students who were placed into 12 groups. Using an inquiry-based learning method, students selected their own health challenge and proposed a biomimetic design. Students submitted reports which were analysed via thematic analysis revealing numerous findings, including two common forms of biomimicry carried out by students, further insights into the strategy of 'cross breed mimicry', the types of organisms students imitated, and the successes and difficulties students faced in applying biomimicry. It contributes to the understanding of how students engage in biomimicry. This research is among one of the first studies to apply an existing six stage biomimicry process and to test this in the field of biomedical engineering.

AB The detailed analysis and scoring of concept maps may not be necessary in order for students to gain from their use in the classroom. A simplified recognition of different types ('species') of map may increase the likelihood of teachers employing maps in their classrooms so that more teachers and students might benefit from concept mapping on a regular basis. A greater familiarity and level of engagement with concept maps is likely to support an increase in the level of mapping expertise developed by both teachers and students, enabling maps to be used to support higher order thinking skills - as intended. The counter-intuitive conclusion to this prospect is that the adoption of a non-analytical consideration of maps may actually make them a more valuable classroom asset. However, this requires a greater level of expertise in the application of concept maps on the part of the teacher. A simplified typology of 'map species' is presented to support the development of this perspective.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of authentically based instruction using the 5E model as the structure for lesson delivery on student emotions and the extent to which the students perceived that the teacher was facilitating mastery goals. Participants were 241 sophomore and junior biology students in three urban high schools in a large city in the Midsouth region of the United States. Two conditions occurred: a lesson designed using authentic 5E model, while the other was a text-based lesson on the topic of photosynthesis. The results suggest that the authentic 5E instruction increased interest and enjoyment and decreased anxiety, hopelessness, frustration, confusion, and boredom as compared to the text-based instruction. Furthermore, the students in the authentic group perceived that the teacher facilitated more mastery goals than the comparison group. Finally, we found that the change of student perception in teacher mastery had a predictive relationship with change in positive and negative emotions. Implications of this study are that authentic instruction can lead to positive academic outcomes and that perceived teacher mastery can have a positive influence on student emotions, which in turn can generate motivation and achievement in high school science courses.

AB This study examines the drawings that 178 young children carried out on two different occasions separated by a period of one year to explain their understanding of the plant world. The pictorial content of the drawings was analysed in accordance to the categories that previous research has proved to be useful when it comes to gaining an insight into the examination of the depictions regarding flora in early childhood. The study provides evidence with respect to the changes in the pictorial content occurring in the whole of the sample as well as the four age groups or cohorts involved in the research project. The conclusions are discussed in the light of the evidence that preceding studies offer on the issue of graphical expression about botanical topics in early childhood and lend weight to the importance that early educational interventions have so as to improve young children?s understanding of plan life.

AB While computational biology and bioinformatics became an inherent part of most life science degrees, it remains challenging to encourage students to employ these diverse skills in a practical research context. In this education paper, we present a method to enable students to acquire hands-on skills by the data-driven study of complex biomolecular datasets. The course starts with a series of introductory lectures, including a practical session on Cytoscape and associated computational network biology techniques. As we believe that enabling students to work on their own research questions will increase their motivation and interest, we introduced a recent hallmark virus-host protein-protein interaction article from which the database served as a starting point for the students to develop their research goal, which was presented and discussed in a first informal meeting. Over the next two months, about four interactive sessions were held, where students presented their problems, progress and challenges and exchanged ideas to help each other reach their goals. The role of the lecturers was to assist the students with independently collecting data and exploring new software tools for their research question. We present this concept and methods, and we share our experiences from an evaluation of the student learning outcomes.

AB Though argumentation is a key component of scientific knowledge construction practices, it rarely occurs in classrooms worldwide. Moreover, related literature in the context of genetics and evolution learning primarily addresses them separately. In contrast, this paper is part of broader research on genetics and evolution instruction taught together through scientific practices. We focused on students' arguments and data use while working on a task that required developing explanatory links between sickle cell disease and malaria. Two research questions were framed: What is the nature of students' arguments while explaining these links? What data do they mobilise and how do they use them to support their arguments? Our qualitative approach followed discourse analysis methods. To assess the quality of arguments, theoretical and empirical criteria were used, including the justifications and causal language in the arguments as well as theoretical considerations of genetics and evolution knowledge. The analysis of the second question focused on data use and their sources. The results pointed to students' difficulties in building quality arguments using clear causal language, and to use of genetics and evolution notions in their conclusions. We suggest implications regarding how to address processes occurring on different time scales in combined genetics and evolution instruction.

AB The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study was to investigate elementary student teachers' conceptions of teaching life science outdoors. The study involved 99 student teachers who were enrolled in an elementary science methods course at a large public university in the United States of America. The study utilised drawings, and narratives to investigate the nature of these teachers' conceptions. Data analysis revealed that three conceptions of teaching life science were common among the participants: (1) teaching life science is predominantly conceptualised as being situated in the schoolyard, (2) teaching life science outdoors is teacher-directed, and (3) teaching life science outdoors is disconnected from in-class science instruction. Implications include the need for (1) teacher education programmes to provide reflective supports that explicate student teachers' conceptualisation of teaching life science and thus exposing prior frameworks; and (2) teacher educators to examine student teachers' prior frameworks for teaching life science outdoors and provide knowledgeable theory and practice platforms that will serve as frameworks for student teachers to adopt, connect and routinize outdoor life science teaching with in-school teaching of life science.

AB Contemporary research suggests an urgent need for educators to improve the quality of STEM teaching and learning. We developed a semester-long model curriculum for STEM teaching and learning. The overarching goal of this study was to establish an authentic inquiry approach to advanced laboratory courses that is interdisciplinary, collaborative, and utilizes algorithm-generated student grouping strategies. We assessed the effects of the model curriculum on student understanding of scientific concepts and processes, perceptions of their learning, and attitudes toward science and research. Students in a biology laboratory course collaborated with students in biochemistry and mathematics courses. The differences between pre- and post-Participant Perception Indicator (PPI) survey responses (relative to the baseline semester) indicated that, when paired with similarly-performing students, higher-performing students are more likely to report improvements in understanding, skills, integration of learning, and meeting learning objectives. Mid-level performing students report significant improvements in understanding, attitudes, integration of learning, and meeting learning objectives. Lower-level performing students report regressions. Performance quiz data reveal improvements in understanding of scientific concepts following the implementation of our model curriculum. Our findings warrant future studies on the relationships among grouping, student perceptions, and academic performance.

AB Decision-making in socioscientific issues (SSI) constitutes a real challenge for both biology teachers and learners. The assessment of students' performances in SSIs constitutes a problem, especially for biology teachers. The study at hand was conducted in Germany and uses a qualitative approach following the research procedures of grounded theory to focus on teachers' concepts and, especially, coping strategies in assessment concerning students' decision-making in SSIs. Semi-structured interviews with six teachers, in combination with video-vignettes, were used for data generation. The results show predominantly defensive strategies when teachers are confronted with the assessment of students' performances in SSIs. These results and implications for teacher education and teacher training are discussed.

AB Obesity is a critical global public health issue. It leads to numerous health conditions that limit the quality and length of life, placing a huge burden on healthcare systems around the world. Scholars believe that the fight against obesity can be won only through multidisciplinary efforts. However, the literature on people's understanding of obesity is limited, perhaps because this topic does not attract the attention of educators at the appropriate level. Although existing studies show that people lack understanding about the mechanisms of obesity, most of the arguments in these papers suffer from a lack of theoretical background and methodological problems. Therefore, we conceived the present study based on a sound theory (conceptual change) in order to understand school students' conceptual patterns regarding weight gain, which is an important component of obesity knowledge. A written questionnaire probing the mechanism of weight gain was distributed to 151 secondary school students in the Turkish part of Cyprus. Content analysis was applied to students' compositions. The results showed that students have six major conceptual patterns about weight gain. They also hold a range of misconceptions and misunderstandings, and sometimes have no conceptions. At the end of the paper, we discuss possible curricular and teaching implications based on the patterns and incorrect knowledge structures.

AB This study examines to what extent elementary students use feedback loop reasoning, a key component of systems thinking, to reason about interactions among organisms in ecosystems. We conducted clinical interviews with 44 elementary students (1st through 4th grades). We asked students to explain how populations change in two contexts: a sustainable ecosystem and an ecosystem that is missing predators. We used an iterative process to develop a learning progression for feedback loop reasoning, and used the learning progression to code interview episodes. The study produces three findings. First, very few students recognised the cyclical relationships among populations in a sustainable ecosystem (Level 7). Second, very few students identified both reproduction and food as the factors affecting population in a context missing predators (Level 4). Finally, students' reasoning was inconsistent across the two contexts. We also discuss the implication of these findings for teaching and learning of food webs at elementary school.

AB Practical skills are important for the employability of biosciences graduates; however, first year science undergraduates often struggle to adapt to university practical classes, affecting skills development and decreasing their enthusiasm for laboratory work. This study describes the effects of introducing online multimedia practical support resources on biochemistry and biological sciences on first year student performance, and investigates student usage and student opinion of the value of these resources. In total, 391 students used these resources over a three-period. Information was collated on their completion of preparation tasks and module performance. Student opinion was sought using questionnaires with opportunity for free comment. Engagement with preparation tasks affected student performance in practical modules. Student's t-tests showed a significant difference between the performances of highly engaged, engaged and poorly engaged students, with higher engagement leading to improved performance. Student opinion was sought twice, in 2010-11 and 2012-13. Resources were well used, and students found the resources helpful in understanding the theoretical basis of practical work and how to undertake experiments; they enjoyed practical classes and felt that the preparation resources increased their confidence.

AB The aim of this learning exercise was to harness current interest in zombies in order to educate audiences about the epidemiology of infectious disease. Participants in the activity were provided with an outbreak scenario, which they then used as the basis of play-based activities. By considering the mode and speed of transmission, size of outbreak and prevention/control strategy, participant groups were able to define parameters of their outbreak scenario. These were then input to SimZombie, a computer simulation program developed by the authors, which visually demonstrated the spread of infection through a population. The resulting animations were then used as the basis of in-depth discussion which, in turn, enabled the consideration of principles of disease transmission and control strategies. The activity provided an opportunity to engage a range of audiences through a variety of different delivery mechanisms, including role play, workshops and informal drop-in. Learning was evidenced by participation and feedback.

   literacy
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE scientific literacy; biology classroom; discourse analysis; evolution;
   curriculum emphasis; intertextuality
AB This paper explores affordances in teaching evolution, especially those in which evolution is made relevant to and argued for in a grade 9 biology classroom, thus giving potential answers to the pupils' legitimate question, why am I learning evolution?' The aim of the paper is methodological in the sense that it explores whether the notions subject focus, curriculum emphasis and intertextuality have potential as analytical tools and pointers towards enacted scientific literacy in classroom practice. The notion of subject focus (either induction into science or learning from science) and the seven curriculum emphases (correct explanation, structure of science, scientific skill development, solid foundation, everyday coping, decision making and self as explainer) are predefined and used abductively on the data set. Intertextuality is analysed more inductively: references that pupils and teacher make are sought and these intertextual links are then sorted into clusters. The findings indicate that the structuring tools have potential as descriptors in the analysis. One subject focus (induction into science) and a few curriculum emphases (especially correct explanations) are privileged, while others, eg everyday coping, are not. When the discourses of self as explainer and correct explanations compete, it is the latter that is privileged.

ID ANIMATION
AB This study investigated the effectiveness of three different instructional materials for learning how to identify fish at the species level in a blended classroom and out-of-classroom scenario. A sample of 195 first-year students of biology or geoecology at the University of Tuebingen participated in a course on identification of European freshwater fish species at a public aquarium. Prior to studying the species in the aquarium's fish tanks, students prepared themselves in a classroom nearby with one of three different learning materials: (1) preserved specimens and paper-based dichotomous identification keys; (2) digital videos; or (3) digital videos with preserved specimens and paper-based dichotomous identification keys. Students' acquisition of knowledge and their motivation were measured twice, once after preparing in the classroom and once after visiting the aquarium. Results showed that students who had prepared themselves with digital videos identified significantly more species correctly but were less motivated than those students who had learnt only with preserved specimens and dichotomous identification keys. When both instructional methods were combined students performed well in the post-tests and were motivated to learn, suggesting that the combination of both instructional approaches encourages motivation without any outcome losses.

ID MODEL
AB In the present study, the understandings of student teachers (training for the primary phase and Master's degree students from a primary science and technology education department) about flowers and plant cells using the method of drawing in combination with interviews are explored. The data were gathered from 116 student teachers and 10 Master's degree students training for the primary phase from Turkey. The sample was selected due to one of the researchers being a member of staff in this faculty. A qualitative approach was adopted. A measuring instrument consisting of 10 open-ended questions was prepared and given to the students. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 20 student teachers and six Master's students; these students were randomly selected from the total sample. In our study we found that they were simply copying internet or book diagrams instead of drawing their own diagrams. We conclude that it may be helpful to train student teachers in the processes of contsructing and reading diagrams.

AB Field experiments are at the core of ecology, yet rarely find their way into education, probably due to a combination of technical challenges and risks associated with fieldwork. This may compromise student education and perception of the subject, making interesting, readily manageable experiments extremely important. We describe how the daily cycle of nocturnal mass movements by river invertebrates ('drift') can meet these challenges. The observation of this daily cycle, and simple manipulations using light (to test hypotheses about the triggers for drift) and fine sand (simulating degradation of stream habitats), requires minimal specialist equipment or expertise, yet affords numerous practical benefits and captures student interest through the novel fieldwork. Invertebrate drift illustrates numerous biological principles through investigations adjusted to suit different educational levels.

AB In March 1999, a ca. 45 m tall construction crane was installed in a highly diverse, mature temperate forest near the village of Hofstetten, south of Basel (Swiss Canopy Crane project, Switzerland). The crane provides access to the canopy using a gondola for in situ research. With a new type of FACE technique (Free Air CO(2) Enrichment), selected trees have been exposed for several years to a CO(2) - enriched atmosphere (540 ppm), simulating the expected ambient concentration of ca. 2060. Using the results of the Swiss Canopy Crane project (photosynthesis and tree growth under elevated carbon dioxide) and with regard to typical students' conceptions about the carbon cycle, we developed a teaching strategy to clarify the flux of carbon in trees. Our teaching unit draws attention to processes such as root and soil respiration (e.g. respiration by soil animals), which are central to understanding carbon fluxes but are rarely presented in textbooks. The findings of this study are relevant and very topical because they help students to understand the consequences of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide for carbon flux in plants.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DE heart; model; collaborative learning
AB Understanding biological structures and functions is often difficult because of their complexity and micro-structure. For example, the vascular system is a complex and only partly visible system. Constructing models to better understand biological functions is seen as a suitable learning method. Models function as simplified versions of real objects and concentrate on special features of those to facilitate learning. Because of the complexity of the vascular system, models can be implemented as beneficial teaching aids. Learning with models is also an effective form in combination with collaborative learning.
   This paper introduces three simplified heart and blood vessel models. They were designed for collaborative learning. The models were implemented in a study with 7th grade students (13 years old). Results of a paper-pencil evaluation show that collaboratively learning with models of the heart and the blood vessels was interesting for students. Furthermore, students gained better understanding and achieved higher test scores.

AB This study aims to reveal the effectiveness of documentary-based augmented reality applications in environmental education compared to the direct instruction method supported by the question and answer technique. The research was designed as mixed-method research, and the study group consisted of 118 tenth grade students. T-tests were used to analyse the quantitative data, and descriptive analyses were used to analyse the qualitative data. In the study, it was found that the first source of information for students about environmental problems is school. The quantitative results of the study showed that documentary-based augmented reality applications in environmental education are more effective in relating learned information to daily life. Qualitative results of the study also revealed that this education is more effective in enabling people to contemplate the behavioural consequences of environmental problems. Moreover, it was observed that the students who received this education explored more reasons in their statements about environmental problems.

AB In secondary science education, students often do not feel engaged with the scientific concepts that are taught, which hinders conceptual learning. This lack of engagement can be overcome by fictional placemaking. Therefore, the purpose of our design-based research is to explore how the creation and use of fictional places lead to meaningful contexts providing opportunities for the learning of biology. Four design principles were formulated from theories on: (1) pedagogy of place; (2) communities of practice; (3) imaginative teaching; and (4) story-based learning. Based on these principles a lesson series was designed in which students were challenged to create societies living in domes on Mars as a fictional place. This lesson series was conducted in a ninth-grade class (28 students) at pre-university level. It was evaluated on the contribution of the design principles to create a meaningful context for the learning of biology. This research focuses on causal reasoning, which is a key competency in biology. The analysis of artefacts of group work showed evidence that students expressed different types of causal reasoning. Reflection on each of the design principles made clear how fictional placemaking provides opportunities for the development of students' causal reasoning.

AB Biology doctoral students face a myriad of barriers that may extend or impede their degree completion. These barriers result in a less diverse workforce, considering that institutionalised prejudices have created more barriers to academic success for some groups than others. Here, we aimed to understand the role that non-cognitive and demographic factors play in predicting doctoral students' perceived barriers, and identify which factors best predict personal/psychological, situational, and institutional barriers to degree completion. We surveyed 289 current biology doctoral students in the U.S. We measured grit, sense of belonging, and science identity as well as participants' perceived barriers. We tested the efficacy of non-cognitive factors alone in predicting the three barrier types versus models including demographic factors. We found that both non-cognitive and demographic factors were important in explaining perceived barriers. Higher scores of grit were associated with lower perceived personal/psychological barriers. However, we assert that grittiness is shaped by unique experiences and is highly situational. We do not imply that grit should be used as a main predictor of 'success' in doctoral programs. We suggest future research on what mechanisms facilitate growth of inherently gritty characteristics in biology doctoral students which lead to fewer perceived barriers to degree completion.
   Plain Language SummaryDuring graduate school, biology doctoral students may face barriers that extend or stand in the way of their degree completion. Historically, academia has excluded some groups of people more than others and this has created more barriers to the success of those groups in academia. The result of these barriers can have great effects on the diversity of our workforce where only some groups of people graduate with their degree and go on to work in the field. In this study we aimed to understand the role that personality-type traits (non-cognitive factors) and demographic factors, such as age and race, play in predicting the degree to which doctoral students perceive barriers. Additionally, we aimed to identify which factors best predict personal/psychological, situational, and institutional barriers to degree completion. We surveyed 289 current biology doctoral students in the U.S. and measured participants' perceived barriers, as well as three non-cognitive factors: grit, sense of belonging, and science identity. We tested whether non-cognitive factors alone predict the three barrier types best or if models including demographic factors better predict these barriers. We found that both non-cognitive and demographic factors were important in explaining how biology doctoral students perceive barriers to their success. Further, students with higher grit scores did not see personal/psychological barriers as large barriers to their degree completion. However, grittiness is shaped by unique experiences and can be formed through very specific situations. We do not mean to say that grit should be used as a main predictor of "success" in doctoral programs. We suggest future research on how to best promote growth of naturally gritty characteristics in biology doctoral students which lead to fewer perceived barriers to degree completion.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic had an immense impact on communities around the world. We know that new epidemic-prone diseases will emerge in the future. Consequently, it is important to investigate what impact the current pandemic had on school children's understanding of infectious diseases in order to develop biology education based on that novel understanding. The aim of this study was to explore Swedish middle school (10-12-year-old) pupils' understanding of infectious diseases and their perceived sources of knowledge. Data was collected through individual semi-structured interviews with fifteen pupils and analysed by thematic coding. Results revealed a great impact of the pandemic on the respondents' conceptions. Firstly, their notion of infectious diseases based on their idea of COVID-19 was elusive because COVID-19 can manifest very differently. Secondly, the need to care about oneself and others was recognized. Thirdly, the importance of vaccines was recognized, but vaccines were given different roles. Finally, their understanding of infection seems to originate from informal domains such as the news and the Internet, rather than from biology education. One proposal for biology teaching could be to introduce scientific concepts earlier, to pay more attention to differences and similarities between infectious diseases, and to cooperate with other school subjects.

AB Explanation of natural phenomena at one level of biological organisation almost always involves causes that are found at other levels. Although scientists thinking across levels find it easy to explain physiological phenomena, students often perceive this as a challenge. We developed a new graphic organiser called Zoom Map, which is a mode for structuring biological information along the levels of biological organisation and is designed to guide biology students when they need to consider the levels of organisation. The aim of this study is to examine how Zoom Map helps students explain a common phenomenon in plant physiology: leaves that are upright or wilted. Accordingly, we designed a teaching experiment covering 13 students. During the experiments, the students were videotaped. We used qualitative content analysis to examine the explanations. Our findings indicate that Zoom Map improved students' explanations of the phenomenon across multiple levels of organisation: The students used more levels than before, and they referred to lower levels that were lacking previously. Therefore, it can be concluded that students who use Zoom Map are supported in their ability to explain a biological phenomenon across the levels of biological organisation.

ID PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA STRAINS
AB Research and education are two areas often compartmentalised or separated by an abyss, linked in this study by a service-learning methodology, the Small World Initiative project. The programme instruction starts at the university, reaches secondary school and returns to university to complete the research, challenging young students to discover novel bioactive-producing microorganisms from environmental soil samples. In this study, 13 soil samples were analysed and 260 bacterial isolates were recovered. Ten of them were selected as potential producers of antimicrobial molecules (AP(+)), obtained from six soil samples. Antibiosis tests revealed that three isolates produced antimicrobial molecules, with inhibitory activity against 90% of the tested indicator bacteria, including relevant pathogens. Regarding antibiotic susceptibility, 4 of 10 AP(+) bacterial isolates were susceptible for all tested antibiotics, five were resistant to at least one antibiotic and one showed a multidrug resistance phenotype, showing students the importance of searching for new antimicrobial agents and the risk of antibiotic resistance. To test the impact of the project, satisfaction surveys and knowledge and attitudes questionnaires about microorganisms and antibiotics were carried out, acquiring satisfactory results. Therefore, a connecting loop has been formed between teaching and research, promoting scientific vocations and communicating scientific culture through a focus on antimicrobial resistance.

TI Teacher views of experimentation in ecosystem science
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Ecosystems science; experimentation; epistemologically authentic
   practices; body f evidence approach; teacher knowledge; instructional
   practices
AB Education reform calls for portraying science as a process of inquiry and argumentation grounded in the epistemic traditions of a domain. While experimentation is a core scientific investigation strategy, diverse approaches are represented across different domains of science. Ecosystem scientists use experiments as a core part of their investigations, yet also acknowledge limits to its applicability. They describe experimentation as one approach among investigative strategies - combining these into a 'body of evidence' (BOE) approach that triangulates sources of evidence to support causal claims. A study was conducted to explore how these epistemic assumptions in ecosystems science are understood by K-12 teachers. Ten teachers from across the United States were interviewed. The teachers expressed understandings of experimentation that did not fully align with a BOE approach but displayed knowledge of some approaches used by ecosystem scientists. This knowledge was less apparent in their descriptions of their ecosystems science unit pedagogy and curricula and teachers cited a number of obstacles to incorporating it. The results suggest that if a BOE approach were to be introduced in K-12 ecosystems science, teachers would need a fuller understanding of this perspective and support in overcoming obstacles to employing it in the classroom.

DE Environment; nature connection; empathy; attitudes; aspirations
AB Biology education aims to inspire interest, curiosity, and understanding about the natural world, foster children's interests and orientations towards supporting and protecting nature, and support children towards biology-related careers (including those involving nature and animals). However, it remains less clear how these views might associate with different aspects of education and life. In order to gain new insights, 679 children in England (between 7 and 10 years old) were surveyed. The questionnaire included established measures for views about nature and learning, alongside new areas. The analysis applied predictive modelling to reveal independent associations between the children's views. The children's appreciation of nature and affinities towards animals were two of the strongest positive predictors of their interest in learning about nature, which was the strongest positive predictor of their aspirations towards careers involving nature or animals. Other findings highlighted the importance of nature-related activities and also children's wider educational contexts and views. Watching nature-related media positively predicted children's interest in learning about nature, while reading books about nature or wildlife positively predicted children's aspirations towards careers involving nature or animals. Children's confidence and enjoyment in their schoolwork positively predicted their appreciation of nature and also their interest in learning about nature.

TI Better understanding of ageing research through a 12-week laboratory
   course for undergraduates majoring in biotechnology
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Ageing; drosophila melanogaster; laboratory course; lifespan
AB Human ageing and age-associated diseases are among the greatest challenges and financial burdens faced by developed countries. Unfortunately, undergraduate students often do not experience any laboratory training in ageing research in the current laboratory curriculum of majors in biology, biotechnology, or medicine. In this study, we developed and implemented a 12-week laboratory course for biotechnology undergraduates in which Drosophila melanogaster is used as the model organism to scaffold the understanding of the basic concept and process of ageing research. Students worked in teams of three to conduct lifespan analyses based on the use of selected dietary supplements on Drosophila melanogaster. By integrating abstract knowledge and practice in the process of scientific research, students gained hands-on experience in lab techniques while learning about the principle and process of ageing research. The learning outcomes demonstrated that students substantially enhanced their understanding of how lifespan assays could be used to evaluate whether a certain dietary supplement has an anti-ageing effect. Overall, the course was very effective for helping biotechnology undergraduates learn the theory and application of basic ageing research, while also yielding positive effects in developing confidence and scientific skills for future work in research.

TI How prepared do students feel for the quantitative nature of a
   biological sciences degree?
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Quantitative Biology; preparedness; mathematics; transition
AB Quantitative abilities and techniques are vital in modern biological sciences from lab calculations and classical hypothesis testing to the growth of 'omics' and big data. Long before the employability at Higher Education can be considered, the transition between Secondary and Higher Education must be. Students doing biological sciences degrees at a UK university were surveyed to ascertain the factors that prepared students best for the quantitative nature of a biological sciences degree. Student perceptions of biological sciences as a quantitative subject altered once they began their degree's. Students who studied mathematics post-16 felt more prepared for the quantitative nature of their biological sciences degree while Secondary level biology does not prepare. Post-16 mathematics is only an entry requirement for 1of 49 biological sciences courses across the UK's Russell Group universities. Most students do not feel prepared by their Secondary Education for the quantitative nature of a biological sciences degree and Higher Education Institutions do not ask for quantitative qualifications. This study highlights the lack of preparedness perceived by students and the potential discord in this field between Secondary and Higher Education.

AB This research investigates students' learning about the electron transport chain (ETC) process in photosynthesis by watching a video followed by playing a serious board game -Electron Chute- that models ETC. The learning objectives targeted enriching a mental model that students could use to explain the causal relationship of the ETC common misconceptions students hold. Eighth graders (N = 120) participated in a one-day activity using a video and game designed by the researchers to model ETC. This model explained how sunlight energy was converted into ATP involving a flow of electrons. A quasi-experimental design involved a pre-test/post-test essay where students from the two treatments - video only and video+game - were asked to interpret a diagram about ETC. PlayingElectron Chuteafter watching the video was effective on addressing misconceptions about sunlight absorption by chlorophylls, oxygen, ATP and NADPH production and the electron flow during ETC. A survey collected data about students' experiences after the video+game treatment. The majority of students agreed that playing the game increased their ability to explain how plants use light energy. This study demonstrates a principled approach for designing a video and game to support students' ability to make sense of how complex systems work.

DE Maggots; maggot therapy; antibacterial resistance; wound infection;

ID DISGUST; ANIMALS
AB We conducted a small pilot study examining the opinions of school teachers across five Welsh primary schools on the possibility of introducing grand challenges (such as antibacterial resistance), and concepts to help solve such challenges (such as the use of living maggots to help treat infected wounds) to pupils at a young age. Our questionnaire-based study found that most teachers felt that this was indeed possible, with the majority feeling that pupils in Years 5 and 6 would be the most relevant and best years in which to introduce these concepts. With regards to introducing maggots to children as being positive and beneficial creatures, almost 50% of teachers felt that squeamishness may be present in children of all years, but that disgust and dislike of maggots would exist to a greater degree in older children. Our exploratory results suggest that with further research, this important biological concept could be introduced in the curriculum of primary schools, when perhaps less engrained negative perceptions, and more educated awareness of the positive benefits of using maggots as a treatment for wound infections may be achievable.

AB In this paper, we present a simulation of artificial selection of maize that can be used as a bridging case for the subsequent introduction of natural selection in school. The proposed simulation takes up essential biological elements but also has a cultural meaning for the inhabitants of some regions of Latin America. After implementing a test of the simulation with secondary school teachers, we identified fundamental ideas that are introduced as a result of participating in the simulation: intentionality, recognition of variants, gradual process and population. These ideas are relevant for understanding evolution as natural selection. Therefore, the simulation could be used as a bridging case because it focuses the attention on relevant ideas for artificial selection and leaves aside others that are not productive.

DE Cell migration; cytoskeleton; microtubules; actin filaments;
   inquiry-based learning
AB Cell migration, a fundamental process in development, wound healing, and immune function, is a common topic in undergraduate cell biology courses. We developed laboratory exercises with an inquiry-based learning (IBL) approach in which cell migration could be examined with the scratch assay, adapted from the primary literature. A narrow scratch was created in a confluent monolayer of cells growing on the bottom of a cell culture dish. Migration into the resultant cell-free zone from both sides of the scratch was measured after one day using the scale bar function of a digital camera. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line was used, but any adherent cell type could be examined. Students used the scratch assay to formulate hypotheses and design experiments in which variables affecting cell migration could be investigated. For example, the effect of cytoskeletal disruption was evaluated by adding the microtubule- and microfilament-disrupting drugs, colcemid and phallacidin, respectively, to the growth medium when the scratch was made. Optimal drug concentration parameters were determined for students to reference. Low drug concentrations inhibited cell migration, while higher concentrations killed the cells. This study demonstrated that the scratch assay is an accessible IBL method for studying cell migration.

AB The aim of this study was to design and evaluate an inquiry- and activity-based learning unit for the classroom that uses biological collections to teach key evolutionary concepts and to support the understanding and appreciation of the work of a museum. The unit consisted of three parts that focused on the most important tasks of museums: collecting and conserving, researching and exhibiting. The students created their own collection, performed research surrounding it and then designed an exhibition. Seventy-six secondary sixth- and seventh-grade students participated in the testing of the prototype unit. For evaluation, we carried out a pre-/post-test design using a questionnaire that assessed content knowledge and learning enjoyment. The mean knowledge score of the post-test indicated significant learning gains compared to the pre-test results. The test on learning enjoyment showed best mean values for actions that included the collection, compared to results of the theoretical parts of the unit. This approach demonstrates that the learning unit offers the opportunity to experience the tasks of a museum at first hand and to acquire knowledge about evolutionary science and evolutionary principles.

AB One of the major causes of the problems affecting evolution education is a lack of acceptance of this concept, particularly by some people who have strongly entrenched religious beliefs. This paper reports on a section of a study which explored the influence of the beliefs of learners in some secondary schools from the Vhembe District in the northern Limpopo Province, South Africa, on the teaching and learning of biological evolution. A questionnaire was administered to Grade 12 learners studying life sciences to which 348 responded. Data were analysed to provide descriptive and inferential data for analysis. Findings indicated moderate acceptance of evolution by the learners. Some of the factors which showed an association with learners' acceptance included: learners' religious beliefs, age and the time since they had first heard of evolution. Although some learners experienced conflict between their religious beliefs and evolution, the findings showed that most were willing to learn about it.

AB In this study, we developed an educational programme using soil seed banks to promote ecological literacy among primary school-aged children. The programme consisted of seven student activities, including sampling and setting soil seed banks around the school, watering, identifying seedlings, and making observations about the plants and their environments. Research was conducted in two urban elementary schools in Seoul, Korea with 99 fourth-grade students, who were divided into two experimental groups that engaged in the soil seed bank programme and a control group that followed the official textbook-based curriculum for studying lima bean seed growth. After participating in this programme, the level of student concepts about the relationship between plant distribution and the environment increased significantly in comparison with a control group (p<0.01), as did student knowledge about plants and plant ecology (p<0.01). In addition, the programme was associated with increases in eco-centric attitudes among the students (p<0.01), including a shift toward more positive attitudes about plants. According to the participants, the programme better enabled students to recognise and observe temporal changes in plants and nature, providing one indication that their ecological sensibilities were augmented by the student activities in which they engaged. Both the participating students and the teachers leading the activities expressed a belief that the programme benefited the participating students, and that the activities were interesting and useful. This study showed that a programme of activities using soil seed banks and seedling emergence methods promoted ecological literacy by providing simple, hands-on opportunities to experience and inquire about local plants and their environments.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The consideration of threshold concepts is offered in the context of biological education as a theoretical framework that may have utility in the teaching and learning of biology at all levels. Threshold concepts may provide a mechanism to explain the observed punctuated nature of conceptual change. This perspective raises the profile of periods of conceptual stasis from 'failure to learn' to necessary periods within the normal pattern of student learning. Threshold concepts are seen as points where segmental/linear knowledge structures and cumulative/hierarchical knowledge structures are integrated, resulting in a transformation in understanding. 'Evolution' and `dynamic transformation' are nominated as candidate threshold concepts within biology

AB In this study, preservice science teachers' conceptions of trees, forests and deforestation were explored. Thirty-three preservice science teachers who were enrolled in a compulsory ecology course participated in the study. Two open question forms were used to collect data in class hours. A phenomenographic research methodology was used to analyse preservice science teachers' written responses. Outcome space represented the full range of conceptions held by the participants and the relations identified between these conceptions. Participant responses in one of the class activities, i.e. 'Name the Tree', were also used to conclude if the preservice science teachers recognise the trees that they pass daily. Implications for teacher education are considered accordingly.

TI Investigating student experiences of botanical field work using a

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DT Article; Early Access
DE Botany; virtual fieldwork; ecology; ecological pedagogy; online learning
ID SCIENCE
AB Field teaching is an essential component of botany and ecology; however, field classes were among the most likely to be cancelled during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual alternatives that could be used to meet learning outcomes for botany (e.g. plant identification, surveying skills development) were largely unavailable at this time. To address this, a semi-immersive virtual botanical fieldtrip was developed using H5P. The resource consists of a 360 site tour, an interactive book with a series of interactive videos to mimic quadrat analysis and plant identification, and a plant identification guide to aid students in identifying species. Students responded largely positively to the resource, although they had a clear preference to undertake fieldwork in person in a more traditional manner. The resource is the first such virtual botanical fieldtrip and allows the retention of most learning outcomes for a traditional field class. This type of resource has considerable potential in a post-pandemic world to widen participation and let students experience ecosystems that they might otherwise not have the opportunity to investigate. The resource is available for use under a CC BY-NC-SA licence.

AB Hands-on activities are considered to be particularly suitable for generating long-term knowledge that increases environmentally friendly behaviour. Appropriate flagship species in a respective curricular context can enable high-quality education. We have developed a teaching concept and material for hands-on activities with bumblebees. This includes aspects of outdoor bumblebee-keeping in a teaching unit, together with the identification of bumblebee species and conservation activity in the context of biodiversity; bumblebees can act as umbrella species because their conservation needs incidentally protect other species. Moreover, the project involves keeping bumblebees indoors in a teaching unit that covers ethology and neurobiology. A total sample size of 188 German high school students from the fifth to seventh grade (lower and intermediate secondary-school levels) participated in the project. We measured students' knowledge about bumblebees in general and insect decline, as well as fear of bumblebees in a pre-test, post-test and follow-up test. Learning enjoyment was also measured in the post-test. Students acquired long-lasting knowledge and considerably enjoyed the learning experience. Fear of bumblebees decreased long-term, although knowledge that bumblebees can sting increased.

AB The purpose of the present study was to reveal the effectiveness of the Nature of Science (NOS) embedded in Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) instructional method on pre-service science teachers' (PSTs) content knowledge and self-efficacy in evolution theory. The study was a mixed-method study in which the qualitative data collection and analysis was conducted after the quantitative. In the first part of the study, a pre-post intervention design was used as a part of quasi-experimental study and in the second part, semi-structured interviews were conducted to deepen understanding of the results of the intervention. The participants of study consist of 36 PSTs who attended a public university in the north of Turkey. The findings showed that the NOS embedded in the ADI instructional method was effective for increasing content knowledge and self-efficacy and decreasing misconceptions in evolution. However, there were no differences in PSTs' beliefs with respect to creationist views after intervention.

AB Photosynthesis is the predominant metabolic process for energy obtention in plants. Here we describe a case study where a set of anatomical, biochemical, and molecular characters are used to reconstruct the evolution of the C-4 photosynthetic pathway, within the evolutionary framework provided by the genus Flaveria. Our main educational goal was to engage biology undergraduate students to solve a photosynthesis-related phylogenetic problem by stimulating them to assemble informative characters of diverse nature. This case study was successfully implemented as a seminar in a massive university introductory course, during the COVID19 lockdown. Using an online learning environment, most small groups achieved the Students Learning Outcomes, which were assessed through a questionnaire and an open-ended question. Individual performance was also evaluated through a specific exercise in the course's midterm test. Finally, students were surveyed for their perception about the seminar through a poll. We concluded that this seminar could be easily adopted to promote the learning of complex and interdisciplinary content like the C-4 photosynthetic pathway in undergraduate botanical education, even in a large online introductory course.

AB Cell division is one of the most relevant processes in Biology, for instance, to understand the reproduction of species or the development of tumours. Learning this content requires not addressing it out of context but integrating it into real-life problems that demand students apply their knowledge about cell division. In this study, the authors examine how ten small groups of 10th grade students apply their mitosis models to solve a problem about cancer treatment; and how they progress in their application in terms of students' discursive moves. Throughout their discussions, learners must explain what happens to a treated tumour cell which cannot finish its division. To do so, they should consider understudied ideas such as the prometaphase stage or the importance of bipolar spindle formation. Data collected are the groups' audio recordings and their written reports. The results show that all groups handle notions, such as the need for centrosomes' duplication or microtubules-chromosomes' attachment for mitosis to be complete, throughout the activity. Although all groups integrate two or three ideas at a time into their discourse, none of them manage to combine and contextualise all the expected ones. Implications for Biology education are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Introductory biology; learning; stem; vocabulary
AB Gateway science courses are an ongoing obstacle to recruitment into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, in part due to the large gains in vocabulary that are fundamental to scientific literacy. Students also struggle to achieve the technological literacy necessary for a STEM career. We implemented an ePortfolio-based project in 12 sections of General Biology I (n = 164) at an urban community college. This project was designed to aid students at integrating general biology vocabulary around a central topic - an organism of their choice - while also increasing their facility in using ePortfolio. We assessed the effectiveness of the project using a set of 17 survey questions, 12 of which were also delivered to control sections. Students responded positively to the project, and the project was effective at increasing scientific literacy and understanding of the technological platform. However, the project did not help students make gains in technological literacy. This project demonstrates that integrating general course-specific vocabulary around a central topic may be useful in helping students succeed in gateway STEM courses.

DE Apoptosis; DNA fragmentation; caspase; CHO cells; inquiry-based learning
AB Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a cellular pathway by which individual cells self-destruct for the benefit of the organism. In this practical paper, we describe laboratory exercises with an inquiry-based learning (IBL) approach in which undergraduate students compared apoptosis among different types of cultured cells. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation was used to induce apoptosis in mouse primary cells and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) tumor cells. Students hypothesized that, because tumor cells evade apoptosis, CHO cells would exhibit less apoptosis compared to primary cells. Treated and control cells were labeled for two hallmarks of apoptosis, fragmented DNA and active caspase-3 enzyme, and all nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Cell counts were conducted using fluorescence microscopy. Exposure to UV light induced apoptosis in both cell types compared to controls, but no significant difference in the proportions of labeled cells was observed between UV-treated primary and CHO cells. Optimal parameters for UV exposure and labeling techniques are presented. This exercise provides instructors with methodology for allowing students to use a basic cell culture system and microscopy to formulate a hypothesis and design experiments related to apoptosis. Students incorporated their work into a research paper, which served as the main mode of assessment.

AB Knowledge about research in medical and allied health fields is an integral part of professional development in patient care practice. However, completion of an exclusive research degree is not always feasible for clinicians. In such a scenario, short interactive educational sessions may serve to effectively enhance research knowledge in clinicians. Our study aimed at determining the impact of short, interactive educational sessions on knowledge about quantitative and qualitative research in dietetic professionals. In a pre-post-test single group interventional design, 34 clinical dietitians were pre-tested, exposed to interactive educational interventions, followed by a post-test. The scores were compared using paired samples t-test. There were significant improvements in the knowledge during post-test compared with pre-test. A greater overall improvement was observed in participants who were graduates, as well as those who were clinicians compared to postgraduates and academicians, respectively. A series of short, interactive educational sessions on research may provide an effective way to enhance research interest and knowledge of clinical professionals. Such sessions may play a vital part in improving the chances of better, and research-informed, patient health care provision.

ID CLASSROOM; DISCOURSE; LANGUAGE; SUPPORT
AB Inquiry-based learning has generally accepted by scholars as a most effective teaching approach in biology education. The talk during inquiry-based teaching needs to be practiced. There is less evidence how student teachers talk with students during their inquiry-based biology instruction. This knowledge is needed in supporting student teachers to develop their teachership in biology education. In this qualitative case study, the dialogic talk of biology student teachers (N = 6) was studied in the context of inquiry-based lessons in lower secondary school. The student teachers' lessons were video and audio recorded and the data was analyzed using content analysis. The student teachers used dialogic talk in their inquiry-based instruction only occasionally, mainly in the examination and the conclusion stages. During the introduction stage, dialogic talk was less used and it was mainly explaining and instructing the content. In the examination stage, student teachers also guided students and stated facts. During the conclusion stage, student teachers mainly explained and also evaluated students' statements. The lesson's topics and methods used in inquiry-based learning may enable the dialogic talk of student teacher to some extent. However, teacher education should focus more on scaffolding student teachers' talk with their students in all kinds of inquiry approaches.

AB Urban ecology has matured as a field of investigation. This paper explores how well it has transitioned into the educational curricula of UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) by mapping the presence of urban ecological or environmental topics across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. The prevalence of different topics, the level at which they are taught, and the disciplinary areas in which they are housed, are quantified. Urban ecological topics are found in programmes across 50 of 147 HEIs (34%), mainly taught in ancillary fashion to support wider subjects, though some specialist modules and even programmes do exist. Only one HEI incorporates a compulsory (core) dedicated urban ecology module at undergraduate level. Much urban ecology teaching takes place at advanced undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Applied topics are usually taught from an environmental science perspective, with common examples including urban hydrology, climate, and green infrastructure; probably to address global concerns about urban sustainability and resilience. In particular there is scope for greater incorporation of urban ecology topics and themes into biological and ecological programmes, and utilising cities as labs to explore these topics. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of these possibilities.

ID PLANARIANS
AB A team of six children (13-14 years old) developed and conducted an experiment to assess the behaviour of the planarian flatworm, an invertebrate animal model, before, during and after exposure to chemicals. The aim of the project was to engage children in pharmacology and toxicology research. First, the concept that exposure to chemicals can affect our nervous systems and alter our behaviour was introduced by the scientist. Then pupils were asked to conduct independent online research on chemicals we consume and used this information to select chemicals of interest. Caffeine and the artificial sweetener aspartame were chosen. As aspartame is broken down in the body, the aspartame metabolites phenylalanine, methanol and aspartic acid were also tested. Pupils assessed flatworm behaviour and determined that phenylalanine and methanol altered behaviour. The experiment demonstrated that chemicals can affect the nervous system and can be used in classrooms to illustrate that chemicals, such as recreational drugs, can alter behaviour. Students found the experiential nature of the programme valuable, appreciated the active components and considered the scientist as an 'expert'. This partnership contributes to academic knowledge in children and provides insight into teaching and raises awareness of the curriculum as a tool of social change.

AB Animal experimentation is a controversial topic, especially among the general public and the scientific community. Thirty-eight undergraduate students attending the College of Veterinary Medicine - SAo Paulo State University in the municipality of Aracatuba, SAo Paulo, Brazil, were followed up between 2008 and 2011 and were asked to complete an annual questionnaire focused on different aspects of animal experimentation, including the animal species involved, the objectives of the research, ethics, animal welfare and euthanasia. Most students agreed that animal testing is not morally incorrect, and the dynamics of students' attitudes were notable: undergraduates tended to change their opinion over time, with junior students opposing animal experimentation more than seniors do, indicating that the more scientific knowledge the students acquire, the more favourable to animal experimentation they become. Nevertheless, they agreed that research must consider the basic principles of animal welfare.

DE Scientific competences; Design of teaching sequences; Oral and dental

AB We present a case study to illustrate the design and implementation of a teaching sequence about oral and dental health and hygiene. This teaching sequence was aimed at year 10 students (age 15-16) and sought to develop their scientific competences. In line with the PISA assessment framework for science and the tenets of a context-based approach to science education, the design of the teaching sequence was based on real-life situations. After setting out these premises the paper describes and illustrates the stages and tasks involved in the teaching sequence, and discusses certain aspects of its implementation. We conclude by considering a number of issues related to the teaching sequence, including its transfer to teachers.

AB This study is focused on the development, implementation and evaluation of an environmental education programme for secondary education students. The programme was entitled 'The effects of fire on the soil system' and it was implemented during the school period of 2008. Twenty-four (24) students (aged from 15 to 20) coming from Lidoriki Secondary School (Central Greece) participated in the programme, which was based on Project Method. The programme consisted of one theoretical part (achievement of cognitive and affective goals) and one experimental part (achievement of cognitive and psychomotor goals). Initial, formative and summative assessments were implemented during the course of the programme, by means of questionnaires, observation of students' teamwork and examination of their work sheets. The questionnaire analysis highlighted students' misconceptions regarding the subject, revealed positive changes in students' attitudes as a result of their participation in the programme, as well as satisfactory results concerning the acquired knowledge and skills. The experimental results were of significant scientific and educational value.

AB Self-generated analogical models have emerged recently as alternatives to teacher-supplied analogies and seem to have good potential to promote deep learning and scientific thinking. However, studies of the ways and contexts in which students generate these models are still too limited to allow a fuller appraisal of these models' effectiveness in enhancing conceptual learning in science. This study explores how biology students aged 15-17 generated physical concrete models to represent their understanding of the respiration pathway after learning about it through a conventional flow diagram model. The analogies portrayed in students' self-generated models provide teachers with a supplementary channel to explore students' conceptual understandings of this complicated topic and allow students to reflect on ways in which the abstract pathway portrayed in textbooks actually makes sense to them.

AB It is clear that the teaching of medical statistics needs to be improved, yet areas for priority are unclear as medical students' learning and application of statistics at different levels is not well known. Our goal is to assess the attitudes of medical students toward the learning and application of medical statistics, and discover their learning needs. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of learning and application of medical statistics among graduates and undergraduates at a medical school in Chongqing. More than 70% of the medical students thought that the medical statistics course was as important as other medical courses. Among them, 62.58% of graduate students thought that it was very hard to learn medical statistics, whereas only 27.72% undergraduate students held the same opinion. Both graduates and undergraduates stated that the main difficulties involved in learning medical statistics were its abstract principles and the large quantity of concepts and formulas. In all, 70% of both graduates and undergraduates could conduct a basic statistical analysis of general medical data independently, although undergraduates demonstrated greater proficiency in applying basic statistical methods than did graduates (p<0.05). The most common mistake students made in solving statistical problems was the misuse of statistical methods. In conclusion, medical students do not perform well in learning and applying medical statistical methods despite a clear recognition of the importance of the course, and we should start to make the necessary reforms in the teaching of medical statistics.

AB Bioinformatics, biological databases, and the worldwide use of computers have accelerated biological research in many fields, such as evolutionary biology. Here, we describe a primer of nucleotide sequence management and the construction of a phylogenetic tree with two examples; the two selected are from completely different groups of organisms: hominids and cyanobacteria. The hominid group involves genetic information not only of recent species, but also from fossilised ancestors of modern humans. Nucleotide sequences are used to construct phylogenetic trees. In the case of the cyanobacteria group, the nucleotide sequences obtained from fossilised cyanobacteria were searched across databases to find similar sequences and identify recent relatives. This demonstration of evolutionary history provides real examples of the bioinformatics approach in biological research; additionally, it can be utilised as practical exercises in biological studies, suitable for secondary or tertiary-level classes.

AB This practical paper describes a novel fluorescence imaging experiment to study the three processes of photochemistry, fluorescence and thermal energy dissipation, which compete during the dissipation of excitation energy in photosynthesis. The technique represents a non-invasive tool for revealing and understanding the spatial heterogeneity in leaf performance caused by internal and external factors, such as development and abiotic stress. Fluorescence yield (F), effective PSII quantum yield (Y(II)) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were analysed by fluorescence imaging in leaves of Avena sativa L. and two species of Brassica (B. fruticulosa and B. oleracea) plants during the first stages of plant development and under high illumination. In young leaves, F was 0.1 or less, Y(II) between 0.7 and 0.8 and NPQ less than 0.3, indicating that photochemical efficiency was high (70-80%) and that fluorescence emission (less than 10%) and heat dissipation (less than 30%) were low. As leaf age increased, differences were observed between species, indicating different development and senescence patterns in each. Avena sativa and B. fruticulosa (a wild species adapted to high light intensity in its natural habitat) showed greater tolerance to high illumination than B. oleracea (an agricultural species), which experienced photoinhibition caused by excessive light. This practical paper is intended for advanced students of plant biochemistry and plant physiology.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB We tried to determine the reasoning behind the stances taken by a group of 19-21-year-old students on the controversial issue of the feasibility and acceptability of human gene therapy. The students were in training at a biotechnology institute. We organised classroom debates, punctuated by phases of epistemological `disturbances'. We used a variety of resources from authentic genetic therapy cases. We also worked on the reconsideration of Crick's model on the basis of recent results in molecular genetics and genomics. We stimulated critical analysis by presenting texts on the failure of gene therapies. This also encouraged the students to evaluate the empirical evidence, in the light of current molecular biology data that challenges Crick's dogma. We observed an increase in the intensity of the argumentation. According to Habermas, in all the didactic situations forms of communicative action are used less frequently, whereas forms of strategic action are the most prevalent. However, we found that in the case of the final situation, the students' discourse was more in keeping with communicative action than in the other situations.

AB Citrus fruit (oranges, tangerines, grapefruit or lemons) purchased in a grocery store can be experimentally infected with readily-available sources of Penicillium digitatum to demonstrate the four basic steps of Koch's postulates, also known as proof of pathogenicity. The mould is isolated from naturally-infected citrus fruit into pure culture on artificial agar medium. The mycelium is then reintroduced into uninfected fruit from which the pathogen can be recovered. The entire set of procedures can be completed in as little as four weeks, using easily available equipment. In addition to demonstrating the importance of associating a disease with its causal agent, the exercise also allows for practicing sterile technique. None of the hundreds of students who performed these steps in college lab settings has ever experienced an allergic reaction to the fungus, making this a very safe, quick and inexpensive demonstration.

AB Interest affects learning; it also affects students' attitude towards science and career choices. It is therefore urgent to increase students' interest and improve their attitude towards science to face the complex challenges of the future. This study transformed cutting-edge induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) research into an informal science course to explore the effect of students' situational interest (SI), concept understanding and attitude towards science. A total of 52 tenth-grade students of upper secondary school participated in an informal science course including a one-day workshop and exploration in a science museum, and one-day of lab work in a university laboratory. The questionnaire data were analysed by pre- and post-t test to explore the learning outcomes, and the learning experience reports were content analysed to explore the influencing factors. Results showed that 1) students' SI was significantly enhanced, with the trigger and affective components of SI scoring, but not the value component; 2) Students' iPSC concept understanding was significantly enhanced; 3) The course enhanced students' SI, iPSC concept understanding and attitude towards science via different influencing factors; 4) The value factors may influence students' positive attitude towards science and engagement in science. We also present some suggestions for informal science course design and teaching practice.

AB The app 'Roteiro Entre-Mares' offers digital itineraries for exploring intertidal zones, such as the rocky platform of the Avencas Marine Protected Area. As users travel through the intertidal area, several challenges emphasising the biodiversity and environmental issues are presented. Eighth-grade students (n=63) used this application and were challenged to identify in situ the marine species present in different zones of the intertidal ecosystem. Then, questionnaires and interviews were performed with teachers and students to examine the utilisation of mobile apps as educational tools. The fact that they learnt a lot, autonomously, using the field guide of the app, was among the aspects that the students most appreciated, describing this app as an organised, informative, interesting, and interactive learning tool. Teachers say this is a useful didactic resource because it delivers clear and reliable information that links theory and practice. Hence, this study examines the acceptance of this mobile app as an instructional tool among students and teachers, highlighting the potential of mobile apps as educational tools.

AB The topic of keeping livestock is very well suited to addressing the ecological, social, and economic aspects of the sustainable production of our food in school lessons. However, the production of animal-based foods is mainly outside the personal experience of children and young people. To derive relevant implications for teaching, this paper explores the following research question: 'What conceptions do elementary school students have about keeping fattening pigs and dairy cows on farms?' In more detail, this study examines students' conceptions of stock sizes, husbandry practices, and feeding of fattening pigs and dairy cows and how these differ between urban and farm students. For this purpose, six elementary school students (M-Age = 8.8 years, SD = 0.4 ; 83% female) from Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia were interviewed. Three of the subjects were growing up on a conventional farm with fattening pigs. The study is informed by the Model of Educational Reconstruction. To elicit students' conceptions, we used semi-structured guided interviews, during which students made a drawing of a farm that they described in detail. The data were evaluated with the help of qualitative content analysis. The study results show a wide range of conceptions, ranging from naive and unbiased conceptions to clear conceptions of modern, conventional livestock farming.

AB The importance of genetic diversity, especially within small populations of endangered species, is becoming increasingly apparent. Genetic engineering techniques that could potentially enhance diversity are now being developed. However, the use of such techniques would require social licence and yet within the general population there is limited understanding of the importance of variation within a species. This qualitative study explored the potential of introducing the concept of within-species variation to New Zealand primary school children (5 to 11 year olds) with the aim of preparing these students to make critical decisions about the use of these techniques in their futures. Eighty-four children participated in the study and their explanations for the impact that differences between individuals may have were analysed revealing their scientifically acceptable understanding of the concept. But findings also highlighted potential misconceptions that they may retain. These misconceptions include a belief that animals think and behave in a manner similar to humans or that variations within a species are for identification purposes only. Findings showed that the concept of within-species variation could be introduced to primary school children. However, to do this successfully curriculum documents may need to be reviewed and teachers may require specific professional development.

ID MEDIA
AB Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surfeit of information and misinformation in the media about it. The lockdown in England meant that schools were closed from March to June, meaning that students had limited access, in school, to ask questions and discuss the biology of the novel virus (SARS-CoV-2) or the impact of the pandemic on themselves, their families and friends. In this small-scale exploratory study, we decided to ask students (15-16-year-olds) on their return to school in June 2020 and in September 2020, what they wanted to know about COVID-19. Findings show that their questions were similar at both time points, indicating that students wanted to know the same things. This suggests that despite the high volume of information available in the media, some of the students' questions had not been answered or that sources of information were confused and at times contradictory. Interestingly, the questions they asked were based on reliable sources of news rather than fake news, and this finding seems to contradict the literature that indicates young people are prone to believing misinformation. The implications for teaching and learning about COVID-19, and other zoonotic diseases as socio-scientific issues are discussed.

AB We conducted a short subject matter knowledge-based intervention in a quasi-experimental design and explored whether providing health-related subject matter knowledge affects university students' risk perception and their behavioural intentions. We chose the everyday context of using antiperspirants that contain aluminium and focused on the presumption that antiperspirants facilitate Alzheimer's disease development. This study was devoted to a risk perception gap caused by the epistemic and ontological uncertainty involved in the contextual background of using antiperspirants and developing Alzheimer's disease . By computing repeated measures ANOVA, we found that imparting subject matter knowledge as system, action-related and effectiveness health knowledge increased students' cognitive and affective risk perception. Path analyses revealed that cognitive and affective risk perception had an indirect, negative effect on behavioural intentions towards using antiperspirants. Attitudes and perceived behavioural control fully mediated the relationship between risk perception and intention. The mediation effect differed between students who received subject matter knowledge and students who did not. We discuss the findings from our study related to the role of subject matter knowledge for understanding risk perception, the ambiguity of overcoming and creating a risk perception gap when uncertainty holds and how risk perception relates to attitudes and behavioural intention.

AB The aim of this review is to discuss alternatives to the traditional practicals, undergraduate projects and student placements that are presently being disrupted by Covid-19. We focus on bioscience higher education (biology, biomedical sciences) with an emphasis on the laboratory sciences. In the context of a shifting environmental and political landscape, we consider whether higher education institutions can deliver the latest bioscience skills and knoweldge sought by employers through the use of virtual learning. To take the pressure off being in the laboratory, we suggest that there may be opportunities to reduce lab teaching, and in doing so, meet industry needs for more computational and policy-related knowledge. There may be opportunities for academic teams to build relationships with local businesses and industry partners to find new solutions, and think about how agility can be incorporated into curriculum design to accommodate the rapidly changing external environment. In this paper we share examples of how the authors work together to enhance student employability. Further research is required to understand the views of each stakeholder - student, academic and business or industry partners - in order to fully understand the context of the problems and possible solutions.

ID CREATIONISM
AB In recent decades, the application and adaptation of new technologies have gradually become invaluable in education. When the students are visually impaired, the use of these technologies becomes even more valuable. In this line, a theoretical-practical workshop on human evolution was carried out with 25 students from the Spanish National Organisation for the Blind. Twenty-two realistic replicas of skulls of the main species in human evolution were reproduced with a 3D-FDM printer. Thus, the students were able to learn about the variability of cranial anatomy between species as we could verify with a test to evaluate the usefulness of the technology as a complement to the theoretical explanation. The results were analysed taking into account the sex and age of the students, their educational level, their degree of blindness and previous knowledge of the subject. It showed that the use of 3D models is an excellent support to the teaching-learning process in the case of the visually impaired, since it allows them to form in their imagination a faithful image of the object they hold in their hands, to feel the similarities and morphological differences between the species and to formulate hypotheses about the reasons for them.

AB The digestive system is a fundamental topic in biological science teaching. Despite its importance, the level of students' knowledge on the topic appears to differ from recommended levels at several educational grades. Their knowledge also seems to be resistant to change; therefore, this discrepancy may be viewed as an epistemological obstacle to teaching scientifically updated concepts related to the digestive system. Didactic-pedagogical resources are important tools for overcoming such difficulties. The present study was intended to analyse the use of a practical activity as a possible didactic resource to help (re)construct concepts regarding human digestive physiology and to amplify the conceptual profile of undergraduate students. Data collection was performed using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to assess students' knowledge of the digestive system before and after participating in the practical activity. Qualitative data analysis revealed that previous knowledge was partially aligned with that described in the literature, suggesting a possible epistemological obstacle to teaching and learning scientific concepts. Participation in the activity not only contributed to better understanding of general aspects of the digestive system but also appeared to help overcome possible epistemological obstacles, including the role of the intestine.

AB The attractive photophysical properties of luminescent nanoparticles have prompted numerous studies on their synthesis and biological applications. Due to the complexity of components, sizes, morphologies, and strong light scattering of the nanoparticles the absorption spectrum alone is not enough for characterising and analysing the real absorption band of a nanoparticle product. Instead, the excitation spectrum is necessary for this purpose. To address the importance of the excitation spectrum in the utilisation of the photophysical properties of nanoparticles for cellular imaging, we compared the absorption and excitation spectra of a small organic molecule (rhodamine 6G) and commercially available nanoparticles (semiconductor quantum dots). Rhodamine 6G shows a good superimposition between its absorption and excitation spectra. However, the quantum dots do not, due to the presence of impurities and the polydispersity in nanoparticle size and shape. We demonstrated, by either spectrometer or cellular imaging, that excitation of the quantum dots at the maximum absorption peak will not result in the highest emission intensity. Instead, the best excitation wavelength for the nanoparticles can be revealed by the excitation spectrum. This has usually been overlooked by chemists and biologists.

AB This high school-level, place-based, inquiry-driven laboratory module familiarises students with techniques used to analyse animal behaviour while facilitating the development of the observational skills highlighted by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Throughout the module, students observe, quantify, and discuss local invertebrate behaviours in the classroom. While field-testing the module with Hawai'i high school students, we administered anonymous, online surveys before and after participation to examine whether the use of animals and language from the local environment and cultural landscape unique to Hawai'i helped to connect students with the ecology surrounding them and emphasise the relevancy of scientific observations beyond the classroom. Survey responses indicated increased content understanding, increased confidence in scientific skills, and more positive attitudes towards marine science among participants. Utilising ethological techniques within a place-based framework provides an adaptable platform for students in any location to develop the science literacy skills at the core of NGSS.

AB Changes in environmental conditions can have a profound impact on organismal processes. For aquatic organisms, changes in dissolved oxygen concentration can have major repercussions, notably for physiological processes that have high long-term energetic costs and are more likely to rely on aerobic metabolic pathways. Here we propose a simple college or university-level low-cost laboratory activity that addresses the effect of differences in oxygen concentration on an important physiological property of planarian flatworms: their regeneration capacity. Students were asked to perform measurements and statistically compare the efficacy of the regeneration process between planarians kept in normoxic conditions and others kept in hypoxic conditions. The activity was evaluated by asking students to produce a short laboratory report with all of the sections that a scientific article generally comprises. This hands-on experiment has the benefit of going beyond how planarians are traditionally used in biodiversity classes (i.e. basic anatomy of flatworms) by combining behavioural, physiological and environmental observations while investigating the effects of an environmental variable on the regeneration response. We would further encourage professors to expand even more upon this framework by providing the students with an opportunity to actively engage in all steps inherent to the scientific process.

AB Introductory laboratory courses are a standard component of undergraduate science programmes and historically taught using direct instruction/confirmatory lab models. Previous studies have shown that inquiry-based labs enhance student engagement in science courses. However, research on how direct instruction introductory lab courses effectively engage undergraduate students is lacking. This study, therefore, using a mixed model design, examined student engagement in an introductory direct instruction microbiology lab. Data was collected through self-report surveys, classroom observations, and interviews at a Midwestern, post-secondary institution in the USA. The findings suggest that students found the lab activities engaging. This study provides baseline data which describes student engagement and student perspectives in a direct instruction undergraduate microbiology lab course. This baseline data can be used in further research against which comparisons can be made when studying other types of lab teaching interventions.

AB Exemplary for social insects, Temnothorax ants allow for various handson investigations in biology classes. The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of secondary school students' learning achievement after teaching units with ants lasting between one and six weeks. The questionnaires included transfer and factual knowledge tasks divided into eight fields of knowledge. Students (N = 459) from 22 classes participated in the study and received different treatments: The experimental group (n = 366) started their investigations by initial observation using stereo microscopes, while the control group (n = 93) conducted ant research without this introductory teaching unit. We investigated the influence of class level, gender and time period of participation on knowledge acquisition. Independent of class level, factual learning achievement was observed for all fields of knowledge except ecology. We did not find a positive correlation between time period of participation and basic ant knowledge acquisition. The findings suggest that ant research may be implemented within the framework of a progressive curriculum for all secondary school students. However, attentive and detailed observation of ant colonies with stereo microscopes and continuous repetition of technical terms seem to be inevitable preconditions for learning achievement.

AB Teaching scientific writing in biology classes is challenging for both students and instructors. This article offers and reviews several useful 'toolkit' items that improve student writing. These include sentence and paper-length templates, funnelling and compartmentalisation, and preparing compendiums of corrections. In addition, students benefit from reviewing scientific figures and learning about the verbs used in scientific papers. The approaches and exercises presented in this paper empower students in their development of a personal writing style. Often, however, the best tools are those that students develop with each other, a method of tool building addressed in this article.

AB In the present study, we have explored an aspect of teachers' perceptions of biology diagrams. The research was performed in Turkey. The data were gathered from 50 (25 female, 25 male) teachers of primary and secondary schools and 34 (18 female, 16 male) academic staff of different universities in Turkey. Some of the participants are science specialists and the others are non-science specialists. The data were collected in 2012. A qualitative approach was adopted. The data were collected in three steps. First, biology diagrams from the internet were collected and some (12) biology diagrams were chosen by the researchers. In the second step, these selected diagrams were shown to the teachers and academic staff. In this step the participants were asked to think aloud about what they saw when they looked at the diagrams. In the third step, semi-structured interviews were carried out in order to examine further the thoughts of the participants about what they saw in these diagrams. In our study we found there were no significant differences in responses between the science and non-science specialist teachers and academic staff. We conclude that it may be helpful to train teachers in the processes of constructing and reading diagrams.

TI Building a zoological teaching collection of invertebrates using

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

ID FORENSIC ENTOMOLOGY; CLASSROOM
AB Teaching collections are of great importance for science instruction at any level. There are several problems linked to the handling and curatorial management of this kind of collection. Among these is the relatively short life-span of specimens, due to the damage from continuous handling by students. Often the specimens used to replenish the teaching collection come from sampling in field. This is at odds with the ethics of conservation and the use of and experimentation on animals in biology. The technique proposed in the present work is an effective and low-cost way to build a macroinvertebrate wet teaching collection and store invertebrate animals for pedagogical purposes, preserving the specimens, and allowing the use of rare or fragile specimens in school and university teaching settings as well as in training courses programmes. A collection preserved in alcoholic gel has been used to test a handbook for identification of aquatic macroinvertebrates from Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, and in theoretical-practical lessons for training students in the water quality research programme in the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation/Ministry of Health, Brazil.

AB Insects form a highly diverse taxonomic group, which has fundamental ecological functions, but is currently in a process of mass extinction. Here, we present the first cycle of design, implementation, and assessment of a didactic sequence oriented towards improving pre-service teachers' knowledge and appreciation of insect diversity. A methodological approach aiming to promote rigorous observation was followed, for which activities consisting of scientific and naturalistic drawing, among others, were included. The sequence was contextualised at a university organic garden, both to make learning meaningful and to promote new personal experiences with alive insects. We present the empirical results of the first implementation with a group of 28 pre-school (3-6 years) pre-service teachers at a Spanish university. Assessment was based on the analysis of drawings with a purposely designed instrument to assess constructive accuracy, and on the qualitative analysis of open questions that were posed before and after the implementation. Positive results were obtained regarding participants' knowledge of insect diversity, and positive impacts were observed also on their attitudes. Improvements to some activities are suggested before subsequent implementations of the didactic sequence. Finally, our study supports the effectiveness of maintaining organically managed gardens as facilities for biological education.

AB The aim of this study is to design various instructional materials to teach biological systems in a 'Systems in Our Body' unit to 6(th) grade students with visual impairment (SVI) and to evaluate the effectiveness of these materials. In the study, a design-based research model was used. In the first stage, individual learning needs of SVI and their understanding of biological structures in the 'Systems in Our Body' unit were determined. In the second stage, instructional materials matching the individual needs were designed and implemented. In the last stage, the usefulness of these materials and their effects on learning were explored. As a result of the study, it was seen that designed instructional materials made positive contributions to students' learning and understanding.

AB The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between Turkish high school students' perceptions of learning environment, conceptions of learning biology and achievement goal orientations. In order to determine the relation among these three sets of variables, canonical correlation analyses were conducted. A total of 398 high school students participated in this survey. In line with the purpose of the study, three measurement tools (Constructivist Learning Environment Survey, Conceptions of Learning Biology Scale and Achievement Goal Orientations Scale) were employed. The results of the analysis have shown that the relationship between these three sets of variables is meaningful. Based on these findings, the possibility that both Turkish high school students' perceptions of learning environment and achievement goal orientations are statistically influential in their conceptions of learning was discussed in the light of the related literature.

AB Biosphere contamination is a current environmental and social issue that must be included in the school programme. It is essential that students recognise their responsibility, and be knowledgeable about the generation and reduction of environmental pollution. Dyes are usually used in school activities and discharged into household effluents, constituting potential toxic agents. To offer solutions to this problem, it was proposed to evaluate the ability of Lemna sp. plants to remove synthetic dyes. For this, activities that require accessible resources and minimum safety precautions were designed, which could be carried out by students at home in the virtual education modality imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The practical experience integrated theoretical-practical contents from different disciplines, achieving a true interdisciplinary dialogue. The use of Lemna sp. secured a fast and significant dye decolourisation, demonstrating the importance of biodiversity in the attenuation of environmental changes due to anthropogenic activities. This experience allowed us to arrive at an interdisciplinary, significant and situated learning experience through the implementation of the scientific method.

   introductory biology; textbook analysis
AB Plant awareness disparity (PAD, formerly plant blindness) is the tendency not to notice plants in one's environment, which leads to the perspective that plants are unimportant. In this paper, we explore how plants and animals are represented in introductory biology textbooks to determine if these texts are contributing to PAD in undergraduate students. We analysed images from four texts that are commonly used as introductory biology textbooks for biology majors, and specifically focused on the introductory, genetics, and evolution chapters. We found that animals are chosen more often as examples of biological concepts in textbook images across all four textbooks, indicating that these texts are contributing to PAD. Textbook producers should focus on including a more equal number of plant and animal examples of biology concepts and processes, and instructors should bring in outside examples and images to supplement those currently in texts that demonstrate a bias towards animals.

   syllabus
AB A Foldscope is an ultra-affordable paper microscope with a magnification up to 2000X and 2 micron resolution. It is economic, durable and easy to handle tool for scientific studies. Many govt. schools of Kamrup district, Assam found it difficult to use microscope in their regular practical classes for its complexity and high cost. For visualization of specimen under Foldscope, light source used is either natural light (during day time) or artificial light source operating on batteries. Being extremely light weight and portable, it could be easily carried along to field for various studies. In the present study, practical sessions and awareness on this instrument was conducted in the govt. and private schools of Kamrup (M), Assam. Students and school authority?s feedback were collected for analyzing the scope of Foldscope in future use as a part of their syllabus. The hands on training of the instrument helped the student?s to understand microscopic world of biology. Hence, it could be concluded that Foldscope could be incorporated in every school?s syllabus for better understanding of biology by reducing school experimental expenses and overcoming the facility constraints.

AB While metabolism is a fundamental process in physiology, the measurement of metabolism by living animals often requires specialized and expensive equipment. In 2016, I developed a novel laboratory exercise for animal physiology students where students were able to observe the effects of temperature and long-term temperature acclimation on the physiology of the Eastern grass shrimp, Palaemonetes paludosus. In this lab, grass shrimp were housed for 1 week at one of three temperatures, 20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C. While grass shrimp encounter temperatures considerably colder than this in the wild, we were limited by the temperatures we could achieve without access to aquarium chillers. The students then moved shrimp into water of different temperatures and measured metabolic rates indirectly using heart rate and oxygen consumption. The initial results showed noticeable shifts in baseline metabolic rate over a relatively short, 2 week long acclimation period. In both heart rate and oxygen consumption, metabolic rates climbed predictably with temperature, consistent with the literature on responses in ectotherms. Also, consistent with the literature, the shrimp that were acclimated to warmer temperatures downregulated their metabolism to compensate, showing the lower metabolic rate at all three temperatures.

AB The aim of the research is to examine the contribution of applying author-generated dichotomous keys (digital key - DDK and print key - DPK) to the quality and durability of the knowledge of eighth grade students about the Systematic and classifications of plants (Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms), as compared to traditional teaching. The study included 180 eighth grade students from Montenegro (12-13 years old) divided into three groups: E-1 (where content was learned through DPK), E-2 (where content was learned through DDK) and K (where content was learned through the verbal-textual method). Dichotomous keys contributed to increasing the quality and durability of the knowledge acquired in comparison to traditional teaching at the cognitive levels of analysis, evaluation and synthesis. DDK contributed to the higher quality and durability of student knowledge in comparison to DPK at the cognitive levels of evaluation and synthesis.

TI Using <i>C-elegans</i> notch mutants in an undergraduate cancer biology
   laboratory course to demonstrate oncogenic effects on cell proliferation

ID GLP-1; MUTATIONS
AB Undergraduate laboratory exercises addressing aspects of cancer biology such as increased cell proliferation, gain-of-function signaling mutations and tumour formation often rely on tissue culture or even small mammal models. Many departments have limited or no access to these tools, and even well-equipped departments face logistical problems when incorporating these models into laboratory classes. I have developed a laboratory exercise using the microscopic worm, C. elegans, to demonstrate the effects of Notch receptor mutations on cell proliferation. Notch, which is activated by juxtacrine signaling, is mutated in many human cancers. In this exercise, students compare the germline phenotypes of worms that have a loss-of-function Notch mutation (no cells in the germline) or a gain-of-function Notch mutation (over-proliferation resulting in a germline tumour). Students also genotype the worms and perform sequence analysis to determine the effects of the mutations on the protein sequence. This laboratory exercise demonstrates oncogenic proliferation, correlates genotype to phenotype, exposes students to model organisms and introduces sequence databases and analysis. In addition to cancer biology courses, this exercise could be incorporated in courses with a focus on genetics, cell biology or developmental biology.

AB Plants have an enormous importance for life on earth but are often overlooked. This phenomenon called plant blindness is reinforced as students prefer to spend their recreation time with modern media rather than in nature. Mobile devices have become an omnipresent part of students' everyday lives. Nevertheless, direct experiences with plants are needed to create an empathic link. We decided to combine mobile learning with plant education in the context of an excursion. Therefore, we created an interactive treasure hunt-like quiz for mobile devices through a botanic garden as an approach to positively influence students' knowledge about and attitude towards plants and nature. The main topic was the variety of flowers which is why we called it the flower hunt. Besides the comprehension of plant diversity, its endangerment and protection, attention was given to flower morphology and ecology as well as to systematics. Our results showed increased performances especially in systematics. Students were motivated to take part and enjoyed the implementation. Although the unit did not entirely cure plant blindness it increased students' environmental awareness. Thus, the flower hunt provides a new educational approach for promoting conservation.

ID DESIGN
AB Potential benefits of simulations and virtual laboratory exercises in natural sciences have been both theorised and studied recently. This study reports findings from a pilot study on student attitude, motivation and self-efficacy when using the virtual laboratory programme Labster. The programme allows interactive learning about the workflows and procedures of biological and biochemical experiments, the operation of relevant apparatuses, including the ability to adjust parameters, and the production of results. The programme was used as supplement to mandatory laboratory exercises in two undergraduate courses (i. microbiology and ii. pharmaceutical toxicology) at the University of Southern Denmark. With a theoretical basis in motivational theories, students' (n=73) motivation and attitude towards the virtual exercises were evaluated. After completing virtual laboratory cases, the students felt significantly more confident and comfortable operating laboratory equipment, but they did not feel more motivated to engage in virtual laboratories compared to real laboratories. Teachers observed that students were able to participate in discussions at higher levels than in previous years where the programme was not used. The study concludes that virtual laboratories have the potential to improve students' pre-laboratory preparation.

Many plant species in almost any part of the world are under serious threats due to various reasons such as deforestation, pollution-of air, water and soil-caused by industrialisation, overgrazing and rapid population growth. It is likely that people have strong positive attitudes towards conservation of plants. This study investigated the effectiveness of an instructional approach based on integration of botany with chemistry and art on students' attitude towards plants. This study was carried out in a science summer school for 10-12-years-old students ( N = 49) in Turkey. The Plant Attitude Questionnaire was used as pre-test and post-test to assess the effects of the instruction on the students' attitudes towards plants. Moreover, the participating children were asked to keep journals throughout the instruction. The children's journals served as a data collection tool. The findings of the study indicated that integration of botany with chemistry and art is a good way to support children's positive attitudes towards plants, particularly for an instructional approach based on the integration of plants with various disciplines to support children's interest and enjoyment of plants. Also, this approach could offer children opportunities to understand the importance of plants in the living environments of humans and other organisms, and material benefits from plants in industry.

AB We present a practical activity focusing on two main goals: to give learners the opportunity to experience how the scientific method works and to increase their knowledge about enzymes in everyday situations. The exercise consists of determining the amylase activity of commercial detergents. The methodology is based on a qualitative assay using a colorimetric process. Quantitative results are also obtained by measuring the halo formed. This activity is suitable for and adaptable to learners at different levels of education: primary school, secondary education or even for pre-service teachers, which is the group the version described in this paper was intended for. This laboratory activity was designed to include the scientific method as a learning outcome. This was especially important in pre-service teachers, as increasing scientific literacy is one of the primary goals of science education. Through the activity, students also learn about micro-organisms and their applications in their daily lives, which is one of the tenets of Science-Technology-Society-Environment programs. A case study was conducted with a group of learners made up of 75 pre-service teachers from Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, in order to verify whether this lab activity is well designed and can be satisfactorily implemented.

AB While school textbooks are assumed to be written for and used by students, it is widely acknowledged that they also serve a vital support function for teachers, particularly in times of curriculum change. A basic assumption is that biology textbooks are scientifically accurate. Furthermore, because of the negative impact of misconceptions' on learning, it is desirable that textbooks point out common misconceptions and why they are scientifically unacceptable. This paper reports on a study of life sciences textbooks as a potential influence on misconceptions about evolution by natural selection. Textbooks for Grades 10 to 12, from two different publishers, were investigated using content analysis to establish, first, the nature and extent of scientifically incorrect statements about evolution; second, latent problems with wording which might lead to unscientific ideas; and third, whether the books identified and addressed common misconceptions. Unscientific statements were found in all six books, but latent problems associated with the way explanations were expressed were also considered to pose a significant threat to learning. While particularly important for textbook authors and publishers, these findings are also of value to teachers. Although this study was conducted in South Africa, the findings provide useful insights for a wider audience of biology education stakeholders.

AB The effect of problem-based learning (PBL) applications in an undergraduate biochemistry course on students' interest in this course was investigated through four modules during one semester. Students' views about active learning and improvement in social skills were also collected and evaluated. We conducted the study with 36 senior students from the Faculty of Science at Dokuz Eylul University in Turkey. Pre- and post-tests were the primary tools used in this study and the Problem-Based Learning Assessment Scale was applied after each module to assess the students' views about the applications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to determine students' pre- and post- attitudes toward the biochemistry course. According to the results, problem quality played an important role in students' academic achievement. The decreased orientation role played by the tutor toward the end of the PBL process showed that students could find the necessary information by investigating themselves, and associate new information and experiences with their existing knowledge. Additionally, results of semi-structured interviews indicated that their skills in the areas of working collaboratively in a group, fulfilling responsibilities and expression of ideas in a group also improved. In conclusion, it can be argued that PBL as an active learning approach is very effective for formation of knowledge, improvement in social skills and interest in a biochemistry course.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DE Conceptions of teachers; Teaching of biology; Biological evolution
ID SCIENCE
AB Biology is a science that involves study of the diversity of living organisms. This diversity has always generated questions and has motivated cultures to seek plausible explanations for the differences and similarities between types of organisms. In biology teaching, these issues are addressed by adopting an evolutionary approach. The aim of this study was to compare the extent to which the beliefs of 20 public high school biology teachers in the Bauru region of Sao Paulo in Brazil exemplified the most significant historical concepts regarding evolution. Data from open-ended interviews with teachers were analysed and coded. The analysis of the interviews revealed how participating biology teachers understood and explained biological evolution. The assessment of teachers' conceptions about evolution indicated that many responses expressed current scientifically accepted concepts, such as transformism, natural selection, gradualism and common descent. However, some teachers also provided responses that combined scientific concepts with non-scientific notions, such as finalism, verticality and adaptation to the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate biology teachers' understanding of evolutionary processes.

AB This study analysed the characteristics that children in the initial stages of schooling attribute to living beings. Interviews were conducted with 138 children aged 3-7 years in a school in the Spanish city of A Coruna, Galicia. Aspects found in pen-and-paper activities dealing with living beings, provided by the teachers (158 in total) at this school, were also analysed. The findings show that the children recognised that humans/animals are alive, but the youngest ones in particular did not recognise that plants are alive. The children used morphological and functional aspects to explain that the different specimens are alive, although they had difficulties using the same characteristics for humans/animals and plants. The activities provided by the teachers were aimed more at identifying specific specimens than at studying the key ideas that characterise living beings in general. The paper also discusses the fact that these activities do not make it easier for the pupils to acquire a unified or accurate concept of what a living being is.

AB This study presents the results of a pilot learning intervention for improving children's ideas about plant protection. The research was executed in two phases. The first phase aimed at exploring children's ideas about plant protection. These ideas were taken into account for the design and development of a digital learning environment. The second phase concerned the development, implementation and evaluation of the learning environment. In the first phase, 262 participants (10-12 years old) were asked to write a short text about Environmental protection'. During the second phase, twenty-six participants (10-12 years old) were asked to write a text on How we can protect the endemic plants', before and after the implementation of the learning activities. Responses were content analysed and their meaning was classified according to the coding scheme of Blanchet-Cohen, Ragan, and Amsden (Children, Youth and Environments 2003; 13: 1-7). The results of the first phase showed that participants mentioned individual lifestyle actions of environmental protection and, therefore, the learning environment should emphasise the importance of other types of environmental protection (eg political actions, legislation, social actions). The proposed learning activities enriched participants' awareness about the importance of social and legal actions for plant protection.

AB To understand genetics, students need to be able to explain and draw connections between a large number of concepts. The purpose of the study reported herein was to explore the way upper secondary science students reason about concepts in molecular genetics in order to understand protein synthesis. Data were collected by group interviews. Concept maps were constructed using the interview transcripts, and analysed. The most central concept was DNA, which served as a link between the concepts of genes and proteins. Students spontaneously introduced concepts from classical genetics to explain molecular genetics. The concept maps generated from the different group interviews were similar in that various concepts consistently appeared within specific sub-groups of interconnected concepts, ie clusters. Five main clusters were identified. The students were better able to relate between concepts within a cluster than between concepts in different clusters. The clusters can be seen as representations of the students' knowledge structures, and could be used as starting points in teaching genetics. We recommend that courses in genetics should begin by focusing on students' existing connections between concepts from different clusters and then point out concepts that feature in two or more clusters such as DNA, gene, and protein.

TI Alignment between High School Biology Curriculum Standard and the
   standardised tests of four provinces in China
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE alignment; standard; standardised test; education reform
AB With the development and implementation of new curriculum standards, the field tests of education reform in senior high schools began in 2004 in four pilot provinces in mainland China. After five years of the reform, it is necessary to know how and to what extent the curriculum standard guides test classroom instruction. The present study was conducted with the aims of quantitatively exploring the alignments between the national High School Biology Curriculum Standard and the standards-based High School Exit Exam (HSEE) of 2009 in the four provinces, using Porter's alignment model. As a result, it was found that none of the four provinces' standardised tests of 2009 analysed were significantly aligned with the national Biology Curriculum Standard. The low alignment indexes are mainly because the four HSEEs analysed generally require lower levels of cognitive skills than that of the Standard. These results deserve universal attention by both policymakers and test developers in mainland China.

TI Work placements for bioscience undergraduates: are they really

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION

DE bioscience undergraduates; transferable skills; placements; work
   experience
AB Degree-integrated placements (DIPs) are an important learning experience for many bioscience undergraduates. How these extended experiences will be affected by the proposed changes in higher education funding in the UK is uncertain. This paper explores one bioscience degree programme to investigate the contention that learning outcomes, traditionally attributed to extended undergraduate work placements, can equally well be gained from other strands of teaching in higher education institutions. The research compares two groups of bioscience students: those who have been on a DIP and those who have not. It gauges the acquisition of transferable skills in both workplace settings and also in three other strands of the degree programme. Findings suggest that the broad learning that is gained from a DIP cannot be replicated in other strands of undergraduate experience; nor can it be achieved in less structured types of work experience. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

AB The instructional use of animals is a popular strategy to engage students with science, enhance their motivation, and promote values such as respect, tolerance, and empathy for all living beings. Although these beneficial outcomes are widely acknowledged, research has not provided reliable indicators of their efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to broaden the studies focused on the use of animals in education. In this regard, it becomes necessary to understand students' attitudes towards animals. This paper presents data on the attitudes of primary school children towards the humane treatment of animals. It follows the implementation of a longitudinal project based on the concept of 'classroom pet', aimed at fostering the development of scientific reasoning competencies and positive attitudes towards animals. To assess the project's efficacy, a methodology combining quantitative and qualitative assessment approaches was outlined. The study involved 43 students, aged 8-10, from two fourth-grade classes of the same school. Findings concerning how children's attitudes towards different animals and animal uses are modulated as the result of an animal-based educational intervention and naturally throughout their maturation are discussed. This study provides relevant information for the development and evaluation of humane educational programmes.

AB A large-scale paper-and-pencil assessment of the attainment targets of environmental studies with a focus on the subject area nature was held in primary education in Flanders (Belgium). The tests on different subfields of nature, i.e. the human body, healthcare, organisms, ecosystems, environmental care and non-living nature, were administered to a representative sample of 4556 pupils of the sixth grade from 145 different schools. The percentage of students mastering the attainment targets differed clearly across the tested subfields. Moreover, gender differences were found. Multilevel analyses revealed that 13% of the total variance of the performance on an overall scale could be attributed to differences between schools. For 82%, these school differences were accounted for by factors mainly referring to the language spoken at home and to the socio-economic background of the pupils. Differences among pupils within schools were explained only to a small extent.

   germination
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Seed germination; primary school students; trainee teachers; inquiry;
   comparative research
AB Research into seed germination classroom activities has been common in the last few decades. Didactic proposals have generally focused on the implementation of guided activities in a specific educational stage and context, and an evaluation of the results. However, it is not evident that students approach seed and germination concepts with a reasoned argument. In light of this, comparative research using an inquiry approach was undertaken with 59 primary school students and 82 trainee teachers at an education faculty in Spain, over two academic years. The results showed that it is necessary to give greater relevance to experimental activities to produce reasoned argumentation of seed and germination concepts. Activities should focus on variables that differ from those typical of common or historical agricultural knowledge. Variables derived from genetic information (size of the seed, latency period) are significant and helpful. It is also considered essential to work on the meaning and proper use of scientific terms, such as living and inert matter, sun-light-heat, or plant germination and growth processes. The search for explanations and the development of justifications, for example relating the excess of water to a lack of oxygen for the seeds, is also essential.

ID PROTEIN-STRUCTURE; LITERACY
AB Proteins are essential for cell function, and their biological performance depends on three-dimensional (3D) structures. Insulin is made up of 51 amino acids and is a critical hormone involved in glycaemia regulation. In basic education, concepts involving proteins (synthesis, structure, interactions, and function) are abstract and difficult for students to understand. The use of protein 3D models that assist in visualising biomolecular structures can be an important didactic tool to understand the complexity of protein structure. Here, we propose a practical activity for the construction of a 3D model of insulin, as a tool for teaching protein synthesis and structure to students in the 9(th)-grade of basic education. The activity involved three classes of one hour each. 62 students role-played the insulin mRNA translation and represented the primary structure through balloons tied to a string. They also built an 3D insulin model using Styrofoam balls and wire. The activities proved to be effective, as there was a better understanding by students regarding proteins and their characteristics. Therefore, practical classes for teaching proteins can be used in basic education to improve learning of abstract and sub-microscopic concepts.

AB Gamifying is related to the motivational gain and engagement of participants in these systems, even in situations not exclusively related to the creative and entertainment industry. In the Biology teaching context, motivational strategies have fundamental importance to the learning process. The aim of this work was to investigate the development and application of gamified systems, mainly board games, in Biology teaching. Through a systematic review, 39 scientific studies published in the Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were identified and categorised. As a result, an increased distribution of publications under this focus was observed over the analysed period. The main benefits attributed to the use of board games as a teaching-learning tool were: low cost and accessibility; wide applicability and flexibility; overcoming of communicative and cognitive barriers; improved motivation, engagement and learning; and stimulus of new experiences and skills. This study suggests that board games are a promising strategy to be used in the process of teaching-learning Biology, although some limitations can be reported.

AB It is essential that concepts surrounding species interactions and their importance for biodiversity conservation are widely taught and understood. Incorporating playfulness into ecological education initiatives can attract more interest in these aspects of ecology. Over the last three decades Pokemon has engaged with millions of people by replicating many aspects of real-world wildlife in cartoons and games. Studies have speculated how the Pokemon franchise creates opportunities for didactic purposes. This study aims to identify the potential for ecological interactions portrayed in the Pokemon universe to contribute to children's engagement and learning. We first gathered information on all the ecological interactions described among Pokemon 'species' from the franchise's website. We found 150 Pokemon species engaging in an array of different ecological interactions. We tested the use of Pokemon as a teaching tool about ecological interactions to high-school students aged >= 18 years. The use of Pokemon significantly increased learning of almost half of ecological interactions and raised engagement, particularly among students who like the franchise. Our findings show that Pokemon can be a playful and didactic tool for teaching about ecological interactions.

AB We examined the effects of applying the instructional method of constructive controversy in an animal welfare unit, on middle-school students' knowledge and attitudes relating to the treatment and welfare of animals. Accordingly, we developed and implemented a four-stage instructional model centring on constructive controversy in a class of 27 eighth-grade students aged between 13 and 14 years old at a Beijing school. Our study entailed a pre-test and post-test study design, with data collected through questionnaires completed manually by the students and through semi-structured interviews. We assessed students' understandings of and attitudes towards animal welfare before and after the implementation of the instructional unit. The results of our study clearly indicated that the students' understandings of animal welfare increased, and they displayed more positive attitudes towards the treatment of animals and animal welfare issues after they had completed the unit. Moreover, during the semi-structured interviews, they provided positive evaluations of the activities designed for this unit.

AB While Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is essential in the high school curriculum, it often carries a reputation of being formidable and overwhelming. The resulting unease students often face inhibits their ability to learn effectively; thus it can be beneficial to integrate a more familiar approach to teach them such complex topics. We have developed a technology-enabled learning environment surrounding the use of 3D prints focused on the topics of homoeostasis and immunity for a ninth grade Living Environment class. The teacher and students' surveys reveal that the 3D prints helped the students to effectively learn the material leading to a better understanding and retention of the topics. The results from the students' performance, as well as the teacher and students' feedback from the activity, demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D prints on maintaining their interest through a student-centred, student-led learning activity.

AB Feedback loop reasoning is an essential part of systems thinking, which includes the analysis and description of system behaviour and regulative measures. In feedback loops, every change can simultaneously represent a cause and an effect. Research on reasoning in feedback loops is limited to investigating students' existing mental models. This thinking-aloud study extends insight to the field by providing causal loop diagrams to examine reasoning related to feedback loops. High school students (N = 30, 14-16 years) analysed system behaviours and regulative measures based on the regulation of blood glucose. We developed a category system examining students' prior knowledge and different reasoning patterns (general feedback loop reasoning, reversing cause-effect relationships, and explanations of equilibrium). Our results indicate that students consider direct, or direct and incomplete indirect cause-effect relationships. However, their response patterns vary depending on different task types (system behaviour, regulative measures, and complex system behaviour). Regarding equilibrium, most students explained it through opposing external factors, while only a few considered feedback loop mechanisms that maintain equilibrium. Therefore, we would recommend that teachers distinguish between the hidden dynamics of regulative processes and the visible maintenance of stable conditions by using appropriate external representations to explain phenomena such as equilibrium.
