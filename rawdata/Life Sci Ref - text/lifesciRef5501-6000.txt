AB Over the last few decades, there has been a shift in the classroom from lecture-based to active learning settings with the argument that students retain more information when they are involved in the learning process. This correlation is even stronger when the active learning setting incorporates a real-world or personal connection. Using active learning activities that develop students' ability to comprehend primary scientific literature is particularly important in the field of immunology, due to the rapid expansion of information in the field, which has been further accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By nature, immunology is interdisciplinary, requiring an integrated knowledge of concepts from several scientific disciplines to understand complex immune processes. Engaging undergraduate students through the use of primary literature can improve scientific literacy, develop critical thinking, and enhance understanding of complex topics. To explore this, we utilized a group learning activity in an introductory immunology course that incorporated both a coronavirus-related review and COVID-19 clinical research article. We found that this learning activity significantly enhanced student confidence in key scientific literacy skills: reading scientific literature, clearly explaining relevant points, and describing conclusions generated from the data. Moreover, all students reported that they enjoyed the activity and that it helped them understand more about the current COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the immune response.

AB While it is essential for life science students to be trained in modern techniques and approaches, rapidly developing, interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics present distinct challenges to undergraduate educators. In particular, many educators lack training in new fields, and high-quality teaching and learning materials may be sparse. To address this challenge with respect to bioinformatics, the Network for the Integration of Bioinformatics into Life Science Education (NIBLSE), in partnership with Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES), developed incubators, a novel collaborative process for the development of open educational resources (OER). Incubators are short-term, online communities that refine unpublished teaching lessons into more polished and widely usable learning resources. The resulting products are published and made freely available in the NIBLSE Resource Collection, providing recognition of scholarly work by incubator participants. In addition to producing accessible, high-quality resources, incubators also provide opportunities for faculty development. Because participants are intentionally chosen to represent a range of expertise in bioinformatics and pedagogy, incubators also build professional connections among educators with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and promote the discussion of practical issues involved in deploying a resource in the classroom. Here we describe the incubator process and provide examples of beneficial outcomes. Our experience indicates that incubators are a low cost, short-term, flexible method for the development of OERs and professional community that could be adapted to a variety of disciplinary and pedagogical contexts.

AB Biotechnological pharmaceuticals is a key course offered to third-year undergraduates majoring in biotechnology in our university. However, students often experience difficulties in understanding the principles of related technologies. In this study, we developed and implemented an elective course on preliminary structural biology for biotechnology undergraduates, aiming at reinforcing the principles of these technologies by experimental practice. The course was composed of three phases and lasted for 15 weeks, 18 students were randomly divided into six teams and were encouraged to design, prepare, carry out, and conclude a project on their own. The main contents of their project were cloning, expression, purification, and crystal screening of HpaA, a lipoprotein from the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Examination scores of biotechnology pharmaceuticals were used to assess learning outcomes. The results showed that students who participated in this course gained higher scores in the final examination, and they performed better on the questions specifically related to the elective course. These results demonstrated that the course enhanced students' understanding of the technologies involved in this course by practical applications. Thus, this elective course was effective in helping biotechnology undergraduates to learn the theory and application of biological technologies, and the experience gained in this course may be useful for other technology-based courses.

AB X-ray crystallography provides structural information of molecules at the atomic level, being a central technique at the forefront of science and technology. However, crystallography teaching is not usually implemented in biochemistry lab classes due to its complex execution by nonexpert users. Here, we report the basic step-by-step workflow performed by crystallographers in order to solve the three-dimensional structure of a protein. All these activities were executed in a course for Latin-American graduate students with no previous knowledge on X-ray crystallography entitled "Crystallography in Structural Biology: why do we need a protein crystal, and how do we get it?." We would like to share our experience with the educational research community, with the main purpose being to enrich teaching in biochemistry and structural molecular biology by performing a series of interesting laboratory and computer experiments.

AB Technology has become an indispensable component of both modern life science and life science education. However, due to inadequate knowledge and experience, teachers are often unable to include technology essential for practicing science in their teaching. In this regard, professional development workshops for in-service and preservice teachers are beneficial. In this study, we described the role of a professional development workshop in enhancing teachers' technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge through the lens of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework. Our study is also an example of how teachers can be informed about the current trends in modern research and technology and trained to bring similar research into their classroom.

AB Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are a revolutionary tool based on a bacterial acquired immune response system. CRISPR has gained widespread use for gene editing in a variety of organisms and is an increasingly valuable tool for basic genetic research, with far-reaching implications for medicine, agriculture, and industry. This lab is based on the premise that upper division undergraduate students enrolled in a Life Sciences curriculum must become familiar with cutting edge advances in biotechnology that have significant impact on society. Toward this goal, we developed a new hands-on laboratory exercise incorporating the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and homology directed repair (HDR) to edit two well-characterized genes in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The two genes edited in this exercise, Adenine2 (ADE2) and Sterile12 (STE12) affect metabolic and developmental processes, respectively. Editing the premature stop codons in these genes results in clearly identifiable phenotypes that can be assessed by students in a standard laboratory course setting. Making use of this basic eukaryotic model organism facilitates a laboratory exercise that is inexpensive, simple to organize, set up, and present to students. This exercise enables undergraduate students to initiate and follow-up on all stages of the CRISPR gene editing process, from identification of guide RNAs, amplification of an appropriate HDR fragment, and analysis of mutant phenotypes. The organization of this protocol also allows for easy modification, providing additional options for editing any expressed genes within the yeast genome to produce new mutations, or recovery of existing mutants to wild type.

AB The enrichment of plant foods with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is currently an interesting issue in the field of nutraceuticals and can be used as an experiment for upper-division undergraduate students. Here, an interdisciplinary hands-on experiment to produce GABA-enriched mung bean sprouts using common household reagents is described. Based on the GABA biosynthesis pathways, two key factors, being the availability of l-glutamic acid and the acidification of the germination environment, were chosen for the study of the effects on the enhancement of GABA levels. The activities not only led students to a deeper understanding of biochemistry contents, but also gave the students the opportunity to work with experimental design, analytical chemistry, and statistical data analysis. Furthermore, since mung bean sprouts are familiar foods and the reagents used for germination are easily obtainable and generally recognized as safe, the optimal protocol investigated in the lab could be further applied to the production of bean sprouts with enhanced nutritional values in everyday life, promoting the transfer of knowledge learned in school to practical environments such as home and community.

AB Many fruits and vegetables undergo browning when they are cut and the tissue is exposed to the air. This is due to the activity of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO, EC 1.14.18.1) with endogenous substrates. In this laboratory experiment, students prepare slices of different varieties of apples and assess the rate of browning. They make a simple extract of the apple tissue and measure the activity of PPO using 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) as substrate. They determine the protein concentration of the extract with the Bradford Coomassie Blue reagent and calculate the specific activity of PPO. Finally, the students measure the total concentration of the potential substrates for PPO with the Folin-Ciocalteau phenol reagent using a gallic acid standard curve. By comparing the tendency of the apples to turn brown, the specific activity of PPO, and the concentration of potential substrates, they can assess the biochemical basis of the browning phenotype. This experiment can be done as a series of weekly laboratory exercises, as an intensive 1-week laboratory project, or as the basis of an extended student research investigation.

AB The profound advances in the biomolecular sciences over the last decades have enabled similar advances in biomedicine. These advances have increasingly challenged our abilities to deploy them in an equitable and ethically acceptable manner. As such, it has become necessary and important to teach biomedical and scientific ethics to our students who will become the researchers, medical professionals, and global citizens of the future. As advances in the biosciences and medicine are made, developed, and used across the globe, our survival on an endangered planet requires global dialog and consensual action. To that end, a group of us from around the world have come together to describe the differing foundations of our ethical beliefs, and how ethical issues in biomedicine and in science are described and confronted in our countries. We hope to show the commonality in our beliefs and practices and to encourage readers from around the world to contribute to a continuing discussion through a new section of the journal, The Global Ethics Corner.

AB A biochemistry course is a fundamental but important subject in medical education in China. In recent years, the number of international medical students has increased. Curriculum reform in biochemistry teaching is needed because of the knowledge limitations of students, a close linkage of biochemical content with clinics, the shortcomings of lecture-centered teaching, and the requirements for early clinical practice training and competence. In this study, we analyzed a novel curriculum reform, Hybrid-PBL, which combined problem-based learning (PBL) with biochemistry lectures and was implemented for biochemical teaching at Dalian Medical University (DMU) in China. The change in curriculum affected 189 international medical students. This study selected two PBL cases concerning the basic biochemical issues of carbohydrate metabolism and liver biochemistry for the analysis, and ten examples of learning issues for each case were reported by the international students. A questionnaire was utilized to evaluate students' perceptions of the Hybrid-PBL, and examination scores were analyzed to assess the curriculum reform in biochemistry teaching. A statistical analysis revealed that the Hybrid-PBL curriculum was well accepted by the international students as an effective supplement to lecture-centered teaching programs. The students obtained more abilities, higher examination scores, and an improved understanding of biomedical information from the Hybrid-PBL program than from conventional teaching methods. Our study was an innovative trial that applied a PBL curriculum to the specific discipline of biochemistry and may provide a potential and promising new teaching method that can be widely utilized.

AB The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm has become one of the core algorithms in bioinformatics; however, this programming requires more suitable explanations for students with different major backgrounds. In supposing sample sequences and using a simple store system, the connection between the exhaustive search method and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm was analyzed to more thoroughly explain this algorithm. The present study could benefit the teaching and learning of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. (c) 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 45(3):194-204, 2017.

AB We explore the integration of societal issues in undergraduate training within the life sciences. Skills in thinking about science, scientific knowledge production and the place of science in society are crucial in the context of the idea of responsible research and innovation. This idea became institutionalized and it is currently well-present in the scientific agenda. Developing abilities in this regard seems particularly relevant to training in the life sciences, as new developments in this area somehow evoke the involvement of all of us citizens, our engagement to debate and take part in processes of change. The present analysis draws from the implementation of a curricular unit focused on science-society dialogue, an optional course included in the Biochemistry Degree study plan offered at the University of Porto. This curricular unit was designed to be mostly an exploratory activity for the students, enabling them to undertake in-depth study in areas/topics of their specific interest. Mapping topics from students' final papers provided a means of analysis and became a useful tool in the exploratory collaborative construction of the course. We discuss both the relevance and the opportunity of thinking and questioning the science-society dialogue. As part of undergraduate training, this pedagogical practice was deemed successful.

AB This work describes a 10-week laboratory project studying wild-type and mutant bacterial alkaline phosphatase, in which students purify, quantitate, and perform kinetic assays on wild-type and selected mutants of the enzyme. Students also perform plasmid DNA purification, digestion, and gel analysis. In addition to simply learning important techniques, students acquire novel biochemical data in their kinetic analysis of mutant enzymes. The experiments are designed to build on students' work from week to week in a way that requires them to apply quantitative analysis and reasoning skills, reinforcing traditional textbook biochemical concepts. Students are assessed through lab reports focused on journal style writing, quantitative and conceptual question sheets, and traditional exams.

AB Medical students build clinical knowledge on the grounds of previously obtained basic knowledge. The study aimed to evaluate the competency of third year medical students to interpret biochemically based clinical scenarios using knowledge and skills gained during year 1 and 2 of undergraduate medical training. Study was conducted on year 3 MBBS students at AIMST University, Malaysia. Clinical scenarios (25) were constructed and administered to student volunteers, making sure at least one question from each system of year 2 was represented. Feedback was obtained on a five-point Likert scale regarding perception of learning biochemistry in MBBS year 1 versus 2. Mean score of test was 18 (72.11%). Performance was comparatively better in questions related to topics learnt in year 1 and reinforced in year 2 compared to those learnt for first time in year 2. In the feedback obtained, 31% strongly agreed and 56% agreed understanding the subject was helped more by learning biochemistry in year 2 than in year 1. Likewise, 36% strongly agreed and 56% agreed appreciating the importance of biochemistry in patient diagnosis was helped more by learning biochemistry in year 2 than year 1. Thirty one percent strongly agreed and 54% agreed that year 1 biochemistry would have been more relevant if case discussions were done simultaneously. Students retain basic science subjects better and appreciate the importance of basic sciences in patient diagnosis if they are reinforced in the context of clinical situations.

AB A project-based biophysical chemistry laboratory course, which is offered to the biochemistry and molecular biology majors in their senior year, is described. In this course, the classroom study of the structure-function of biomolecules is integrated with the discovery-guided laboratory study of these molecules using computer modeling and simulations. In particular, modern computational tools are employed to elucidate the relationship between structure, dynamics, and function in proteins. Computer-based laboratory protocols that we introduced in three modules allow students to visualize the secondary, super-secondary, and tertiary structures of proteins, analyze non-covalent interactions in protein-ligand complexes, develop three-dimensional structural models (homology model) for new protein sequences and evaluate their structural qualities, and study proteins' intrinsic dynamics to understand their functions. In the fourth module, students are assigned to an authentic research problem, where they apply their laboratory skills (acquired in modules 1-3) to answer conceptual biophysical questions. Through this process, students gain in-depth understanding of protein dynamicsthe missing link between structure and function. Additionally, the requirement of term papers sharpens students' writing and communication skills. Finally, these projects result in new findings that are communicated in peer-reviewed journals.

AB Here we present the development of a 13 week project-oriented biochemistry laboratory designed to introduce students to foundational biochemical techniques and then enable students to perform original research projects once they have mastered these techniques. In particular, we describe a semester-long laboratory that focuses on a biomedically relevant enzyme-Helicobacter pylori (Hp) urease-the activity of which is absolutely required for the gastric pathogen Hp to colonize the human stomach. Over the course of the semester, students undertake a biochemical purification of Hp urease, assess the success of their purification, and investigate the activity of their purified enzyme. In the final weeks of the semester, students design and implement their own experiments to study Hp urease. This laboratory provides students with an understanding of the importance of biochemistry in human health while empowering them to engage in an active area of research.

AB A two-part laboratory exercise was developed to enhance classroom instruction on the significance of p53 mutations in cancer development. Students were asked to mine key information from an international database of p53 genetic changes related to cancer, the IARC TP53 database. Using this database, students designed several data mining activities to look at the changes in the p53 gene from a number of perspectives, including potential cancer-causing agents leading to particular changes and the prevalence of certain p53 variations in certain cancers. In addition, students gained a global perspective on cancer prevalence in different parts of the world. Students learned how to use the database in the first part of the exercise, and then used that knowledge to search particular cancers and cancer-causing agents of their choosing in the second part of the exercise. Students also connected the information gathered from the p53 exercise to a previous laboratory exercise looking at risk factors for cancer development. The goal of the experience was to increase student knowledge of the link between p53 genetic variation and cancer. Students also were able to walk a similar path through the website as a cancer researcher using the database to enhance bench work-based experiments with complementary large-scale database p53 variation information.

AB This article describes the transition from a traditional instructor-centered course, based on lectures, to a student-centered course based on active learning methodologies as part of the reform of the Spanish higher education system within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Specifically, we describe the use of active learning methodologies to teach metabolism to students of nutrition and dietetics during the first year of their professional training in a 4-year undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Human Nutrition and Dietetics). In the new course design, the number of didactic lectures was largely reduced and complemented with a series of activities (problems/case studies, discussion workshops, self-assessment quizzes) aimed to get students actively engaged, to encourage self-learning, and to promote sustained work throughout the length of the course. The article presents quantitative data demonstrating a clear and significant improvement in students' performance when an active approach was implemented. Importantly, the improved performance was achieved without work overload. Finally, students' responses to this new teaching methodology have been very positive and overall satisfaction high. In summary, our results strongly argue in favor of the teaching model described herein. (c) 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 41(3):131-138, 2013

AB The TRIPSE (tri-partite problem solving exercise), a process-oriented exam that mimics the scientific process, was used previously in small classes (15-25). Provided limited data, students frame explanations and design experimental tests that they later revise with additional information. Our 6-year experience using it with larger numbers (155-204) in a freshman biology course, suggests that it could provide a means of assessing individual student performance. Students rated the learning value of this experience to be significantly higher than a standard MCQ on a 10-point scale (TRIPSEs 8.2, CI 8.1/8.4 vs. MCQs 4.9, CI 4.8/5.1, n = 712). Additionally, we tested one cohort (n = 146) with a group TRIPSE (groups of 6), and found that this variant also provided a valuable learning experience (8.0, CI 7.7/8.3).

AB The process of photosynthesis is central to science curriculum at all levels. This article describes an inquiry-based laboratory investigation developed to explore the impact of light quality on photosynthesis and to connect this process to current research on harvesting solar energy, including bioenergy, artificial photosynthesis, and solar cells. This laboratory was used with high-school science teachers who then took this experience back to their classrooms. During this exercise, teachers used an economical spectroradiometer to measure the solar spectrum and relate this to photosynthetic light absorption by determining the quality of light beneath trees. Following this investigation, teachers learned about the plant-inspired dye-sensitized solar cells and constructed one. To connect their light quality investigation to the efficiency of photosynthesis and solar cells, teachers then collected data at locations with varying quality and intensity of light. In sum, this investigation provides a crucial connection between photosynthesis and cutting edge research on solar energy technologies. Our learning experience provides a new instructional model for understanding a little investigated aspect of photosynthesis and connects to authentic scientific research.

AB Current cutting-edge biomedical investigation requires that the researcher have an operational understanding of several diverse disciplines. Biocatalysis is a field of science that operates at the crossroads of organic chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology, and provides an excellent model for interdisciplinary research. We have developed an inquiry-based module that uses the mutagenesis of the yeast reductase, YDL124w, to study the bioorganic synthesis of the taxol side-chain, a pharmacologically important molecule. Using related structures, students identify regions they think will affect enzyme stereoselective, design and generate site-specific mutants, and then characterize the effect of these changes on enzyme activity. This laboratory activity gives our students experience, working in a scientific discipline outside of biology and exposes them to techniques and equipment they do not normally work with in a molecular biology course. These inter-disciplinary experiences not only show the relevance of other sciences to biology, but also give our students the ability to communicate more effectively with scientists outside their discipline.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The Federation of Asian and Oceanian Biochemists and Molecular Biologists (FAOBMB) and the College of Biochemists of Sri Lanka (CBSL) organized a virtual education symposium in 2021 funded by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). The parallel session named "Students' Perception" was attended by 188 participants from 11 countries. The main objectives of this session were to aggregate participants' viewpoints on aspects of virtual education, including innovative strategies to enhance motivation and engagement of students, improving teacher-student and student-student interactions, managing stress, and virtual learning platforms. Data were collected via rapporteurs from multiple segments of the session including a mini-introductory talk, poll, role play, and discussions about outstanding student experiences, types of virtual platforms, innovative methods of teaching, student motivation and stress management. The importance of student perception and issues like technological difficulties and the reluctance of students to engage were discussed. In addition to well-established strategies such as using polls, chat box features, and discussions in breakout rooms, participants also proposed exciting learning methods to engage students such as quizzes, competitions and challenges, engagement of multiple sensory modalities, story-based learning, and so forth. This report provides anecdotal evidence on pedagogies described in textbooks and also introduces new ideas based on this existing foundation. Future research should aim to harmonize virtual education with traditional classroom methods and explore innovative virtual tools like avatar-based universities, virtual labs, and user-friendly online assessment platforms. The results apply to all disciplines, and not exclusively to biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB).

AB High school science fairs provide an exceptional opportunity for students to gain experience with scientific research, and participation has positive outcomes with respect to chosen careers in the sciences. However, it can be challenging to engage high school students in university-level research outside of formal internship programs. Here, we describe an experimental pipeline for a computational structural biology project that engages high school students. Students are involved at every step of the investigation and utilize freely available software to dock inhibitors onto protein homologues, and then analyze the resulting complexes. Bacterial sortases are transpeptidases on the cell surface of Gram-positive bacteria and are a potential target for the development of antibiotics. Students modeled inhibitors bound to sortases from several organisms, asking questions about affinity and selectivity. Their project was ranked in the top 10% at both regional and state science fairs. This project design is easily adaptable to countless other protein systems and provides a pipeline for collaborative high school student/university professor inquiry.

AB After the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increasing demand for remote learning and an expansion in the substitution of traditional practical sessions with lab-based virtual tools. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of virtual labs in practicing biochemical experiments and to examine the student's feedback regarding this tool. Virtual and traditional labs training were compared in teaching qualitative analysis of proteins and carbohydrates experiments for first-year medical students. Students' achievements were assessed, and their satisfaction regarding virtual labs was estimated using a questionnaire. A total of 633 students were enrolled in the study. There was a significant increase in the average scores of students performing the virtual lab of protein analysis compared with those trained in a real lab and those who watched videos explaining the experiment (p < 0.001). The opposite was noticed in the qualitative analysis of carbohydrates with significantly high grades of students trained conventionally compared with those who practiced with virtual labs (p < 0.001). Students' feedback rates on the virtual labs were high (> 70% satisfaction rate). Most students believed virtual labs were supported with a clear explanation, yet they thought it did not give a realistic experience. Students accepted virtual labs, but they still prefer using them as preparatory to classic labs. In conclusion, virtual labs can offer good laboratory practice in the Medical Biochemistry course. Their impact on students' learning might be increased if selected cautiously and implemented properly in the curriculum.

AB With rapid development of sequencing technology and the continuous accumulation of biological big data, people who are capable of using bioinformatic skills to analyze omics data and work out biological problems are urgently needed in the workforce, which highlights the importance of developing bioinformatics skills early in the undergraduate curriculum. Meanwhile, course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) courses have been proved to be an effective teaching format that have many advantages over traditional labs and lectures. Here we introduced an implementation of CURE course of bioinformatics data analysis and visualization for undergraduate students in major of bioinformatics and evaluated the learning outcomes. We were able to address 10 out of 15 core competencies identified by Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education. Besides, results evaluated by Laboratory Course Assessment Survey demonstrated the goals of collaboration, discovery and relevance, and iteration were accomplished in our course. Meanwhile, a significant increase in scores of final examinations and a long-term improvement on students' research ability on bioinformatics data analysis and visualization were also observed. In summary, this CURE course is useful for undergraduate students learning related knowledge and participate in authentic research in the field of bioinformatics.

AB Stem cell therapy has recently progressed from the preclinical to the early clinical trial arena for a variety of diseases. Moreover, the medical students lack the deep and full understanding of its significance and potential as the promising future cure for diverse diseases worldwide. This study aims at evaluating the knowledge, awareness, and perception of medical students as far as stem cells applications are related in the medical field. A cross-sectional survey was carried out using online questionnaires, which were distributed via e-mail to cover all medical faculties in Jordan. The data show that medical students are supportive of using stem cells and their therapeutic applications, and most of them are willing and enthusiastically want to improve their knowledge about stem cells; however, due to the tight schedule and the lack of an elective course about stem cells in the curriculum, many of them are not ready to undergo further training in regenerative medicine unless it becomes part of the assigned training and part of the learning objectives for medical students. These findings indicated the need to update the medical school curriculum with new hits in medicine and expand the range of courses offered for medical students so they can be up-to-date with the quick advances in different medical disciplines.

AB An integrated laboratory experiment was designed for introducing biochemistry students to basic static biochemistry to deepen their understanding on the properties and analysis of biomolecules such as total carbohydrates, lipid, protein, and protein-constituent amino acids. Food represents a very important source of biomolecules of technological and functional interest; therefore, 15 types of food samples were selected to demonstrate the analysis of basic composition of these biomolecules. In this experiment, students learnt testing the total carbohydrates of all the food samples using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method, while performing acid hydrolysis. Then, lipid extraction was done using Soxhlet extraction method in order to determine the crude lipid concentration in different samples. After this, the students learnt testing crude protein content of these samples by using Kjeldahl method, and amino acid analysis was performed using HPLC. From the experiments, students grasped the concept and advantages of these methods and deepened their understanding on compositional analysis of different food samples. This laboratory exercise can be included into any college-level biochemistry courses and gives hands-on experience to the students for conducting scientific research in the field of life sciences, food science, and other bio-related fields.

AB The employability of science graduates if of key concern. Employers report that STEM graduates lack appropriate employability skills and work experience, and science graduates take longer to find full-time work than graduates from many other programs. Undergraduate research experience (URE) is an important pedagogy that involves student immersion in a professional research environment-as such it provides an opportunity for science students to develop their understanding of the world of work, and of their own developing employability. In this study, we examine students' reflections on their URE learnings and their resultant perceived employability. We ask whether students understand the value of the URE as an employability development vehicle and consider what can be done to improve the employability learnings from the URE. The results show that students articulate multiple learnings from their UREs, but they struggle to translate these learnings into an employability or non-research-work context. We conclude that UREs are important opportunities to learn about work in science, but that URE students would benefit from URE curriculum components that foreground the way UREs can help develop students' employability. The insights from this study can help inform and refine future URE programs to improve their efficacy as vehicles to benefit graduate employability.

TI Student design and characterization of visible DHFR fusions for

ID ESCHERICHIA-COLI; FLUORESCENT PROTEINS
AB Student feedback from an undergraduate biochemistry lab course suggested the use of visibly traceable proteins may assist learning. Based on this feedback, we used guided inquiry lab exercises where students developed and characterized a suite of fluorescent protein-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusions as tools for a biochemistry teaching lab. In contrast to the unfused versions, members of this suite are well-expressed, soluble, visible, highly stable, and easily characterized. The color of mCherry and EGFP fluorescent fusions with microbial DHFR allows students to visibly track their target protein from expression through purification under ambient light, while fusions with BFP are visible under UV-light. Fusions were made to both wild-type and kinetically enhanced DHFR variants. Importantly, we found that fluorescent protein fusions with DHFR did not kinetically interfere as the K-M and k(cat) values were not remarkably altered from the unfused variant. With these fusions, students can easily measure kinetic parameters under steady-state conditions with readily available substrate and common laboratory spectrophotometers. Additionally, students also determined IC50 values of trimethoprim for DHFR. These exercises can be completed in a series of up to six lab periods and we have included the protocols for instructors who wish undertake a similar series of experiments in their biochemistry teaching labs. Using these visible fusion enzymes with subsequent students, we observed potential learning gains on a course assessment and received positive student feedback. We suggest that the often over-looked element of visual cues in a biochemistry lab may be an exploitable component of learning.

AB Education in biochemistry teaching laboratories focus primarily on applying biochemical techniques to understanding human disease, biochemistry, and biotechnology. With anthropogenic climate change, there is a renewed interest in quantifying biodiversity, especially with the use of molecular-based approaches such as DNA barcoding. This 3-week laboratory exercise allowed undergraduate students to explore DNA sequencing, analysis, and DNA barcoding. Students extracted DNA from insect legs and amplified a 650 bp section of Cytochrome C oxidase I gene by PCR, and confirmed the success of their PCR by DNA gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were submitted for sequencing and students analyzed the sequences using FinchTV, Genbank, and the Barcode of Life Database. Based on the DNA sequences of their PCR products students were able to identify the species of insects. This lab exercise provides a different context to introducing students to analyzing DNA sequences and using DNA databases.

AB The real time PCR (qPCR) method provides a powerful method to assess levels of particular species of DNA. When combined with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) it is the predominate technique to measure expression of gene transcripts. While this approach is very powerful, particular care must be taken in the design of the primers to facilitate specific and sensitive detection. Herein describes the framework for an undergraduate assignment which aims to teach primer design for SYBR based RT-qPCR. Beyond gaining direct experience with primer design, students will gain familiarity with important bioinformatic resources as well as a deeper theoretical understanding of the RT-qPCR approach and potential limitations. Moreover, as students' progress through the assignment they re-encounter many important concepts in molecular biology, gene expression, and nucleic acids, creating an opportunity for spiral learning. As this exercise only requires access to free web-based resources and does not require a laboratory it can be used in most science education settings. Despite not being a wet lab, this is a highly authentic research experience as this design process is commonplace in a molecular biology laboratory. Furthermore, the assignment is highly adaptable for different learning outcomes, time frames, and student background and ability. This article seeks to highlight connections and expanded learning outcomes for those already teaching such material, as well as a step-by-step guide for those new to teaching such content.

We consider the need to develop digital and creative fluencies in our students and the importance of creativity and visualization in learning science. The potential of virtual reality (VR) platforms to complement these goals are discussed with a number of examples. Finally, we look into the future where to see how VR might fit into a future curriculum.

AB The use of online platform to conduct teaching and learning activities has becoming a new norm for teachers and students during this COVID-19 outbreak. In this commentary, we share our experiences of using online conferencing platform to promote active and interactive learning among students. We also suggest approaches that teachers can use to design their teaching and learning activities by employing reciprocal teaching as a way to engage students online instead of using the platform for didactic teaching by the teacher. The proposed strategy is applicable and transferable to other domains.

AB A simple, repeatable and inexpensive laboratory practice applied to teach and discuss aquatic metal pollution and oxidative stress detoxification mechanisms through biomarker analyses, as well as important ecotoxicology concepts, is presented herein. It has been implemented in a university in Brazil to both undergraduate and Master's and PhD students, indicating usefulness to all these levels. Students learned to detect metallothionein and reduced glutathione concentrations in biological samples and investigate several variables of interest in biomonitoring assessments. In addition, statistical correlations were used to indicate the potential dual role played by MT in aquatic organisms, allowing for biological inferences regarding both aquatic metal pollution and oxidative stress detoxification mechanisms and maturing of ecotoxicological and biomonitoring concepts discussed and presented both theoretically and integrated to the laboratory findings.

AB Undergraduate laboratory courses, owing to their larger sizes and shorter time slots, are often conducted in highly structured modes. However, this approach is known to interfere with students' engagement in the experiments. To enhance students' engagement, we propose an alternative mode of running laboratory courses by creating some "disorder" in a previously adopted structure. After performing an experiment in the right way, the students were asked to repeat the experiment but with a variation at certain steps leading to the experiment being done the "wrong" way. Although this approach led to fewer experiments being conducted in a semester, it significantly enhanced the students' involvement. This was also reflected in the students' feedback. The majority of students preferred repeating an experiment with a variant protocol than performing a new experiment. Although we have tested this inquiry-based approach only for an undergraduate laboratory course in molecular biology, we believe such an approach could also be extended to undergraduate laboratory courses of other subjects.

AB Proteins must interact with a variety of other cellular components to properly perform their functions. We have developed a series of five experiments based on the robust bacterial single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) to characterize both known and unknown protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Students work in groups to generate and process data from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), yeast two-hybrid, far Western, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and fluorescence microscopy experiments, including choosing a novel condition for each. A gamification approach was used to encourage student participation and laboratory safety. Student learning was assessed using pre- and post-surveys and course grade data. The results indicate a clear increase in both content knowledge and confidence in the topics presented. Ranking of course activities indicated that performing the hands-on laboratory exercises was the most valuable course component, and over half of the students would choose to take another course with a similar gamification component. Each of the five laboratory experiments can be performed in combination with each other or integrated separately into a related course, and the gamification structure can be applied to any course.

AB One of the well-accepted ways of introducing undergraduates to the method of scientific inquiry is to introduce them to primary literature. A matter of concern is that undergraduate students of Indian universities are generally not trained to read primary literature. We combined traditional teaching and student-centered approach in a 3-day module for introducing first-year students to critical reading of primary literature. This article describes the design of the module, the method of assessment of student performance, the learning outcomes, and student feedback. We received positive feedback from students and observed significant improvement in their understanding of the rationale and results of the research paper under consideration. The module may be viewed as an example of a simple introductory activity to enthuse and initiate college students to scientific thinking and research paper reading.

AB Genomics is a core course for bioscience-majored undergraduates in many universities. However, the teaching of genomics faces many challenges such as the need for rapid updating of related knowledge, content overlap between genomics and molecular biology, lack of motivation of students in the traditional passive classroom-learning model, the difficulty of presenting omics data analysis processes through lectures, and the challenges of developing the research abilities of senior students. Here we report our updated genomics course design and the teaching practices we used to address these issues, including: use of the presentation-assimilation-discussion (PAD) pedagogy and opportunities for students to practice real data analysis and intensive reading of research papers. The resultant positive outcomes and problems are also discussed. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2019.

AB Understanding the relationship between molecular structure and function represents an important goal of undergraduate life sciences. Although evidence suggests that handling physical models supports gains in student understanding of structure-function relationships, such models have not been widely implemented in biochemistry classrooms. Three-dimensional (3D) printing represents an emerging cost-effective means of producing molecular models to help students investigate structure-function concepts. We developed three interactive learning modules with dynamic 3D printed models to help biochemistry students visualize biomolecular structures and address particular misconceptions. These modules targeted specific learning objectives related to DNA and RNA structure, transcription factor-DNA interactions, and DNA supercoiling dynamics. We also designed accompanying assessments to gauge student learning. Students responded favorably to the modules and showed normalized learning gains of 49% with respect to their ability to understand and relate molecular structures to biochemical functions. By incorporating accurate 3D printed structures, these modules represent a novel advance in instructional design for biomolecular visualization. We provide instructors with the materials necessary to incorporate each module in the classroom, including instructions for acquiring and distributing the models, activities, and assessments.

AB We developed a hands-on course in molecular biology for undergraduate underrepresented in medicine (URM) students. To incentivize student preparation for team-based learning (TBL) activities, we implemented a novel grading schema that requires a minimum individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) score to share the team group readiness assurance test (gRAT) score. Fifty-one students participated in this 2-year study and were divided in teams of five or six students that worked throughout the course on a unique, hands-on project and also participated in TBL exercises. In the laboratory sessions, students isolated RNA from cultured neuronal cells, synthesized complementary DNA (cDNA), and used gene sequencing to identify a gene relevant in human health and disease. Student participation in TBL was quantified and correlated with performance on individual iRATs and the course final examination. We found that implementation of the novel incentive structure lowered the variance of TBL scores (iRAT and gRAT) and strengthened the correlation between final examination scores and either iRAT scores or percentage participation in TBL. Subgroup analysis showed that with the new grading schema, stronger students benefited more from the gRAT exercises, while more poorly performing students were better helped by individual preparation prior to the iRAT exercise. A combination of two active learning strategies, TBL and hands-on sessions, may strengthen student acquisition of course content and promote teamwork skills. The new incentive structure seems to reduce the disparity in knowledge amongst our students as demonstrated by the reduced iRAT and gRAT score variances.

AB Cell and developmental processes are complex, and profoundly dependent on spatial relationships that change over time. Innovative educational or teaching strategies are always needed to foster deep comprehension of these processes and their dynamic features. However, laboratory exercises in cell and developmental biology at the undergraduate level do not often take into account the time dimension. In this article, we provide a laboratory exercise focused in cell migration, aiming to stimulate thinking in time and space dimensions through a simplification of more complex processes occurring in cell or developmental biology. The use of open-source tools for the analysis, as well as the whole package of raw results (available at http://github.com/danielprieto/keratocyte) make it suitable for its implementation in courses with very diverse budgets.
   Aiming to facilitate the student's transition from science-students to science-practitioners we propose an exercise of scientific thinking, and an evaluation method. This in turn is communicated here to facilitate the finding of common caveats and weaknesses in the process of producing simple scientific communications describing the results achieved.

AB The molecular structure of living organisms and the complex interactions amongst its components are the basis for the diversity observed at the macroscopic level. Proteins and nucleic acids are some of the major molecular components, and play a key role in several biological functions, such as those of development and evolution. This article presents an educational, bioinformatics-based process, designed to enhance a better understanding of the structure of the above molecules. In addition, by using selected protein molecules, it attempts to clarify protein organization levels and how these are related with the structural and functional diversity, which define the biodiversity of living organisms at the macroscopic level. In the framework of this project, molecular modeling has been performed using the Cn3D software, created by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Cn3D is a user friendly application, which is easy for students to get familiar with quickly. Our suggested process may be easily enriched by a multitude of protein, nucleic acid, or other molecule structures, which are freely accessible at NCBI website. The described process has been implemented by students (n=225) of the 5th high school grade, in two high schools in Greece.

DE visual literacy; active learning; multimedia instruction; undergraduate

AB Figure analysis is a novel active learning teaching technique that reinforces visual literacy. Small groups of students discuss diagrams in class in order to learn content. The instructor then gives a brief introduction and later summarizes the content of the figure. This teaching technique can be used in place of lecture as a mechanism to deliver information to students. Here, a how to guide is presented in the form of an in-class dialogue, displaying the difficulties in visual interpretation that some students may experience while figure analysis is being implemented in an upper-level, cell biology course. Additionally, the dialogue serves as a guide for instructors who may implement the active learning technique as they consider how to respond to students' concerns in class.

AB Enzyme-substrate interactions are a fundamental concept of biochemistry that is built upon throughout multiple biochemistry courses. Central to understanding enzyme-substrate interactions is specific knowledge of exactly how an enzyme and substrate interact. Within this narrower topic, students must understand the various binding sites on an enzyme and be able to reason from simplistic lock and key or induced fit models to the more complex energetics model of transition state theory. Learning to understand these many facets of enzyme-substrate interactions and reasoning from multiple models present challenges where students incorrectly make connections between concepts or make no connection at all. This study investigated biochemistry students' understanding of enzyme-substrate interactions through the use of clinical interviews and a national administration (N=707) of the Enzyme-Substrate Interactions Concept Inventory. Findings include misconceptions regarding the nature of enzyme-substrate interactions, naive ideas about the active site, a lack of energetically driven interactions, and an incomplete understanding of the specificity pocket.

AB Evolution is a defining criterion of life and is central to understanding biological systems. However, the timescale of evolutionary shifts in phenotype limits most classroom evolution experiments to simple probability simulations. In vitro directed evolution (IVDE) frequently serves as a model system for the study of Darwinian evolution but produces noticeable phenotypic shifts in a matter of hours. An IVDE demonstration lab would serve to both directly demonstrate how Darwinian selection can act on a pool of variants and introduce students to an essential method of modern molecular biology. To produce an IVDE demonstration lab, continuous IVDE of a T500 ribozyme ligase population has been paired with a fluorescent strand displacement reporter system to visualize the selection of improved catalytic function. A ribozyme population is taken through rounds of isothermal amplification dependent on the self-ligation of a T7 promoter. As the population is selectively enriched with better ligase activity, the strand displacement system allows for the monitoring of the population's ligation rate. The strand displacement reporter system permits the detection of ligated ribozyme. Once ligated with the T7 promoter, the 5 end of the ribozyme displaces paired fluorophore-quencher oligonucleotides, in turn, generating visible signal upon UV light excitation. As the ligation rate of the population increases, due to the selection for faster ligating species, the fluorescent signal develops more rapidly. The pairing of the continuous isothermal system with the fluorescent reporting scheme allows any user, provided with minimal materials, to model the continuous directed evolution of a biomolecule.

AB Biochemistry occupies a unique place in the medical school curricula, but the teaching of biochemistry presents certain challenges. One of these challenges is facilitating students' interest in and mastery of metabolism. The many pathways and modes of regulation can be overwhelming for students to learn and difficult for professors to teach in an engaging manner. The first chapter of the metabolism section in current Chinese biochemistry textbooks covers carbohydrate metabolism. Medical students usually complain about the difficulty of this subject. Here we discuss how to facilitate learning by rearranging the subjects in this introductory chapter of biochemical metabolism and to lay a solid foundation for future study. The strategy involves reorganizing the order in which subjects are taught from simple to complex and from short to long metabolic pathways. Most students taking the curriculum consider that the strategy engages their learning interests in biochemistry and enhances their learning outcomes.

AB We used the Integrated Microbial Genomes Annotation Collaboration Toolkit as a framework to incorporate microbial genomics research into a microbiology and biochemistry course in a way that promoted student learning of bioinformatics and research skills and emphasized teamwork and collaboration as evidenced through multiple assessment mechanisms. Student teams in microbiology used bioinformatics tools to identify and characterize gene products from Mucilaginibacter paludis necessary for the synthesis of specific amino acids and then designed and carried out growth experiments to determine if the organism could indeed synthesize the amino acids. Students in biochemistry worked to characterize one of the amino acid biosynthetic pathways reconstructed by a previous microbiology class through amplification and cloning of the M. paludis genes and complementation analysis of Escherichia coli mutants.

AB Research that has focused on external representations in biochemistry has uncovered student difficulties in comprehending and interpreting external representations. This study focuses on students' understanding of three external representations (ribbon diagram, wireframe, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic) of the potassium ion channel protein. Analysis of the interview data demonstrates that students were able to use the ribbon structures and polarity of the cell membrane to help support claims about the protein's orientation and interactions within the cell membrane. Students expressed fragmented understandings of the interactions between the potassium ion and the aqueous solution outside/inside of the cell membrane. Suggestions for instruction are to probe student understanding to help students activate prior knowledge and to help them build a more connected set of concepts pertaining to protein structure and function.

AB This laboratory exercise introduces students to concepts in recombinant DNA technology while accommodating a major semester project in protein purification, structure, and function in a biochemistry laboratory for junior- and senior-level undergraduate students. It is also suitable for forensic science courses focused in DNA biology and advanced high school biology classes. Students begin by examining a plasmid map with the goal of identifying which restriction enzymes may be used to clone a piece of foreign DNA containing a gene of interest into the vector. From the National Center for Biotechnology Initiative website, students are instructed to retrieve a protein sequence and use Expasy's Reverse Translate program to reverse translate the protein to cDNA. Students then use Integrated DNA Technologies' OligoAnalyzer to predict the complementary DNA strand and obtain DNA recognition sequences for the desired restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs' website. Students add the appropriate DNA restriction sequences to the double-stranded foreign DNA for cloning into the plasmid and infecting Escherichia coli cells. Students are introduced to computational biology tools, molecular biology terminology and the process of DNA cloning in this valuable single session, in silico experiment. This project develops students' understanding of the cloning process as a whole and contrasts with other laboratory and internship experiences in which the students may be involved in only a piece of the cloning process/techniques. Students interested in pursuing postgraduate study and research or employment in an academic biochemistry or molecular biology laboratory or industry will benefit most from this experience.

AB The pace of discovery in biochemistry and genetics and its effect on clinical medicine places new curricular challenges in medical school education. We sought to evaluate students' understanding of neurogenetics and its clinical applications to design a pilot curriculum into the clinical neurology clerkship. We utilized a needs assessment and a written examination to evaluate the genetics knowledge of 81 third- and fourth-year medical students. The needs assessment surveyed students' self-perceptions of their own understanding of basic and clinically related genetic principles and clinical skills, as well as the most effective educational methods. Medical students reported more competence with basic science learned during the preclinical years than clinical concepts, and they demonstrated relatively low knowledge levels in clinical neurogenetics concepts on the examination, with an average of 29% correct on questions pertaining to genetic counseling compared with 82% correct with regard to inheritance patterns. Common, cross-specialty clinical skills were attained (e.g. internet search, family histories), while at least half of students reported minimal understanding or awareness of key genetics websites (e. g. OMIM) and indications for support group recommendations and genetics referrals. Teaching these more specific genetics skills and concepts needs to be emphasized in the clinical curriculum.

AB Recently, both science and technology faculty have been recognizing biological research competencies that are valued but rarely assessed. Some of these valued learning outcomes include scientific methods and thinking, critical assessment of primary papers, quantitative reasoning, communication, and putting biological research into a historical and broader social context. This article presents examples of Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) assignments that illustrate a computer-assisted method to help students achieve biological research competencies. A new release of CPR is appropriate for engaging students online in reading and writing about investigations. A participant perception inventory was designed for use as a repeated measure to discriminate among beginning, middle, and ending student perceptions. Examples are provided to demonstrate how to assess student perceptions of what they gain from instruction related to science research competencies. Results suggest that students in a large enrollment class consider CPR to be useful for helping them learn about quantitative and categorical research variables; the use of the experimental method to test ideas; the use of controls; analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data; and how to critically read primary papers.

AB The positive relationship between lecture attendance and academic outcomes may be changing in the era of lecturing recordings. The objective of the study was to test this and to determine whether it varied between student cohorts. Consenting students in biochemistry from pharmacy, biomedical science, medical laboratory science, and nutrition programs, which had access to lecture recordings, signed in when attending lectures. Attendance was related to academic outcomes by regression analysis. Average attendance was low (=19%) and declined significantly between years for most weeks. The students who attended =50% of lectures (=17%) had higher marks than those that attended <50%. Overall regression analysis showed there were positive associations between most academic outcomes and lecture attendance or engagement (attendance and lecture recording access). However, these associations were weak or moderate for students in the pharmacy and biomedical science programs and were not apparent for students in the medical laboratory science and nutrition programs. In a separate survey, the most common reason for attending lectures was "I think I learn more by attending" and for not attending, was "Work commitments made it difficult to get to lectures." The main conclusion is that students of biochemistry should be encouraged to attend lectures, as the limited evidence suggests that attendance may still be associated with better academic outcomes and that some students find them beneficial.

ID FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; PERCEPTION
AB Online assessments are needed during the prevailing pandemic situation to continue educational activities while ensuring safety. After conducting the online practical assessment (OPrA) in Biochemistry, we analyzed the students' responses. The blueprint of the OPrA was prepared by the faculty, referring to the various levels and domains of Bloom's taxonomy. Four components were chosen for the online assessment: digital spotters, enumerating the steps of objective structured practical examination, interpretation of quantitative estimation, and case discussion. Each faculty assessed about 12-13 students in separate breakout rooms over 15-20 min on all four components. Feedback on the conduct of the examination was collected from the students and faculty anonymously and analyzed. Out of the 200 students who attended the online assessment, only one scored less than 50%, majority of them scored between 71% and 90%. Under the individual exercises, the average score of students in "Spotters " was 9.8 out of 10; in "OSPE, " 8.7 out of 10; in "Quantitative experiments, " 15.2 out of 20 and in "Case discussion, " 22.4 out of 30. Around 20% had previous experience attending the OPrA. They differed in their opinion from the rest of the students on five aspects; time allotted for the assessment (p value = 0.02, chi(2) = 5.07), students using unfair means during the online viva (p value = 0.02, chi(2) = 5.57), their computing skills (p value = 0.001, chi(2) = 19.82), their performance (p value = 0.001, chi(2) = 8.84), and overall conduct of the examination (p value = 0.001, chi(2) = 15.55). OPrA tools may be designed referring to Bloom's taxonomy, and prior exposure to the online tools may benefit the students.

AB Transcription is the critical first step in expressing a gene, during which an RNA polymerase (RNAP) synthesizes an RNA copy of one strand of the DNA that encodes a gene. Here we describe a laboratory experiment that uses a single assay to probe two important steps in transcription: (1) RNAP binding to DNA, and (2) the transcriptional activity of the polymerase. Students probe both these steps in a single experiment using a fluorescence-based electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and commercially available Escherichia coli RNAP. As an inquiry-driven component, students add the transcriptional inhibitor rifampicin to reactions and draw conclusions about its mechanism of inhibition by determining whether it blocks polymerase binding to DNA or transcriptional activity. Depending on the curriculum and learning goals of individual courses, this experimental module could be easily expanded to include additional experimentation that mimics a research environment more closely. After completing the experiment students understand basic principles of transcription, mechanisms of inhibition, and the use of EMSAs to probe protein/DNA interactions.

AB Communication and collaboration are key science competencies that support sharing of scientific knowledge with experts and non-experts alike. On the one hand, they facilitate interdisciplinary conversations between students, educators, and researchers, while on the other they improve public awareness, enable informed choices, and impact policy decisions. Herein, we describe an interdisciplinary undergraduate course focused on using data from various bioinformatics data resources to explore the molecular underpinnings of diabetes mellitus (Types 1 and 2) and introducing students to science communication. Building on course materials and original student-generated artifacts, a series of collaborative activities engaged students, educators, researchers, healthcare professionals and community members in exploring, learning about, and discussing the molecular bases of diabetes. These collaborations generated novel educational materials and approaches to learning and presenting complex ideas about major global health challenges in formats accessible to diverse audiences.

ID PROGRAM
AB Undergraduate laboratory courses are vital for both enhancing student learning and preparing students for their future careers. Despite their importance, laboratory courses are often met with a lack of enthusiasm from students. For pre-health students specifically, laboratory courses are commonly seen as part of a check-list that needs to be completed in order to achieve future education or a career, instead of seeing the information that is taught in laboratories as essential preparation. A one-semester biochemistry laboratory module was designed to demonstrate the real-life applications of experimental techniques. This laboratory module introduced students to common clinical measurements and included learning metabolite analysis through hands-on experiments, connections to simulated patient visits, generation of a research question, and implementation of a student-designed independent experiment. Surveys indicate that this approach was helpful in creating a greater understanding of the applicability of undergraduate laboratory concepts appealing specifically to pre-health students. Additionally, students found this module to provide a variety of gained benefits, knowledge, and confidence in performing scientific techniques. The outcomes of this laboratory module indicate its success and potential to be used in curricula as an effective way to engage pre-health students in an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory.

AB Cancer databases collect original cancer studies and patient clinical information into one site that allows for global analysis. While many courses focus on cancer, few utilize these powerful cancer databases. Our goal was to create a lab experience in which students could explore original cancer study databases, looking at the expression and incidence of driver mutations of cancer. First, the students focus on a specific patient including demographic data and type of cancer. Then the students analyze mRNA expression levels associated with mutations of the gene, determining if it is a tumor suppressor or oncogene. Students also learn which mutations are actionable and how they affect survival. In summary, this module allows students to analyze global trends in driver mutations in cancers and dive into specific patient features.

AB The Covid-19 pandemic has inspired the implementation of a number of online educational activities designed to promote appropriate measures, such as social distancing, in order to avoid spread of the disease. In these circumstances, ensuring that extracurricular activities in science education adapt to the changing situation is of crucial importance. Recognizing the important role high school science olympiads play in science education, we organized an in-person socially distanced 2-day examination for the final round of the Armenian National Biology Olympiad by using Classmarker, a web-based in-browser tool for administering exams. We believe that our experience with organizing this event will prove useful to other educators faced with uncertainty regarding the return to pre-pandemic modes of instruction.

AB Team-based learning (TBL), which encourages students to become active rather than passive learners, has gained world-wide popularity in medical education due to its proven positive effect on more than one aspect of the educational process. At King Abdulaziz University (KAU), clinical biochemistry is still taught in the form of didactic lectures, and while there is a need for introducing active learning, student learning response from TBL has not been explored. In this quasi-experimental non-equivalent comparison group design, we compared learning outcomes and student satisfaction in a clinical biochemistry course taught either via TBL to second year clinical nutrition students (n = 33) or via traditional lectures to same year nursing students (n = 70). The same summative post-course exam was given to both student groups to assess impact on learning. Focus group discussion and a self-administered questionnaire were used to gain insight into clinical nutrition students' level of satisfaction with TBL. In the post-course exam results of recall and reasoning questions, nursing students (Lectures) scored an average of 38% +/- 2.4 in the recall questions while clinical nutrition students (TBL) scored higher with an average of 74.5% +/- 4.3 (p < .0001). In reasoning questions, nursing students (Lectures) scored lower than clinical nutrition students (TBL), 23% +/- 2.7 versus 40% +/- 4.2, respectively (p < .001). In comparing results of pre- and post-test recall questions within each group, there was no significant difference between pre- and post-results for nursing students (Lectures) while clinical nutrition students (TBL) showed a significant increase in post-versus pre-test results of 71% versus 41% (p < .0001). In the final summative post-course exam, nursing students scored an average of 60% +/- 2.4 while clinical nutrition students (TBL) scored significantly higher with an average of 78% +/- 2.4 (p < .001). Qualitative studies revealed that accountability and team-work were positive aspects perceived by students regarding TBL. The study showed that 84% of surveyed students enjoyed the experience, however, when asked about challenges self-study was their main challenge. TBL proved to be a successful, learner-centered approach for clinical nutrition students at KAU in their clinical biochemistry course resulting in improved learning outcomes and higher student satisfaction when compared with traditional didactic methods of teaching.

ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH; MOTIVATION
AB The transition to online learning in spring 2020 was abrupt for both students and instructors. While many instructors moved to asynchronous classes, some institutions relied more heavily on synchronous online courses. Here, we evaluate student perceptions of an inquiry-based molecular biology lecture and lab course following this transition by comparing student survey responses from spring 2019, when the lecture and lab were fully in person, to spring 2020, when the lecture and lab started in person before transitioning to a synchronous online format. Students were asked to identify the main factors that supported their learning in lecture and lab, characterize the main barriers to learning in those courses, and discuss their preference of having an inquiry-based lab or a traditional "cookbook" lab with pre-determined answers. We coded these responses and provide one of the first studies to examine the impact of this online transition on student perceptions of learning in an inquiry-based molecular biology lecture and lab course.

AB The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a case that can be used as a biochemistry learning resource in relation to the topic of viruses. Learning to use cases will be effective if students are assigned to produce reports, articles, or other scientific papers. Self-assessment can be used to assess the competencies that have been learnt in the writing process. This study aims to analyze the scientific papers and self-assessment of students using the COVID-19 pandemic case. It includes qualitative research with scientific paper and self-assessment questionnaire analyses. The research sample was chemistry education study program students (N= 57) following biochemistry course, out of a population of 87 students. The results show that the students have a good understanding of explaining COVID-19. Self-assessment analysis shows that 80% of the students responded positively to eight statements; those who gave positive responses to each questionnaire statement were able to produce scientific papers. Good self-assessment is in line with the ability of students to compile good scientific papers.

AB While molecular visualization has been recognized as a threshold concept in biology education, the explicit assessment of students' visual literacy skills is rare. To facilitate the evaluation of this fundamental ability, a series of NSF-IUSE-sponsored workshops brought together a community of faculty engaged in creating instruments to assess students' biomolecular visualization skills. These efforts expanded our earlier work in which we created a rubric describing overarching themes, learning goals, and learning objectives that address student progress toward biomolecular visual literacy. Here, the BioMolViz Steering Committee () documents the results of those workshops and uses social network analysis to examine the growth of a community of practice. We also share many of the lessons we learned as our workshops evolved, as they may be instructive to other members of the scientific community as they organize workshops of their own.

AB Nowadays Molecular Cell Biology (MCB) must be taught as science is practiced. Even though there are several approaches based on scientific practices, a key aspect is to define the purpose of each of these teaching strategies and, most importantly, their implementation. Our goal was to train students to acquire, understand, and communicate new scientific knowledge in the field. The main feature of our new teaching methodology was progressive training in scientific practices associated with a back-and-forward interplay between activities and assessments. The methodology was implemented over 4 years, in students attending the MCB course of the undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences. In the first two modules, the students were prepared to comprehend MCB concepts and techniques and to experience activities based on scientific practices. In the third module, the students analyzed a primary paper in-depth. They were assessed by midterm exams based on a primary paper, written laboratory reports, and the oral presentation of a scientific paper. Our teaching proposal was evaluated through the students' academic performance and by their opinion on the teaching methodology. Most students were satisfied since they improved their acquisition of concepts, their interpretation and integration of scientific knowledge, and developed skills to communicate scientific knowledge in writing and orally. The novelty of transversal interconnections and progressive training in scientific practices provides students with skills in acquiring and understanding new scientific information, even beyond the MCB course.

AB The transition to remote-teaching online for Molecular Biology has forced active learning exercises like Escape Rooms to also move online. In the past, Escape Rooms have been an effective tool for students to help reinforce concepts they learned in Molecular Biology. We propose that there is a way for Escape Rooms to be moved to an online setting and still be an effective avenue for students to learn the material in a fun and interactive way.

AB Compared to aerobic catabolism, the theories and experiments of anaerobic catabolism are not covered in depth in biochemistry education curricula. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a feasible method for converting common organic compounds to renewable energy-methane that has drawn a great deal of attention in practical applications. In this study, we designed an AD laboratory experiment for use in undergraduate biochemistry courses to supplement the knowledge of metabolic networks in biochemistry and extend the information presented in biochemistry textbooks. In this laboratory experiment, students explored the methane production performance of wheat straw (WS; a representative and commonly available agricultural waste) and mastered a reasonable method for utilizing this new biochemical reaction to convert organic wastes from renewable resources to methane. Basic experimental procedures, such as a biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay, data analysis, and graphic presentations were organized to provide students with abundant hands-on experience. Furthermore, calculations of significant parameters, such as total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), experimental methane yield (EMY), maximum theoretical methane production (MMP), and biodegradability (B-D), were also performed. From this AD experiment, students learned not only a new series of biochemical reactions but also a novel strategy to achieve cleaner methane production from organic wastes, exhibiting a positive impact for students' learning in biochemistry course.

ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
AB Metagenomics is a tool that enables researchers to study genetic material recovered directly from microbial communities or microbiomes. Fueled by advances in sequencing technologies, bioinformatics tools, and sample processing, metagenomics studies promise to expand our understanding of human health and the use of microorganisms for agriculture and industry. Therefore, teaching students about metagenomics is crucial to prepare them for modern careers in the life sciences. However, the increasing number of different approaches makes teaching metagenomics to students a challenge. This 8-week metagenomics laboratory course has the objective of introducing upper-level undergraduate and graduate students to strategies for designing, executing, and analyzing microbiome investigations. The laboratory component begins with sample processing, library preparation, and submission for high-throughput sequencing before transitioning to computer-based activities, which include an introduction to several fundamental computational metagenomics tools. Students analyze their sequencing results and deposit findings in sequence databases. The laboratory component is complemented by a weekly lecture, where active learning sessions promote retrieval practice and allow students to reflect on and diagram processes performed in the laboratory. Attainment of student learning outcomes was assessed through the completion of various course assignments: laboratory reports, presentations, and a cumulative final exam. Further, students' perceptions of their gains relevant to the learning outcomes were evaluated using pre- and postcourse surveys. Collectively, these data demonstrate that this course results in the attainment of the learning outcomes and that this approach provides an adaptable way to expose students to the cutting-edge field of metagenomics.

TI A new twist on the graduate student journal club: Using a topic-centered

ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION; CLASSROOM; MODEL
AB Journal clubs are widely used as an educational tool in graduate life science programs. In journal clubs, students are assigned to read specific journal articles to achieve a broad knowledge in their field of study and to gain competence in reading and assessing scientific publications. However, students often show low motivation to read assigned articles, and under-prepared students contribute little to in-class discussions. In order to promote student engagement in graduate-level journal clubs, we used an inverted, student-centered format that focuses on a scientific question or topic rather than specific publications. Both the weekly topics and the scientific publications were selected by the students and focused on aspects of the students' thesis research. For each weekly topic, students were asked to find papers, read the papers and summarize the findings during class, which led to the presentation of a variety of approaches and viewpoints. This approach trained students in literature search, focused reading and oral presentation skills and provided a broad overview of the research in the selected topic areas. Student feedback showed a high level of acceptance of the new format. We propose this inverted journal club format as a useful alternative to traditional formats, because it focuses on a different scientific skill set and leads to increased student engagement through its student-centered approach.

DE Creativity; curriculum; biomedical sciences; higher education
AB Creativity is a uniquely human trait and it is the force behind many modern advancements. Due to the rapid changes seen across the economy and society, creativity has become highly valued and is in increasing demand by employers. To prepare students to meet this demand, many education stakeholders (such as Monash University) have incorporated creativity into their ethos. However, preliminary analysis of the learning objectives of the Bachelor of Biomedical Science degree (program) at Monash University identified little reference to creativity, even though one of its Graduate Attributes is to become a "creative scholar." The aims of this study were to ascertain the biomedical science students' perception of creativity in the program and to evaluate the program's core units (subjects) for creative learning opportunities. The data shows that students perceived a lack of creativity in the program. However, using Bloom's taxonomy's definition of create, an evaluation of the creative learning opportunities in the core Biomedical Science units identified the presence of a variety of creative opportunities. This discrepancy between student perceptions and learning opportunities lead to the question: Why do not students recognize creative learning opportunities? From the survey responses and mapping data, three reasons were identified: students' lack of awareness of a Graduate attribute, a lack of explicit reference to creativity at the program and unit level, and students' lack of understanding of creativity.

AB Bioinformatics was recently introduced as a module for both undergraduate and postgraduate biological sciences students at our institution. Our experience shows that inquiry-based hands-on exercises provide the most efficient approach to bioinformatic straining. In this article, we report a structural bioinformatics project carried out by Master degree students to determine structure-function relationships of the uncharacterized prokaryotic 5-oxoprolinase subunit A (PxpA). PxpA associates with the PxpBC complex to form a functional 5-oxoprolinase enzyme for conversion of 5-oxoproline to L-glutamate. Although the exact role of PxpA is yet to be determined, it has been demonstrated that PxpBC catalyses the first step of the reaction, which is phosphorylation of 5-oxoproline. Here, we provide evidence that PxpA is involved in the last two steps of the reaction:decyclization of the labile phosphorylated 5-oxoproline to the equally labile gamma-glutamylphosphate, and subsequent dephosphorylation to L-glutamate. Structural bioinformatics analysis of four putative PxpA structures revealed that PxpA adopts a non-canonical TIM barrel fold with well-characterized TIM barrel enzyme features. These include a C-terminal groove comprising potentially essential conserved amino acid residues organized into putative motifs. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a relationship between taxonomic grouping and PxpA oligomerization. PxpA forms a tunnel upon ligand binding, thus suggesting that the PxpABC complex employs the mechanism of substrate channeling to protect labile intermediates. Ultimately, students were able to form a testable hypothesis on the function of PxpA, an achievement we consider encouraging other students to emulate.

ID CYTOSOLIC GLUTAMINE-SYNTHETASE; MAIZE
AB Plant nitrogen nutrition is an essential topic in biology that should be included in scientific education. Nitrogen availability is one of the primary limiting factors for plant growth, and these organisms are the primary support for the pluricellular terrestrial life, since they are the fundamental group of autotrophs. For this reason, the use of nitrogen fertilizers is in the basis of the Green Revolution that led to an extraordinary increase in the food production during the twentieth century. To illustrate the importance of plant nitrogen nutrition, a new laboratory experience for students is presented in this manuscript. The aim of the following laboratory teaching activity is training of students through the evaluation of metabolic, biochemical, and molecular markers that are related to the nitrogen nutritional status of plants. For this purpose, cherry tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) were used, since they exhibit rapid growth and good differential biomass accumulation in response to changes in the nitrogen supply.

AB The advent of the high-throughput next-generation sequencing produced a large number of biological data. Knowledge discovery from the huge amount of available biological data requires researchers to develop solid skills in biology and computer science. As the majority of the Bioinformatics professionals are either computer science or life sciences graduates, to teach biology skills to computer science students and computational skills to life science students has become usual. In this article, we reported the experience of teaching programming for life science students. Our strategy is composed by explaining basic concepts of algorithms, abstraction of biological problems, and script programming using Python language. Based on the student's answers to an assessment questionnaire, we conclude that the course achieved positive results. They reported an improvement in their skills in programming and bioinformatics. Furthermore, the students approved the didactic adopted in the classes and evaluation methods (programming exercises and final presentation). This article is useful for other professors who want to implement an initial bioinformatics training for undergraduate or graduate students in life sciences. We believe that the strategies here demonstrated could be reproduced, which could help in the formation of a new generation of bioinformaticians with hybrid abilities in computation and biology.

AB The traditional teaching style in higher education is didactic. However, the current literature states that student learning improves when they are active players in the process, triggering the move to implement active learning within the curriculum. In accordance, Monash University (an Australian research-intensive university) introduced the "Better Teaching Better Learning" agenda to deliver a more student-centered learning experience but its implementation has been inconsistent across its different schools. Interviews and an online survey were conducted to evaluate the teaching practices in lectures of Biomedical Science academics, identify barriers preventing them from implementing active learning in their teaching, and identify possible strategies to overcome said barriers. The two main teaching groups use a variety of teaching styles in lectures, with education-focused academics employing more active learning practices. Many academics were in the process of changing their teaching style, mainly to improve the overall student learning experience. However, complex barriers prevent them from doing so. Possible strategies were identified that would help academics adopt a more student-centered teaching style. (c) 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(1):29-40, 2018.

AB Biochemistry and molecular techniques are used for the development of the scientific practice of students. To improve both the teaching and learning quality and promote the students' motivation, this article outlines an interactive "Virtual Simulation and Actual Operation Combined" approach by using a tailored virtual practice-learning platform and participated by students and lectures, as well as a curriculum secretary. The implementation of the Virtual Simulation Laboratory provides a series of learning resources, which the students can access in their own time; and the participation of the curriculum secretary also makes the class more interactive and efficient. This method incorporates an experimental platform and a virtual experiment class to utilize fully both the traditional and virtual teaching methods and thereby promote effective student learning.

AB Exposure of organisms to high temperatures and various chemical and physical stressors can cause protein misfolding and aggregation. In turn, this can disrupt the functions of proteins, threatening both development and homeostasis. To overcome this, cells can initiate the highly conserved heat shock (HS) stress response pathway. In eukaryotes, this is a coordinated cellular response, in which the master HS activator, heat shock factor (HSF), is rapidly recruited to the HS protein genes, and triggers the recruitment of additional coactivator proteins that facilitate gene expression. This results in the production of HS proteins that function as nuclear and cytosolic molecular chaperones, to promote refolding of proteins and prevent aggregation and increase protein degradation pathways. Here, we describe a laboratory exercise in which students visualize and quantify Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged HSF binding to the HS protein genes in living Drosophila salivary gland nuclei as an output of chemically induced protein misfolding. Students are assigned an array of chemicals, and using the scientific literature, predict impacts of these chemicals on protein folding. Students then test the effects of their chemicals by measuring GFP-tagged HSF binding to the HS genes in salivary glands using confocal microscopy. Designed for junior and senior level students in a cell/molecular biology course, this is a two-part lab, in which student work closely with an instructor to help familiarize them with developing hypotheses supported by scientific literature and testing these hypotheses by quantitating the levels of GFP-HSF binding, using confocal microscopy of living Drosophila cells.

ID HIGH-QUALITY
AB The practice of RNA isolation in undergraduate experimental courses is rare because of the existence of robust, ubiquitous and stable ribonucleases. We reported here modifications to our original protocol for RNA isolation from plant tissues, including the recovery of nucleic acids by ethanol precipitation at 0 degrees C for 10 min and the assessment of RNA quality by visualizing the banding profile of the separated RNAs on a standard nondenaturing agarose gel to shorten the duration of the whole procedure and simplify the operation. As a result, the modified procedure, including RNA isolation and quality control analysis could be finished in 4 hr and divided into two sessions. Because endogenous ribonucleases released upon disruption of the organelles and vacuoles were effectively and quickly inactivated, measures were taken to protect RNA integrity throughout the whole procedure so that total RNA with high purity and integrity as well as an appropriate yield could be obtained by students. The RNA isolation protocol described here was simple, efficient, flexible, and low cost. Therefore, it is an ideal approach for undergraduates to learn about RNA techniques. The pedagogical approach of the correlation of experimental work with the rationale for the whole protocol described in this report is an effective way for undergraduates to improve their learning of the techniques of RNA isolation and analysis and the theories behind them, as well as experimental design and data analysis.

AB At the Portuguese universities, practical classes of life sciences are usually professor-centered 2-hour classes. This approach results in students underprepared for a real work environment in a research/clinical laboratory. To provide students with a real-life laboratory environment, the Non-Stop Lab Week (NSLW) was created in the Molecular Biomedicine master program at the University of Aveiro, Portugal. The unique feature of the NSLW is its intensity: during a 1-week period, students perform a subcloning and a protein expression project in an environment that mimics a real laboratory. Students work autonomously, and the progression of work depends on achieving the daily goals. Throughout the three curricular years, most students considered the intensity of the NSLW a very good experience and fundamental for their future. Moreover, after some experience in a real laboratory, students state that both the techniques and the environment created in the NSLW were similar to what they experience in their current work situation. The NSLW fulfills a gap in postgraduate students' learning, particularly in practical skills and scientific thinking. Furthermore, the NSLW experience provides skills to the students that are crucial to their future research area.

AB As non-scientific conceptions interfere with learning processes, teachers need both, to know about them and to address them in their classrooms. For our study, based on 182 eleventh graders, we analyzed the level of conceptual understanding by implementing the "draw and write" technique during a computer-supported gene technology module. To give participants the hierarchical organizational level which they have to draw, was a specific feature of our study. We introduced two objective category systems for analyzing drawings and inscriptions. Our results indicated a long-as well as a short-term increase in the level of conceptual understanding and in the number of drawn elements and their grades concerning the DNA structure. Consequently, we regard the "draw and write" technique as a tool for a teacher to get to know students' alternative conceptions. Furthermore, our study points the modification potential of hands-on and computer-supported learning modules.

ID METHYLATION
AB Topics on the molecular basis underlying cancer are quite popular among students. Also, excellent textbooks abound that provide interesting materials for discussion during lectures and tutorials about major events leading to cancer formation and progression. However, much less is available for students to conduct experiments for the analysis of cancer samples in undergraduate modules where there is a limited time-frame. Given the difficulty of working with cancer samples and the scarcity of good samples even in the clinical laboratories, it is impossible to run large-class practicals using patients' samples. Here, we describe the use of tissue slides in combination with polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) as a means of simulating an investigative approach to supplement students' learning of clinical research. By using tissue slides for histo-pathogical examinations and specific budding yeast genomic DNA and primers adapted to demonstrate methylation-specific PCR, we designed an inquiry-based lab session to simulate the clinical investigation of a cohort of biopsies that students could analyze in a one-session practical.

AB Scientific writing is a demanding task and many students need more time than expected to finish their research articles. To speed up the process, we highlight some tools, strategies as well as writing guides. We recommend starting early in the research process with writing and to prepare research articles, not after but in parallel to the lab or field work. We suggest considering scientific writing as a team enterprise, which needs proper organization and regular feedback. In addition, it is helpful to select potential target journals early and to consider not only scope and reputation, but also decision times and rejection rates. Before submission, instructions to authors and writing guides should be considered, and drafts should be extensively revised. Later in the process editor's and reviewer's comments should be followed. Our tips and tools help students and advisors to structure the writing and publishing process, thereby stimulating them to develop their own strategies to success.

AB To enhance the preparedness of graduates from the Biochemistry and Biotechnology (BCBT) Major at Minnesota State University Moorhead for employment in the bioscience industry we have developed a new Industry certificate program. The BCBT Industry Certificate was developed to address specific skill sets that local, regional, and national industry experts identified as lacking in new B.S. and B.A. biochemistry graduates. The industry certificate addresses concerns related to working in a regulated industry such as Good Laboratory Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices, and working in a Quality System. In this article we specifically describe how we developed a validation course that uses Standard Operating Procedures to describe grading policy and laboratory notebook requirements in an effort to better prepare students to transition into industry careers.

AB An undergraduate biochemistry laboratory experiment is described that will teach students the practical and theoretical considerations for measuring the equilibrium dissociation constant (K-D) for a protein/DNA interaction using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). An EMSA monitors the migration of DNA through a native gel; the DNA migrates more slowly when bound to a protein. To determine a K-D the amount of unbound and protein-bound DNA in the gel is measured as the protein concentration increases. By performing this experiment, students will be introduced to making affinity measurements and gain experience in performing quantitative EMSAs. The experiment describes measuring the K-D for the interaction between the chimeric protein GAL4-p53 and its DNA recognition site; however, the techniques are adaptable to other DNA binding proteins. In addition, the basic experiment described can be easily expanded to include additional inquiry-driven experimentation. (c) 2012 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB The Michaelis-Menten rate equation can be found in most general biochemistry textbooks, where the time derivative of the substrate is a hyperbolic function of two kinetic parameters (the limiting rate V, and the Michaelis constant KM) and the amount of substrate. However, fundamental concepts of enzyme kinetics can be difficult to understand fully, or can even be misunderstood, by students when based only on the differential form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the variety of methods available to calculate the kinetic constants from rate versus substrate concentration "textbook data.'' Consequently, enzyme kinetics can be confusing if an analytical solution of the Michaelis-Menten equation is not available. Therefore, the still rarely known exact solution to the Michaelis-Menten equation is presented here through the explicit closed-form equation in terms of the Lambert W(x) function. Unfortunately, as the W(x) is not available in standard curve-fitting computer programs, the practical use of this direct solution is limited for most life-science students. Thus, the purpose of this article is to provide analytical approximations to the equation for modeling Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The elementary and explicit nature of these approximations can provide students with direct and simple estimations of kinetic parameters from raw experimental time-course data. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics studied in the latter context can provide an ideal alternative to the 100-year-old problems of data transformation, graphical visualization, and data analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Hence, the content of the course presented here could gradually become an important component of the modern biochemistry curriculum in the 21st century.

AB We have developed a 9-week undergraduate laboratory series focused on the purification and characterization of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq). Our aim was to provide undergraduate biochemistry students with a full-semester continuing project simulating a research-like experience, while having each week's procedure focus on a single learning goal. The laboratory series has been taught for the past 7 years, and survey-based assessment of the effectiveness of the laboratory series was completed during the 2006 and 2007 fall semesters. Statistical analysis of the survey results demonstrate that the laboratory series is very effective in teaching students the theory and practice of protein purification and analysis while also demonstrating positive results in more broad areas of scientific skill and knowledge. Amongst the findings, the largest reported increases in knowledge were related to students' understanding of how patent law relates to laboratory science, a topic of great importance to modern researchers that is readily discussed in relation to Taq polymerase. Overall, this laboratory series proves to be a very effective component in the curricula of undergraduate biology and chemistry majors and may be an appropriate laboratory experience for undergraduates.

AB Emerging interest in genomics in the scientific community prompted biologists at James Madison University to create two courses at different levels to modernize the biology curriculum. The courses are hybrids of classroom and laboratory experiences. An upper level class uses raw sequence of a genome (plasmid or virus) as the subject on which to base the experience of genomic analysis. Students also learn bioinformatics and software programs needed to support a project linking structure and function in proteins and showing evolutionary relatedness of similar genes. An optional entry-level course taken in addition to the required first-year curriculum and sponsored in part by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, engages first year students in a primary research project. In the first semester, they isolate and characterize novel bacteriophages that infect soil bacteria. In the second semester, these young scientists annotate the genes on one or more of the unique viruses they discovered. These courses are demanding but exciting for both faculty and students and should be accessible to any interested faculty member.

AB Students often see college courses as the presentation of disconnected facts, especially in the life sciences. Student-created Structure Mechanism/Relationship Function (SMRF) models were analyzed to understand students' abilities to make connections between genotype, phenotype, and evolution. Students were divided into two sections; one section received instructions that included a specific gene as an example related to larger issues like human disease or the environment. The other section was only given generic examples, like gene X and phenotype Y. Coding of exam models and a comprehensive (extensive) model reveled students were able to make links and work within and between biological scales of organization. Modeling provided a way to show and allow students to practice and demonstrate the ability to build step-by-step causal relationships that link ideas together. We also observed a small differing with students receiving the specific prompt performing better than students receiving generic prompt at the point in the semester where linking across many biological scales was required to be successful.

ID GROUP-SIZE
AB To evaluate the impact of active learning approaches in a basic molecular and cell biology course for undergraduate students, we assessed the effect of learning by teaching and peer review on the learning outcomes. A literature seminar activity with peer review and feedback was organized as a compulsory activity for all students, covering about 25% of the course content. The remaining 75% of the course was delivered as classical lectures. The students collaborated in groups to present the content of a review article complemented with a research article. For each group of students, an opponent group was assigned to challenge the presenting group by questions and contribute to the evaluation of the presentation together with the teacher. Based on the feedback survey, the students reacted positively to this active learning exercise, and they strongly recommended keeping it in the future editions of the course. The students' exam scores strongly indicated that the learning outcomes from the learning by teaching part of the course were consistently higher than from the classical lecture part of the course. Further optimization of the active learning part of the course is outlined based on student feedback.

AB We developed a curriculum for an upper-level molecular biology course-based undergraduate research laboratory class funded by a National Science Foundation CAREER grant that focuses on identifying new small proteins in the bacterium, Escherichia coli. Our CURE class has been continually offered each semester for the last 10 years, with multiple instructors collaboratively developing and implementing their own pedagogical approach while maintaining the same overall scientific goal and experimental strategy. In this paper, we delineate the experimental strategy for our molecular biology CURE laboratory class, describe a range of pedagogical approaches implemented by multiple instructors, and provide recommendations for teaching the class. The purpose of our paper is to share our experiences both in developing and teaching a molecular biology CURE laboratory class based on small protein identification and in creating a curriculum and support system that allows traditional, non-traditional, and under-represented students to participate in authentic research projects.

AB During the pandemic, a 4th year course: Biology of Aging was modified with extensive flipped classroom strategies to promote better student engagement. By utilizing the strength of the Zoom video conferencing platform students were able to have meaningful in-class experiences that promoted engagement and learning. This was further enhanced by shifting traditional lectures to a pre-recorded format to act as resources and promoting forum discussions outside of class times using the course management system (Brightspace). These changes influenced the satisfaction and benefited the student experience. Shifting to active student-centered learning and facilitation led to a dynamic well received teaching environment. The one trade off being that students needed to produce content every week, which was perceived as a heavy but manageable workload by many in the course. These changes can be used as a format for other online courses.

ID ASSAY
AB As a universal and extensively adopted technique, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used to detect and quantify small molecules in many applications both clinical and analytical. However, generally, students experiment mechanically using commercial ELISA kits according to the instructions and eventually produce a standard curve to calculate the concentration of the sample to be measured, cannot understand the critical factors and process of method establishment. This study systematically introduced undergraduates to using the pathogen-specific antigen and establishing an indirect ELISA method to detect the diagnostic target pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei. This course aimed to develop the experimental skills of the students and improve their scientific research knowledge, which fully embody the organic combination of scientific research and teaching. Students independently selected the diagnostic antigen target of interest, obtained the antigen proteins using genetic engineering techniques, and established an ELISA method through a series of conditional optimization experiments. In addition, typical student-generated data, experimental methods, and a student feedback interpretation are presented in this study. Overall, the students were able to combine abstract knowledge with practice and understand the principles and applications of antigen-antibody interactions, thus enabling them to gain practical experience in molecular biology techniques, and learn how to use this principle to establish an ELISA method for detecting infectious diseases.

AB Basic knowledge of biochemistry underpins oral and dental care. Undergraduate dental students do not always engage well with basic science teaching due to not appreciating its clinical relevance. Co-teaching provides one approach to overcome students' disengagement and involves two lecturers, with complementary expertise, presenting the curriculum together. This study investigated student experiences and engagement using co-teaching to integrate biochemistry with clinical sciences in the students' second-year dental curriculum. Two successive second year dental student cohorts were co-taught. Content was delivered by a biochemist and an oral biologist, either online (during the 2020 COVID lockdown) or in-person (2021). Each cohort was surveyed at the end of the teaching module using an online questionnaire containing both interval scale and free-text questions. Responses were received from 39 (42%) and 64 (85%) of students in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Students from both cohorts preferred the co-teaching approach with a mean of 8.74 on a 10-point interval scale. In 2020 and 2021, 77% and 76% of participants, respectively, preferred a combined biochemistry and clinical dentistry delivery, either in-person (37%), via Zoom (19%) or via video recording (14%). Thematic analysis of responses revealed students experienced enhanced engagement when co-taught and they attributed this to integration of the curriculum making the content more relevant and stimulating. Students preferred co-teaching to individual subjects being taught by a single teacher. Co-teaching established the relevance of theoretical biochemistry to clinical dental sciences and enhanced the students' learning experience.

ID OUTCOMES
AB The COVID-19 pandemic created an unpredictable and stressful situation for both students and instructors. With current instruction largely occurring in an online environment, we propose that increased flexibility in course structure will best support student learning. Flexible course structure offers a trauma-aware approach to teaching, is in line with the Universal Design for Learning, and increases student motivation and meaningful learning. It can also provide more authentic experiences akin to science-based careers. We provide several specific suggestions for incorporating flexibility in one's class, as well as outline considerations and caveats. Our hope is that flexibility necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to inspire change in future course design and educational paradigms.

DE biochemistry; competency-based training; E-learning; inverted classroom
AB On-site teaching at Ulm University was restricted in the summer semester (SS) 2020 due to the Corona pandemic. The biochemistry seminar "From gene to protein" in the 2nd preclinical semester, which had been successfully conducted as an Inverted Classroom (IC), had to be changed to an online concept. The aim of this study was to analyze the concept conversion in terms of students' satisfaction and knowledge acquisition. In the seminar, human medical students of the 2nd semester acquired biochemical and competency-oriented learning content. In SS2019, the course was taught using the IC concept. For the conversion to the online format in the SS2020, alternative teaching materials were developed and used. Students' satisfaction was assessed by an evaluation questionnaire and knowledge acquisition was tested by a written biochemistry exam. For both teaching concepts a high level of satisfaction was detected. Individual evaluation criteria were evaluated similarly by the students for both concepts. The online concept led up to significantly higher biochemistry exam scores. Due to the high levels of students' satisfaction in both concepts and the results of the biochemistry exam, it can be concluded that online teaching offers a suitable substitute. Based on these results, it is worth to undertake further research on digitization of studies.

AB Virtual laboratories have started to be the leading alternative teaching tools during the Covid-19 pandemic process. The "Acid-Base" subject is among those that form the foundations of biochemistry. Students can learn the "Acid-Base" subject in a secure environment, with remote access through the use of virtual laboratory simulations. Simulation was applied to fourth-year undergraduate students in Turkey who want to obtain a bachelor's degree in science teaching during the present study. During the application process, the students conducted different experiments on the concepts of strong acid, strong base and pH, which are the basic concepts of biochemistry. In addition, student opinions regarding the application were also obtained. It was thus determined that the majority of the students were able to write hypotheses, test their accuracy and report the test findings correctly; a small number of students started to apply the simulations after examining them in accordance with scientific terminology. At the end of the application, the students also stated that they had fun during the application which also provided effective learning. It is recommended that classroom activity which is integrated with simulation be used in Chemistry, Biochemistry and Science Laboratory Applications courses.

AB Many large, undergraduate science courses, which still heavily rely on traditional lecture-based dissemination of content, passive learning, and exam-based assessments, have been forced online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To address the challenges facing students in regards to engagement, self-directed learning, and the development of soft skills, we modified a large, lecture-based third-year undergraduate biochemistry course at the University of Toronto to foster active learning through interactive e-modules. We also adjusted the evaluation model to focus on the development of reflection, critical thinking, science literacy, and communication.

ID PHYSIOLOGY; STUDENTS
AB The practical work described here is designed for third-year bachelor students in Life Sciences attending a kidney physiology course. It illustrates how urinary biochemistry can be used for a medical diagnosis. Students have to measure glucose, proteins, and creatinine concentrations in three simulated urine samples. First, they independently elaborate detailed protocols from the biochemical kit's technical sheets. Second, after correction of the protocols by the teacher, they perform the biochemical assays. Finally, students write a report in which they interpret the biochemical data and use them in the context of histological images assigned to each urine sample. With their results, their theoretical background and scientific articles supplied by the teacher, they establish the diagnosis indicating which patients are diseased and from which disease they are suffering (diabetes without nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephropathy). The originality of this practical work is to give student autonomy from the start of the project by requiring them to write the protocols, and determine the diagnosis by themselves. Simple and inexpensive, this practical forces students to mobilize their knowledge in renal physiology and pathophysiology as well as those acquired in other disciplines such as biochemistry or cellular biology. A survey conducted on two classes of students confirmed that this type of training helps students to better understand renal physiology, to realize the importance of interdisciplinarity (biochemistry, histology, and physiology) and to develop confidence in their ability to work independently.

ID INTEGRATION
AB Many students in the sciences are interested in exploring research opportunities; however, the one-on-one faculty mentorship model often lacks the ability to supervise large numbers of students. An alternative mechanism for exposing undergraduate students to the research process is participation in a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). CUREs promote inclusivity in research, and provide structure for both students and faculty while engaging students in scientific discovery. This study describes a model for a CURE in cancer biology, and reports student outcomes. Students utilized bioinformatics to predict targets genes of miR-100, a microRNA that is differentially expressed in a cell culture model of breast cancer metastasis. Students were required to engage with primary literature to write a grant proposal for their target gene, and then were trained to perform basic molecular biology techniques to test their individual hypotheses. Additionally, the course integrated opportunities to troubleshoot experiments and present data to the group, and culminated in a publication style scientific report discussing the results of their individual research project. Students reported significantly increased confidence in executing various molecular biology techniques and research-related skills based on pre- and post-assessment surveys. Student feedback also indicated that they gained an understanding of primary literature, experimental design, and scientific writing as a result of the course. This study supports that CUREs can be an effective pedagogy for not only engaging larger groups of students in research, but also improving their confidence and skill set in the laboratory.

AB Concept-maps are widely used to assess students' conceptual understanding in different subject areas. Conventionally, it is mostly built maps which are assessed. In this study, we explore if "concept-mapping" could be used as a case for constructive alignment of both the process and the outcome of learning. Specifically, we have studied how a simple measure of looking at the order in which concept map elements-concepts (cards, C), links (arrows, A), and linking phrases (phrases, P)- are placed on the working space reveals information about the quality of the final generated map. We report findings from analysis of the concept-mapping process in two separate groups of university students (N= 38 (18 + 20)) who were asked, individually, to build concept maps related to two separate concepts in biology and chemistry respectively. We found that, across both groups, students consistently followed the same order of element placement that they began with and found significant differences in the quality of eventual maps resulting from students' map building strategies. Our results suggest that the quality of students' concept maps depends considerably on the strategy used to build it, and point to the supplementary role that the physical working space of the concept-mapping exercise offers to students' own working memory as a possible explanation for these quality differences.

AB The recent lockdown of laboratories in the COVID-19 era has negatively impacted many lab-based courses for undergraduate students; however, research project classes have been hardest hit. Unlike the lab-based lecture courses, where many of the lab instructors have resorted to virtual experiments and videos to substitute for actual lab experiments, senior year independent research courses, which are supposed to involve real lab-based research, are struggling to find an appropriate solution. A possible solution to cases where the coronavirus pandemic lockdown has led to no or little student-generated lab data are to shift the focus of these research project courses such that they are taught as mentor-guided critical thinking exercises, using the primary literature. As an example, the lack of complete understanding for the molecular basis of protein thermostability can be used to promote such higher-level thinking skills.

AB The bibliometric analysis of the Brazilian periodical Journal of Biochemistry Education (JBE) covered the 117 articles published in 15 volumes in the period 2001-2017. Our results showed a positive trend in JBE publications with a significant increase in the number of articles since 2014, which can be related to the increase in research groups working in this area. The Southeast region of Brazil was the most productive one mainly due to the contribution of papers from institutions located in the State of Sao Paulo. Only four articles aimed the undergraduate courses (87.0%) showing methodological approaches to teach biochemistry (51.3%) and laboratory exercises (18.8%) among others. Most of the 332 authors contributed to a single article (87.7%) and just 3% of them published more than twice in JBE. The majority of the JBE articles had at least one citation in Google Scholar. There is also a great variety in the references used by the authors. Our analysis showed that JBE is an important peer reviewed publication aimed to improve teaching and learning of Biochemistry in Brazil.

AB We investigate the effectiveness of an active learning curriculum designed for an upper division Biochemistry series at a large, public research university. The goal was to determine how effective this format was when compared to a parallel conventional course, and to see if the active learning series can be run with limited resources (one instructor, one teaching assistant). The study involved 160 students in the first quarter and 92 students in the second quarter. The active learning curriculum consists of learning goals for each chapter, online quizzes, in-class questions targeting the problematic areas, small group (3-4 students) discussions during class in which students presented their assumptions and arguments in support of their responses to online and in-class questions, and two-stage exams involving the ability to "re-answer" as a group following a discussion). The in-class questions involved the use of a student response system (i > clicker) (multiple choice) and short answer formats. Students in the active learning course and a control, conventional lecture course, took identical midterms and finals for the first, and second quarters. We found that students enrolled in the active learning curriculum had consistently better performance, with statistically significant higher scores on all tests for both quarters. The effect sizes of the improvements are medium to large and are independent of prior GPA and grades in prerequisites. This model curriculum redesign offers promise for improved student learning with less monetary investment than a flipped course model relying on, for example, an extensive collection of instructor-produced videos.

AB Focused self-directed learning is very much essential at present in medical education to catch-up with the increasing information load. Cognitive psychology laboratory studies show that repeated testing of information produces superior retention relative to repeated study. The overall goal of this intervention was to evaluate the effectiveness of Test enhanced learning in the form of Open book examination as a formative assessment in Biochemistry when compared to Self-study. Three exercises were carried out after the regular teaching sessions on different topics in biochemistry for the first year MBBS students. A multiple choice questions based pretest was conducted after the regular lecture classes on a topic but before the revision exercise. The students were subjected Open book examination with short answer questions for a period of 1 hour. A posttest was done with the same set of MCQs after the revision exercises. The gain score of Open book examination was compared with that of Self study. Feedback from the students was taken. The isolated results from each of the three exercises conducted and their combined results supported the hypothesis that Test enhanced learning in the form of open book examination is a superior form of learning process than self-study for assimilation of knowledge. Most of the students opined that the Open book examination enhanced their self directed focused learning process. The students felt that Open book examination is more beneficial than Self study in reinforcing the learning concepts after regular didactic lectures.

AB A software to calculate the net charge and to predict the isoelectric point (pI) of a polypeptide is developed in this work using the graphical programming language LabVIEW. Through this instrument the net charges of the ionizable residues of the polypeptide chains of the proteins are calculated at different pH values, tabulated, pI is predicted and an Excel (-xls) type file is generated. In this work, the experimental values of the pIs (pI) of different proteins are compared with the values of the pIs (pI) calculated graphically, achieving a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.934746 which represents a good reliability for a p < 0.01. In this way the generated program can constitute an instrument applicable in the laboratory, facilitating the calculation to graduate students and junior researchers.

AB Students' understandings of foundational concepts such as noncovalent interactions, pH and pK(a) are crucial for success in undergraduate biochemistry courses. We developed a guided-inquiry activity to aid students in making connections between noncovalent interactions and pH/pK(a). Students explore these concepts by examining the primary and tertiary structures of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Protein A. Students use PyMOL, an open source molecular visualization application, to (1) identify hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between and within the proteins at physiological pH and (2) apply their knowledge of pH/pK(a) to association rate constant data for these proteins at pH 4 and pH 11. The laboratory activity was implemented within a one semester biochemistry laboratory for students majoring in allied health disciplines, engineering, and biological sciences. Several extensions for more advanced students are discussed. Students' overall performance highlighted their ability to successfully complete tasks such as labeling and identifying noncovalent interactions and revealed difficulties with analyzing noncovalent interactions under varying pH/pK(a) conditions. Students' evaluations after completing the activity indicated they felt challenged but also recognized the potential of the activity to help them gain meaningful understanding of the connections between noncovalent interactions, pH, pK(a), and protein structure.

AB In this experiment, students in a large undergraduate biology course were first exposed to the concepts without new technical vocabulary ("jargon") in a pre-class reading assignment. Their learning of the concepts and jargon was compared with that of an equivalent group of students in another section of the same course, whose pre-class reading presented both the jargon and concepts together in the traditional manner. Both groups had the same active-learning classes with the same instructor, and then completed the same post-test. Although the two groups performed the same on the multiple choice questions of the post-test, the group exposed to concepts first and jargon second included 1.5 times and 2.5 times more correct arguments on two free-response questions about the concepts. The correct use of jargon between the two groups was similar, with the exception of one jargon term that the control group used more often. These results suggest that modest instructional changes whereby new concepts are introduced in a concepts-first, jargon-second manner can increase student learning, as demonstrated by their ability to articulate their understanding of new concepts.

AB In traditional introductory biochemistry laboratory classes students learn techniques for protein purification and analysis by following provided, established, step-by-step procedures. Students are exposed to a variety of biochemical techniques but are often not developing procedures or collecting new, original data. In this laboratory module, students develop research skills through work on an original research project and gain confidence in their ability to design and execute an experiment while faculty can enhance their scholarly pursuits through the acquisition of original data in the classroom laboratory. Students are prepared for a 6-8 week discovery-driven project on the purification of the Escherichia coli cytidylate kinase (CMP kinase) through in class problems and other laboratory exercises on bioinformatics and protein structure analysis. After a minimal amount of guidance on how to perform the CMP kinase in vitro enzyme assay, SDS-PAGE, and the basics of protein purification, students, working in groups of three to four, develop a protein purification protocol based on the scientific literature and investigate some aspect of CMP kinase that interests them. Through this process, students learn how to implement a new but perhaps previously worked out procedure to answer their research question. In addition, they learn the importance of keeping a clear and thorough laboratory notebook and how to interpret their data and use that data to inform the next set of experiments.

AB Bioprocess engineering is a highly interdisciplinary field of study which is strongly benefited by practical courses where students can actively experience the interconnection between biology, engineering, and physical sciences. This work describes a lab course developed for 2nd year undergraduate students of bioprocess engineering and related disciplines, where students are challenged with a real-life bioprocess-engineering application, the production of recombinant protein in a fed-batch process. The lab course was designed to introduce students to the subject of operating and supervising an experiment in a bioreactor, along with the analysis of collected data and a final critical evaluation of the experiment. To provide visual feedback of the experimental outcome, the organism used during class was Escherichia coli which carried a plasmid to recombinantly produce enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) upon induction. This can easily be visualized in both the bioreactor and samples by using ultraviolet light. The lab course is performed with bioreactors of the simplest design, and is therefore highly flexible, robust and easy to reproduce. As part of this work the implementation and framework, the results, the evaluation and assessment of student learning combined with opinion surveys are presented, which provides a basis for instructors intending to implement a similar lab course at their respective institution.

AB Novel possibilities for employing genetic testing as part of the diagnostic process for a wide variety of diseases and conditions are emerging almost every day. This development brings prospects of more efficient treatment and prevention of serious and often lethal conditions. However, it also raises ethical questions concerning the issue of knowing or not knowing about our genetic make-up. Thus, as techniques for genetic testing are increasingly employed, demands on health professionals are changing. Health professionals must be able to inform and guide patients, and therefore they need knowledge and competencies related to both the technical and the ethical dimensions of genetic testing. This paper explores the requirements of the general education of health professionals if this need for ethics is acknowledged. It is suggested that it is important to include both an individualised and a societal ethical perspective to the development of genomic healthcare and that a key concept in doing so is professional reflectivity'. Employing one concrete example of teaching, this concept of reflectivity is operationalised in the health educational setting at the bachelor's level with a special focus on biomedical laboratory science, and three key concepts are developed: Gap sensitive interaction, professional humility, and contextual awareness. Additionally, anchored ethical dialog is explored as an instructional design that may support the development of reflectivity among health professionals.

AB The use of internet-based technologies in the teaching of laboratories has emerged as a promising education tool. This study evaluated the effectiveness of using remote access technology to operate an atomic absorption spectrophotometer in analyzing the iron content in a crude myoglobin extract. Sixty-two students were surveyed on their level of engagement, learning, and overall experience. Feedback from students suggests that the use of remote access technology is effective in teaching students the principles of chemical analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy.

   PROGRESSION
AB Recent studies indicated that the aberrant gene expression of peroxiredoxin-6 (prdx6) was found in various kinds of cancers. Because of its biochemical function and gene expression pattern in cancer cells, the association between genetic polymorphism of Prdx6 and cancer onset is interesting. In this report, we have developed and implemented a serial experiment in molecular biology laboratory course to teach single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to undergraduate students majoring in molecular biology or genetics. The flanking sequence of rs4382766 was located in Prdx6 gene, which contained a restriction site of SspI, and was used as a target in this lab course. The students could mimic real research by integrating different techniques, such as database retrieving, genomic DNA isolation, PCR, and restriction enzyme assay. This serial experiment of PCR-RFLP helps students set up intact idea of molecular biology and understand the relation among individual experiments. Students were found to be more enthusiastic during the laboratory classes than those in the former curriculum. (c) 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB Science undergraduate courses typically cater to a mixed-learner cohort, with a diversity of motivations and skills. This diversity introduces pressure for designers of the practical laboratory curriculum. Students who are struggling with the course need a series of tasks that begin simply, and transition to more conceptually difficult material. More capable students need opportunities for conceptual extension and creative activity. In this report, we examine an approach we have used to address this problem in the context of a large introductory biochemistry undergraduate class. Rather than attempting to compromise on a single practical series for our 470 students, we devised two parallel but equivalent practical streams and offered students their choice of laboratory experience. One stream (called Laboratory Experience for Acquiring Practical Skills) was designed to allow acquisition of a range of common biochemistry and molecular biology laboratory skills. The other (called Active Learning Laboratory Undergraduate Research Experience) was designed to offer an authentic (but scaffolded) undergraduate research project. We discuss the ramifications and implications of our approach in terms of funding, staffing, and assessment while also examining student motivation, satisfaction, and skills acquisition. We present data supporting the practical and pedagogical value of laboratory exercise streaming to meet the diverse needs of students. We suggest a framework that can be used to pre-emptively identify and address problems associated with a bifurcated practical series and increase the sustainability of the approach.

AB This study examined preservice teachers' understanding of biotechnology and its related processes. A sample comprised 88 elementary education preservice teachers at a large university in the Midwest of the USA. A total of 60 and 28 of the participants were enrolled in introductory and advanced science methods courses, respectively. Most participants had taken two integrated science courses at the college level. Data were collected using a questionnaire, which had open-ended items and which required participants to write the definitions and examples of the following terms: biotechnology, genetic engineering, cloning and genetically modified foods. The results indicate that preservice teachers had limited understanding of biotechnology and its related processes. The majority of the preservice teachers provided poor definitions, explanations, and examples of biotechnology, genetic engineering and genetically modified foods. Surprisingly, however, a moderate number of preservice teachers correctly defined cloning and provided correct examples of cloning. Implications for science teacher education, science curriculum, as well as recommendations for further research are discussed.

ID CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE
AB Structure function relationship studies in proteins are essential in modern Cell Biology. Laboratory exercises that allow students to familiarize themselves with basic mutagenesis techniques are essential in all Genetic Engineering courses to teach the relevance of protein structure. We have implemented a laboratory course based on the site-directed mutagenesis of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. The GFP is ideal because the students are able to correlate the changes introduced into the structure of the protein with the observable modification of its fluorescence properties. By using noncommercial kits, we set up a non PCR-thermocycling reaction using mutagenic primers, followed by removal of the original plasmid template by Dpnl digestion. By introducing only one (Y66H) or two mutations (Y66H/Y145F) in the "cycle 3" variant of GFP (F99S, M153T, and V163A) or GFPuv, students are able to analyze the changes from green to blue in the fluorescence emission of the mutated proteins and to correlate these differences in fluorescence with the structural changes using three-dimensional structure visualization software. This inexpensive laboratory course familiarizes the students with the design of mutagenic oligonucleotides, site-directed mutagenesis, bacterial transformation, restriction analysis of the mutated plasmids, and protein characterization by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence spectroscopy.

AB Science students leaving undergraduate programs are entering the biotechnology industry where they are presented with issues which require integration of science content. Students find this difficult as through-out their studies, most content is limited to a single subdiscipline (e.g., biochemistry, immunology). In addition, students need knowledge of the ethical, economic, and legal frame work in which the industry operates. This article presents an approach to deliver these outcomes in a collaborative and active learning modality which promotes deep learning. In the model, groups of final year undergraduate students form hypothetical biotechnology companies and identify real issues of interest to industry, make integrative team decisions, use professional level technology, and develop appropriate communication skills. The final successful teaching paradigm was based on self reflection, observation, and student feedback to ensure appropriate attainment of content, group work skills and increased confidence in professional decision-making. It is these outcomes which will facilitate life long learning skills, a major outcome applicable for all tertiary education.

AB This article summarizes the major components of curriculum design: vision, operationalization of the vision, design, and evaluation. It stresses that the relationship between these components is dynamic, and that the process of curriculum design does not proceed via a linear application of these components. The article then summarizes some of the major influences on curriculum design: policy, local context, societal expectations, research trends, and technology. Then, it provides examples of how these influences affect the design of a curriculum and ends with a comprehensive set of questions that instructors could use to guide their curriculum development process.

AB The purpose of the presented article is to evaluate the students' perception of the online teaching educational model as a part of the "Biochemistry with Elements of Chemistry " course conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic at the Faculty of Medicine of the Jagiellonian University Medical College. The first part of the article reflects upon the pandemic impact on the transition from the in-person (standard format) to a complete remote learning format. The next part is based on the responses of the students to a questionnaire and presents an analysis of the students' preferences and perceptions regarding synchronous and asynchronous teaching methods. Students answered questions about the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning programs. They indicated the most suitable learning mode in terms of gaining knowledge and enhancing their motivation to learn. They listed factors that facilitated remote learning as well as those which made it difficult and posed a challenge to adjust to the new system, in all types of classes, that is, lectures, seminars, and laboratories. The last part of this paper presents the results of the students' performance in the pandemic-enforced system and compares them with the results from the previous class of students from the past year, when teaching was conducted mainly in the standard format. The conclusions from the given analysis may enable beneficial changes for the "Biochemistry with Elements of Chemistry " course for remote teaching in the future. It may also provide valuable insights for such types of courses conducted at other Universities and promote deliberations to continuously improve learning outcomes.

AB Biochemistry primarily focuses on the non-metal chemical elements carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus in the four groups of building blocks (sugars, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides) and the corresponding macromolecules. However, at least 10 essential chemical elements of life are metals. This article discusses the consequences of such a bias, presents current knowledge that over 20 chemical elements are required for life, and makes a case for-and suggests benefits of-teaching elemental biology alongside molecular biology and biochemistry, and inorganic chemistry in addition to organic chemistry. A relatively new interdisciplinary field, metallomics, has the potential to be a platform for integration when added to glycomics, lipidomics, proteomics, and genomics. It would fill a major gap in contemporary education, be relevant for many areas of science, and facilitate the teaching of important principles of chemistry in the biological sciences, thus helping students to gain a broader understanding of life processes from the molecular to the systemic biology level.

AB The pandemic caused major shifts in the delivery of education worldwide. In the teaching of medical biochemistry, the greatest impact was towards the delivery of traditional laboratory simulations. In this study, we highlight the benefits and barriers encountered in the use of virtual laboratories (vLABs) to substitute traditional laboratory practicals. The subjects were a class of 271 medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, Hasanuddin University, all freshman undergoing the Biomedicine Block. The study assessed the use of a commercial vLAB on antibodies and blood typing procedures, which were implemented using our four-step model of vLAB implementation. Collected data include the lecturer-assigned pre- and post-test result, built-in vLAB assessment result of the student first and best attempts, a student perception questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert scale, and an open ended questionnaire regarding student perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of the vLAB. We observed a remarkable increase of lecturer assigned pre- and post-test scores and built-in first and best attempt scores (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). A majority of students reported increased motivation when using the vLABs, and favored the ability of mastery through repetition. However, technical and language barriers were highlighted by students during the vLAB implementation. We demonstrate a successful implementation of commercial vLABs in a cohort of non-native English speakers using our four-step approach. Implementation requires strong support from faculty to address technical and language barriers that arise during use of vLABs.

AB While science students are well prepared for careers in biotechnology and pharmaceutical sciences in terms of technical expertise and critical thinking, they rarely have an opportunity to practice the due diligence required for success in industry in their coursework. This includes framing their expertise as solutions to challenges a company may be experiencing, an important skill for the interview process. As most academics have not applied for positions in industry, they may feel ill equipped to help students practice the important skills of framing their expertise within company goals and to discuss the business and financial concepts relevant to careers in scientific industry. Here, we describe an educational activity first developed by a leader in the biotech/pharmaceutical industry that was modified and given educational context by an academic in a class of upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. In this guided inquiry activity, students were instructed to select a start-up company in their field-ideally one to which they intended to apply for a job. Students were empowered by scaffolded hands-on exercises to research the company's scientific focus and finances, and to frame how their expertise could help companies achieve stated goals. Students compiled and delivered their research as an in-class presentation.

AB The online environment poses a number of challenges, including creating opportunities for students to interact and get to know each other. I propose adding online discussions that can allow students to explore the real-world implications of biochemistry to provide course context, build the classroom community, diversify student assessment, and practice communication and information literacy skills. Utilizing current events and elements of students' daily lives can help students interconnect what they are learning and increase student interest in the course. These discussions ask students to explore a topic, reflect on what they would like to learn, find information, and report back on what they have learned. Herein I provide an example of a discussion prompt, a table of other potential discussion topics that are aligned with common biochemistry course topics, and results from student survey supporting discussion format.

AB Protein molecular weight standards are routinely employed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to estimate the apparent sizes of unknown proteins within a sample. For training students, a laboratory course based on the production of marker proteins is proposed. Following fractionation by column chromatography, a series of purified proteins and mixtures of proteins were combined to generate various sets of unstained, prestained and fluorescently labeled molecular weight ladders for SDS-PAGE. The produced material can be used in successive laboratory practices as an alternative to commercial protein markers.

AB Ionization of amino acids (AA) is very important concept in biochemistry. We integrate the mathematical concept of probability with biochemically relevant process of AA ionization. We visualize the ionization process with Mathematica software discussing intramolecular interactions between weakly acidic/basic functional groups and charge-pH variation of amino acids in water solution. The visualizations rely on the notion of probability of ionization of functional groups and demonstrate how the extent of ionization and charge varies with pH of the solution. The examples described include amino acids and weak diprotic acids and bases. The aim is to help students better appreciate the importance and consequences of AA ionization and correct some misconceptions.

AB The amplification of nucleic acids is a fundamental tool utilized in various scientific disciplines, including Molecular Biology, Immunology, Microbiology, and Genetics. However, due to the time and technology required for traditional polymerase chain reaction and its derivatives, it is not always possible to include such methodologies in undergraduate laboratory curricula. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a technology that has become increasingly utilized in a variety of laboratory and field settings during the past two decades, is an alternate method of nucleic acid amplification that is rapid, sensitive, and performed under isothermal conditions. We describe an adaptable, inquiry-driven laboratory module that is focused on the detection ofEscherichia coliDNA via LAMP amplification. The main objectives of the module are to introduce students to the principles and protocols of LAMP, to help students develop the ability to apply the scientific method to scientific questions, to guide students as they develop the ability to identify the most appropriate methodology to use in the investigation of scientific questions, and to train students to critically evaluate scientific data, theories, and principles and to articulate their evaluations in both written and oral formats.

AB The Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting assay intends to evaluate the unfolding, denaturation process of DNA secondary structures, and its stabilization using compounds known as DNA binders, some of which are highly specific for G-quadruplex DNAs versus duplex DNAs. First, students determined the melting temperature (T-m) of DNA sequences double labeled with 5 '-FAM (fluorescein) and 3 '-TAMRA (tetramethylrhodamine) in the absence of DNA binders. Second, they determined the melting temperature of the DNAs in the presence of DNA binders by monitoring fluorescence. After completing this experiment, students understood that this method allows a semiquantitative analysis to test a variety of DNA binders against DNA secondary structures, and it can be used to rapidly identify the most promising drug candidates in the drug development stages at the basic research level.

AB In teaching of experiments for medical students, by using the isolation of mononuclear cells and identification of B lymphocytes, an experiment was developed that integrated biochemistry, cytology, and immunology techniques, from which the students performed a series of operations including spleen separation, isolating mononuclear cells, and identifying B lymphocytes. From the immunocytochemistry detection, we included advanced equipment-a flow cytometer-in the experiment, which detected the B lymphocytes more accurately. Moreover, we applied modern information technology to the teaching of experiments by using an internet study platform, micro-lectures, and adopting "formative teaching and evaluation." This lab practice aims to increase the ability of medical students to solve problems using flexible scientific methods, to initiate them thinking about clinical and research application.

AB One of the goals for requiring all college students to take science courses is to develop critical thinking about scientific issues they will encounter as citizens, consumers, and patients. This article integrates skill development activities targeting civic scientific literacy skills in a nonscience majors (liberal arts) biochemistry course, but similar principles could be integrated into nursing and major levels biochemistry courses. Strategies include teaching information acquisition, source analysis argument analysis, and civic engagement. These can be integrated into classroom activities, homework assignments, and outside of class projects. The impact of these activities was assessed through performance on the activities, open ended exam questions, and an end of course survey. Students gained both biochemical content and skills in evaluating claims with evidence, and reported the course helped them better understand what scientists do and how to make decisions based upon scientific evidence without detracting from the typical content learning goals of the course.

AB Often overlooked in many molecular cell biology laboratory and cell culture courses, suspension cells represent an important aspect of molecular cell biology and cell culture. Most primary cell cultures and cell lines are adherent cells which grow in monolayers on surfaces. However, other cells such as hematopoietic cells, certain tumor cells, and cells of the immune system are suspension cells which are anchorage-independent which grow and divide in solution. THP-1 cells are a commercially available, spontaneously immortalized monocyte-like cell line derived from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia. These cells are an excellent model for suspension cell culture and studies of the immune system. Researchers have used THP-1 cells to study the host response to implantable devices and biomaterials in vitro. Tissue contacting surfaces of implantable materials initiate a host inflammatory response characterized by many events, one of which includes macrophage attachment to the surface, which ultimately leads to degradation and failure of the material. Using the THP-1 adhesion assay embedded in this CURE, students can participate in the scientific process by testing substances which may prevent the host inflammatory response to implantable devices and biomaterials.

AB Medical education paradigm has been questioned for the requirements of improving the quality and quantity of medical students. This study was to explore the efficiency of integrated-based learning (IBL) used mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) during physical diagnostics course. One hundred and eleven volunteered students were randomly divided into three groups: lecture-based learning (LBL), case-based learning (CBL), and IBL. Nephrotic syndrome was the teaching content. In the IBL group, students were provided the guideline and additional interpretation from the instructor about the basic knowledge related to disease as vertical integration curriculum. Their performance was evaluated by mini-CEX and theoretical examination, respectively. All subjects have completed the study. The difference of five factors (medical interview, physical examination, clinical judgment, organizational effectiveness, and competence) in mini-CEX between IBL, CBL, and LBL were statistically significant (p <0.05). Sample sizes of below, meets, and above the expectations of mini-CEX in different instructional groups were statistically significant (X-2 =17.842, p =0.001). The final exam scores in IBL group and the CBL group were significantly higher than that of LBL group (F =41.553, p =0.000). And the relationship of final exam score only in the IBL group was positive existed with medical interview (R =0.466, p =0.004), physical examination (R =0.328, p =0.048), professional attitude (R =0.366, p =0.026), and communication skill (R =0.412, p =0.011). Therefore, our study revealed the effect of IBL on the medical students' skills. It highlights IBL could improve the physical examination, organizational effectiveness, and competence and the application of basic knowledge.

AB This work describes the development and evaluation of a two-session laboratory class based on Tet-on technology and sex determination in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The Tet-on system allows conditional control of gene expression, when doxycycline is applied. A laboratory exercise has been developed to illustrate how the Tet-on technology conditionally over-expresses the key sex determining gene transformer (tra) during development and how to inhibit sex differentiation in males, results in a lack of external genitalia and sex comb size reduction. The laboratory practice is inexpensive and straightforward, while allowing students to understand well how molecular biology technology can change biological processes, including development.

ID SYSTEM; SKILLS
AB We have developed an integrated, project-oriented curriculum for undergraduate molecular biology and biochemistry laboratory courses spanning two semesters that is organized around the ldhA gene from the yogurt-fermenting bacterium Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which encodes the enzyme d-lactate dehydrogenase. The molecular biology module, which consists of nine experiments carried out over eleven sessions, begins with the isolation of genomic DNA from L. bulgaricus in yogurt and guides students through the process of cloning the ldhA gene into a prokaryotic expression vector, followed by mRNA isolation and characterization of recombinant gene expression levels using RT-PCR. The biochemistry module, which consists of nine experiments carried out over eight sessions, begins with overexpression of the cloned ldhA gene and guides students through the process of affinity purification, biochemical characterization of the purified LdhA protein, and analysis of enzyme kinetics using various substrates and an inhibitor, concluding with a guided inquiry investigation of structure-function relationships in the three-dimensional structure of LdhA using molecular visualization software. Students conclude by writing a paper describing their work on the project, formatted as a manuscript to be submitted for publication in a scientific journal. Overall, this curriculum, with its emphasis on experiential learning, provides hands-on training with a variety of common laboratory techniques in molecular biology and biochemistry and builds experience with the process of scientific reasoning, along with reinforcement of essential transferrable skills such as critical thinking, information literacy, and written communication, all within the framework of an extended project having the look and feel of a research experience.

ID PERSPECTIVES; REMOVAL
AB Iron metabolism is an important subject of study for undergraduate students of chemistry and biochemistry. Relevant laboratory exercises are scarce in the literature but would be very helpful in assisting students grasp key concepts. The experiment described here deals with different iron release mechanisms of two protagonists in iron metabolism: serum transferrin (Tf) and lactoferrin (Lf). Despite having very similar structures and iron-binding sites, Tf releases practically all its iron at pH 5.5 while Lf requires a significantly lower pH of 3. This difference in behavior is directly related to their respective biological functions as Tf blood-borne iron into the cell, while Lf competes with pathogens to sequester iron in biological fluids at more acidic pHs.
   During this experiment, the students will carry out iron loading and unloading on both human Lf and Tf and monitor the iron release at different pHs using UV-Vis spectroscopy. With this simple approach, the students will discover the different patterns of iron release of Tf and Lf and how this variance in behavior relates to their biological functions. Furthermore, this laboratory practice can be expanded to allow students to investigate a variety of iron proteins. (C) 2017 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB The high degree of complexity of macromolecular structure is extremely difficult for students to process. Students struggle to translate the simplified two-dimensional representations commonly used in biochemistry instruction to three-dimensional aspects crucial in understanding structure-property relationships. We designed four different physical models to address student understanding of electrostatics and noncovalent interactions and their relationship to macromolecular structure. In this study, we have tested these models in classroom settings to determine if these models are effective in engaging students at an appropriate level of difficulty and focusing student attention on the principles of electrostatic attractions. This article describes how to create these unique models for four targeted areas related to macromolecular structure: protein secondary structure, protein tertiary structure, membrane protein solubility, and DNA structure. We also provide evidence that merits their use in classroom settings based on the analysis of assembled models and a behavioral assessment of students enrolled in an introductory biochemistry course. By providing students with three-dimensional models that can be physically manipulated, barriers to understanding representations of these complex structures can be lowered and the focus shifted to addressing the foundational concepts behind these properties.

AB The undergraduate biochemistry laboratory curriculum is designed to provide students with experience in protein isolation and purification protocols as well as various data analysis techniques, which enhance the biochemistry lecture course and give students a broad range of tools upon which to build in graduate level laboratories or once they begin their careers. One of the most common biochemistry protein purification experiments is the isolation and characterization of cytochrome c. Students across the country purify cytochrome c, lysozyme, or some other well-known protein to learn these common purification techniques. What this series of experiments lacks is the use of sophisticated instrumentation that is rarely available to undergraduate students. To give students a broader background in biochemical spectroscopy techniques, a new circular dichroism (CD) laboratory experiment was introduced into the biochemistry laboratory curriculum. This CD experiment provides students with a means of conceptualizing the secondary structure of their purified protein, and assessments indicate that students' understanding of the technique increased significantly. Students conducted this experiment with ease and in a short time frame, so this laboratory is conducive to merging with other data analysis techniques within a single laboratory period.

AB Assessment plays a critical role in learning and teaching and its power to enhance engagement and student outcomes is still underestimated in tertiary education. The current project considers the impact of a staged redesign of an assessment strategy that emphasized relevance of learning, formative assessment, student engagement, and feedback on student performance, failure rates and overall engagement in the course. Significant improvements in final grades (p<0.0001) and written performance (p<0.0001) in the final examination were noted that coincided with increased lecture attendance and overall engagement in the course. This study reinforces the importance of an integrated approach to assessment that includes well developed formative tasks and a continuous summative assessment strategy.

AB Assessment instruments designed to measure student conceptual understanding and skills proficiency related to biochemistry are important to transform undergraduate biochemistry education. The purpose of this study was to develop an assessment instrument to measure student understanding of protein structure and enzyme inhibition in a new context, that of saturable binding. A community of biochemistry educators was involved in an iterative process of designing and testing of this assessment, which consists of true/false and open-ended questions that map to low and high levels in Bloom's taxonomy. A total of 188 students' responses were collected from seven different institutions and were graded by two independent raters using a rubric. Results from this administration indicate that most students were able to answer the questions related to lower-levels in Bloom's taxonomy; however for higher-level questions, students had more difficulty. The results from this assessment can give instructors insight into the ways in which persistent incorrect or incomplete ideas related to protein structure and binding events can hinder knowledge application. Also, the use of a community of practice to develop assessment instruments of this type and the format of the instrument itself could be a useful model for development of assessment instruments in the future.

AB There are barriers to adoption of research-based teaching methods. Professional development workshops may inform faculty of these methods, but effective adoption often does not follow. In addition, newly-minted research-active faculty are often overwhelmed by the many new responsibilities (grant writing, group management, laboratory setup, teaching) that accompany the position and normally do not have the time to consider novel teaching approaches. This case study documents how over a three-year period, the responsibility for teaching a nontraditional "Introduction to Biochemistry" course in a problem-based learning format was successfully transferred from a senior faculty member nearing retirement (HBW) to a newly-hired research-active assistant professor (CLG). We describe our apprenticeship project involving modeling, scaffolding, fading, and coaching. We suggest that involving faculty in active-learning pedagogy early in their career with mentoring by senior faculty overcomes barriers to adopting these methods. This case describes a specific example from which potentially useful elements can be adopted and adapted wherever biochemistry is taught.

AB The huge increase in data being produced in the genomic era has produced a need to incorporate computers into the research process. Sequence generation, its subsequent storage, interpretation, and analysis are now entirely computer-dependent tasks. Universities from all over the world have been challenged to seek a way of encouraging students to incorporate computational and bioinformatics skills since undergraduation in order to understand biological processes. The aim of this article is to report the experience of awakening students' interest in bioinformatics tools during a course focused on comparative modeling of proteins. The authors start by giving a full description of the course environmental context and students' backgrounds. Then they detail each class and present a general overview of the protein modeling protocol. The positive and negative aspects of the course are also reported, and some of the results generated in class and in projects outside the classroom are discussed. In the last section of the article, general perspectives about the course from students' point of view are given. This work can serve as a guide for professors who teach subjects for which bioinformatics tools are useful and for universities that plan to incorporate bioinformatics into the curriculum.

AB Before the outbreak of World War II, Jeffries Wyman postulated that the Bohr effect in hemoglobin demanded the oxygen linked dissociation of the imidazole of two histidines of the polypeptide. This proposal emerged from a rigorous analysis of the acidbase titration curves of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, at a time when the information on the chemistry and structure of the protein was essentially nil. The magnetochemical properties of hemoglobin led Linus Pauling to hypothesize that the (so called) Bohr histidines were coordinated to the heme iron in the fifth and sixth positions; and Wyman shared this opinion. However, this structural hypothesis was abandoned in 1951 when J. Wyman and D. W. Allen proposed the pK shift of the oxygen linked histidines to be the result of a change of configuration of the hemoglobin molecule as a whole accompanying oxygenation. This shift in paradigm, that was published well before the 3D structure of hemoglobin was solved by M.F. Perutz, paved the way to the concept of allostery. After 1960 the availability of the crystallographic structure opened new horizons to the interpretation of the allosteric properties of hemoglobin.

AB Mutate is a program developed for teaching purposes to impart a virtual laboratory class for undergraduate students of Genetics in Biology. The program emulates the so-called fluctuation test whose aim is to distinguish between spontaneous and adaptive mutation hypotheses in bacteria. The plan is to train students in certain key multidisciplinary aspects of current genetics such as sequence databases, DNA mutations, and hypothesis testing, while introducing the fluctuation test. This seminal experiment was originally performed studying Escherichia coli resistance to the infection by bacteriophage T1. The fluctuation test initiated the modern bacterial genetics that 25 years later ushered in the era of the recombinant DNA. Nowadays we know that some deletions in fhuA, the gene responsible for E. coli membrane receptor of T1, could cause the E. coli resistance to this phage. For the sake of simplicity, we will introduce the assumption that a single mutation generates the resistance to T1. During the practical, the students use the program to download some fhuA gene sequences, manually introduce some stop codon mutations, and design a fluctuation test to obtain data for distinguishing between preadaptative (spontaneous) and induced (adaptive) mutation hypotheses. The program can be launched from a browser or, if preferred, its executable file can be downloaded from . It requires the Java 5.0 (or higher) Runtime Environment (freely available at ).

AB Student-centered education involving research experiences or inquiry have been shown to help undergraduate students understand, and become excited about, the process of scientific investigation. These benefits are particularly important for students in the early stages of their degree (Report and Kenny, ). However, embedding such experiences into the curriculum is particularly difficult when dealing with early stage students, who are in larger cohorts and often lack the background content knowledge necessary to engage with primary research literature and research level methods and equipment. We report here the design, delivery, assessment, and subsequent student learning outcomes of a 4-week practical module for 120 students at the beginning of their second year of university, which successfully engages students in designing cell culture experiments and in understanding the molecular processes and machinery involved in the basic cellular process of macropinocytosis.

DE Peptide bond synthesis; ribosome; scientific discourse; critical

ID SCIENCE; RNA
AB Argumentation and discourse are two integral parts of scientific investigation that are often overlooked in undergraduate science education. To address this limitation, the story of peptide bond formation by the ribosome can be used to illustrate the importance of evidence, claims, arguments, and counterarguments in scientific discourse. With the determination of the first structure of the large ribosomal subunit bound to a transition state inhibitor came an initial hypothesis about the role of the ribosome in peptide bond formation. This initial hypothesis was based on a few central assumptions about the transition state mimic and acid-base catalysis by serine proteases. The initial proposed mechanism started a flurry of scientific discourse in experimental articles and commentaries that tested the validity of the initial proposed mechanism. Using this civil argumentation as a guide, class discussions, assignments, and a debate were designed that allow students to analyze and question the claims and evidence about the mechanism of peptide bond synthesis. In the end, students develop a sense of critical skepticism, and an understanding of scientific discourse, while learning about the current consensus mechanism for peptide bond synthesis.

AB Many faculty members in science departments are experiencing pressure to improve their courses, particularly with respect to the ways in which students are taught and assessed. The purpose of this article is to provide some insights and practical ideas on how curriculum change can be brought about-how motivated individuals can become agents of change. Change almost always elicits opposing and supporting forces, examples of which are given. Finally, we discuss examples of strategies to deal with these forces and highlight various factors that need to be considered when implementing such strategies, including the concepts of a zone of feasible innovation, the zone of tolerance, and the development of communities of practice.

AB The genes responsible for luminescence in various species of the marine microorganism Photobacterium, have been used for many years as a tool by researchers and instructors. In particular, the lux operon of Photobacterium fischeri has been used by many instructors to teach recombinant DNA techniques. Two methods using an automated plate reader and multiwell plates were applied to a set of previously-published exercises. In these exercises that involve transfer of lux genes to Escherichia coli to create a luminescent phenotype, this technology was used to screen for Lux(+) colonies. It was found to be more convenient and more sensitive than the previously used method; that is, assaying bacterial plates by direct observation. Eight students synthesized four genomic libraries and isolated six Lux(+) clones. The fluorescent-detection feature of the plate reader was used to verify amplification of target sequence in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions. Lux(+) E. coli colony lysates were examined. An exonuclease-activated, fluorescent DNA probe generated a signal on hybridization to an amplified portion of the luxA gene in each lysate tested. This method is suggested as a means of demonstrating the concept of real-time PCR without the expense of the specialized device typically used for this technique.

ID EXPRESSION
AB A key goal of molecular/cell biology/biotechnology is to identify essential genes in virtually every physiological process to uncover basic mechanisms of cell function and to establish potential targets of drug therapy combating human disease. This article describes a semester-long, project-oriented molecular/cellular/biotechnology laboratory providing students, within a framework of bone cell biology, with a modern approach to gene discovery. Students are introduced to the topics of bone cells, bone synthesis, bone resorption, and osteoporosis. They then review the theory of microchip gene arrays, and study microchip array data generated during the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts in vitro. The class selects genes whose expression increases during osteoclastogenesis, and researches them in small groups using web-based bioinformatics tools. Students then go to a biotechnology company website to find and order small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) designed to "knockdown'' expression of the gene of interest. Students then learn to transfect these siRNAs into osteoclasts, stimulate the cells to differentiate, assay osteoclast differentiation in vitro, and measure specific gene expression using real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Specific siRNA knockdown resulting in a decrease in osteoclastogenesis is indicative of a gene's physiological relevance. The results are analyzed statistically and presented to the class in groups. In the past 2 years, students identified several genes essential for optimal osteoclast differentiation, including Myo1d. The students hypothesize that the myo1d protein functions in osteoclasts to deliver important proteins to the cell surface via vesicular transport along microfilaments. Student response to the new course was overwhelmingly positive.

AB A successful laboratory experience provides the foundation for student success, creating active participation in the learning process. Here, we describe a new approach that emphasizes research, inquiry and problem solving in a year-long biochemistry experience. The first semester centers on the purification, characterization, and analysis of a novel fusion protein within a guided research experience. Throughout the semester, students gradually acquire skills as they are allowed to work independently. A fusion protein, malate dehydrogenase-green fluorescent protein with a histidine affinity tag (MGH), is used throughout the semester. The fusion protein allows for a high throughput analysis and is stable for duration of the semester. Students start with the purification and analysis of the plasmid DNA and end with an enzymatic analysis of MGH. As students take ownership of their experiments and choose two different chromatographic resins, they make many choices throughout the semester. Skills, motivation, confidence levels, and attitudes were assessed before and after the semester. Students achieved high levels of critical biochemical laboratory skills and critical thinking while increasing their confidence and motivation for working in a biochemical research setting.

AB Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) integrate active, discovery-based learning into undergraduate curricula, adding tremendous value to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) education. There are multiple challenges in transforming a research project into a CURE, such as the readiness of students, the time commitment of the instructor, and the productivity of the research. In this article, we report a CURE course developed and offered in the University of Massachusetts Amherst BMB Department since 2018 that addresses these challenges. Our CURE focuses on fungal effectors which are proteins secreted by a destructive pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum, one of the top five most devastating plant pathogens. By studying this group of proteins, students are connected to real-world problems and participate in the search for potential solutions. A 3-week "standard Boot Camp" is implemented to help students familiarize themselves with all basic techniques and boost their confidence. Next, molecular cloning, a versatile technique with modularity and repeatability, is used as the bedrock of the course. Our past 5 years of experience have confirmed that we have developed a novel and feasible CURE protocol. Measurable progress documented by students who took this course includes stimulated active learning and increased career trajectory to pursue hypothesis-based research to address societal needs. In addition, data generated through the course advance ongoing lab research. Collectively, we encourage the implementation of CURE among research-intensive faculty to provide a more inclusive research experience to undergraduate students, an important element in predicting career success.

AB The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted undergraduate students' experiments since their access to the laboratory is limited. To address this problem, the bacteria and detergent residues on undergraduate students' dinner plates were investigated by the students in the dormitories. Five different types of dinner plates from 50 students were collected, which were cleaned with detergent and water in the same way and naturally dried. Then, Escherichia coli (E. coli) test papers and sodium dodecyl sulfonate test kits were used to understand the bacteria and detergent residuals. Commonly available equipment such as a yogurt maker was used for bacterial culture; detergent analyses were performed using centrifugation tubes. Effective sterilization methods and safety protection were achieved by dormitory available methods. According to the investigated results, the students found the differences in bacteria and detergent residuals between different dinner plates and made suitable choices for the future.

AB This study aimed to explore the strengths and weaknesses of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of its primary stakeholders, namely professors and students, and to provide practical solutions. Design is a qualitative study. We enrolled 22 faculty members and 58 students purposively. Research data were collected through a data collection checklist and via email and continued until the data were saturated. The qualitative content analyses were the basis of analysis in this study. Strengths were presented in 6 themes and 26 subthemes, weaknesses in 5 themes and 23 subthemes, and solutions were presented in 5 themes and 20 subthemes. Save money, time and energy; use modern software and educational technologies; and the ability to individualize education were among the strengths of e-learning. The most important weaknesses related to e-learning include infrastructure difficulties, problems related to the ability of professors and students to use educational systems. The most beneficial solutions offered included improving and upgrading the e-learning infrastructure, empowering professors and students to use educational systems. We concluded that using online teaching has many strengths as well as some weaknesses. Identifying these strengths and weaknesses can help policymakers plan better.

AB The R programming language and computing environment is a powerful and common platform used by life science researchers and educators for the analysis of big data. One of the benefits of using R in this context is its ability to visualize the results. Using R to generate visualizations has gained in popularity due to the increased number of R packages available to convert data to graphic display. In this paper, I ask the following question: how can student engagement with protein analysis be promoted using R-based visualizations in the classroom? During the 2021 IUBMB/ASBMD workshop "Teaching Science with Big Data", I presented a teaching strategy that used R for the visualization of protein data. In this report, I provide a teaching procedure and a summary of how students engaged with these data in our Introduction to R for Professional Data Science class. This report is based on a case study methodology by reviewing student peer comments for protein analyses conducted in R. The results indicated that students were active participants in the peer-review process and that they learned to take a critical view of data visualization.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the education of international students. The authors taught a molecular biology course using the DingTalk platform for international medical students (IMS) in the autumn semester of 2020. We assessed the effect of this online teaching based on an online questionnaire and by analysis of the final examination scores. Our findings demonstrate that the DingTalk platform is a free, effective and convenient online teaching tool for international students. The students' feedback showed that most of them were satisfied with this live teaching with DingTalk. They considered who viewed that the questions used in the live classroom setting were helpful for their learning. There is nonetheless still scope to improve this online teaching mode for international students, such as providing more pre-recorded teaching videos for offline application and use of a virtual simulation experimental molecular biology course. We hope that our findings regarding the experience of IMS with this teaching mode will be of value to other academic faculty.

AB Active teaching methodologies have been placed as a hope for changing education at different levels, transiting from passive lecture-centered to student-centered learning. With the health measures of social distance, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a strong shift to remote education. With the challenge of delivering quality education through a computer screen, we validated and applied an online course model using active teaching tools for higher education. We incorporated published active-learning strategies into an online construct, with problem-based inquiry and design of inquiry research projects to serve as our core active learning tool. The gains related to students' science learning experiences and their attitudes toward science were assessed by applying questionnaires before, during, and after the course. The course counted on the participation of 83 students, most of them (60.8%) from postgraduate students. Our results show that engagement provided by active learning methods can improve performance both in hard and soft skills. Students' participation seems to be more relevant when activities require the interaction of information, prediction, and reasoning, such as open-ended questions and design of research projects. Therefore, our data show that, in pandemic, active learning tools benefit students and improve their critical thinking and their motivation and positive positioning in science.

AB The aim of this online workshop is to familiarize biomedical faculties students with the principle of RT-PCR method. The following assumption is made, students participating in the workshop:
   are already familiar with the principle of PCR reaction,
   can distinguish PCR from RT-PCR,
   know the basic possibilities of using the above techniques.
   During the online workshop participants are supposed to learn the interpretation of PCR and RT-PCR results and to understand the crucial importance of controlling the reaction conditions. The workshop involves active students' learning, critical analysis of the data, group discussion, brainstorming method, involvement of e-tools such as pool everywhere or e-learning platforms, as well as interpreting the real-life example results that allows putting the topic in the proper future work-related tasks. The final part of the workshop focuses on the analysis of the RT-PCR results performed in order to confirm or exclude the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in potentially infected individuals. The students are expected to see the practical/work-related part of the knowledge gained during the workshop.

AB This song deals with oxidosqualene cyclases, a class of enzymes that catalyze among the most fascinating and complex monoenzymatic reactions. While in photosynthetic eukaryotes there are dozens of different oxidosqualene cyclases that form a plethora of different cyclization products, in non-photosynthetic organisms, fungi and animals (vertebrates), the only product of cyclization is lanosterol, precursor of ergosterol and cholesterol, respectively. Therefore, in these organisms, the only oxidosqualene cyclase present is lanosterol synthase. Since all the steroid compounds occurring in vertebrates (bile salts, steroid hormones, neuroactive steroids, etc.) derive from cholesterol, they all owe their tetracyclic structure to the action of this enzyme. In the cyclization process of lanosterol synthase, what happens between the initial protonation and the final deprotonation is truly amazing: four rings are formed, several chiral centres are created, a positive charge travels through the triterpene skeleton of the substrate back and forth, and methyls and hydrides literally dance from one position to another. The structural comparison between the starting substrate and the final product is absolutely outstanding. It is, therefore, not surprising that such a fascinating enzyme was called "The Lord of the Rings". To this Lord, the present poem is dedicated, composed of seven stanzas, which can be sung on a well-known Christmas melody. To grasp well the different steps of the catalytic process described by the stanzas, one can resort to the numerous images available on the web.

AB Colleges and universities are learning to provide relevant virtual lab experiences for students due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even schools attempting in-person instruction often need to utilize virtual experiences for students absent due to quarantine or illness. Much of biochemistry is amenable to molecular visualization and/or computational study; however, many faculty face learning how to utilize new computational and molecular visualization software. We present a set of virtual lab exercises with detailed instructions to engage students in the discovery of novel antiviral compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

AB The rapid development of molecular biotechnology presents a curricular challenge for educators trying to provide students with relevant coursework. A comprehensive biology education should also include opportunities for students to develop intellectual and technical skills through authentic research experiences. Integrating relevant and interesting research projects into their classes, however, can be a challenging task for instructors. To address these varied demands, we redesigned our existing molecular cloning course to incorporate an independent research project assessing calcium signaling. In the revised course, students use traditional and recombination-based cloning strategies to generate bacterial and mammalian expression vectors encodingCaMPARI, a novel fluorescent calcium indicator. Bacterially-expressed CaMPARI is used in protein quantification and purification assays. Students must also design their own research project evaluating the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on calcium signaling in a mammalian system. Revised and novel labs were designed to be modular, facilitating their integration into the course over 2 years. End-of-semester student evaluations were compared between years revealing a significant difference in students' perception of the course's difficulty between years. This change in attitude highlights potential pedagogical considerations that must be examined when introducing new material and activities into existing courses. Since calcium signaling is important for cellular process across diverse species, instructors may be able to develop research projects within their respective areas of interest. Integration of authentic research experiences into the curriculum is challenging; however, the framework described here provides a versatile structure that can be adapted to merge diverse instructor interests with evolving educational needs.

AB Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are used widely in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and clinical medicine labs. At the same time, they appear to be underrepresented in chemistry and biochemistry curricula, even though their sensitivity, selectivity, and ease of use would argue for their widespread use. We describe here an online ELISA activity suitable for stand-alone use or in conjunction with an actual wet lab ELISA. Specifically, we offer real and mock data for a hypothetical ELISA to detect plasma antibodies to COVID-19 in infected patients who have had the disease. Much of the activity focuses on chemical and mathematical models to fit ELISA or any macromolecule/ligand binding data, a skill that addresses perhaps the most relevant and difficult learning goal of an ELISA experiment.

AB The use of the thermodynamic formalism in the investigation of biochemical reactions constitutes one of the key analysis in bioenergetics, and the first step in such analysis is the selection of the adequate reference state. For biochemistry majors, thermodynamic analysis based on the chemical reference state is used in Physical Chemistry courses, while the biological and biochemical reference states are used in Biochemistry courses. As these definitions are introduced in different courses, it is difficult that students can understand the need to select a reference state as a first step in the energy analysis of a system. The lack of suitable examples in textbooks to illustrate the importance of the adequate selection of the reference state in a thermodynamic analysis, promoted the present analysis of the energetic role of pyrophosphate (PPi) in comparison with adenosine-triphosphate in different ambient conditions, namely, the early PPi world (better described by the chemical reference state), the enclosed systems like the cells (better described by the biological reference state), and the actual thioester world (better described by the biochemical reference state). This example not only provides a new interesting point of view on the evolution of two biochemical fuels but also represents a biochemical example in which the use of different reference states can illustrate a single process from different points of views.

AB Undergraduate biochemistry students frequently find the quantitative treatment of weak acids and bases troublesome. Given the pK(a) of a weak acid HA, for instance, many students struggle to calculate the pH of a solution of the conjugate base A(-) at concentration C, pH(A(-), C). The traditional method involves calculating the base dissociation constant K-b and the artificial quantity pOH before reaching pH, but these steps increase the risk of mistakes and provide little insight into acid-base equilibria. The alternative method presented here allows students to calculate the pH of a weak base solution from the pK(a) of its conjugate acid without calculating K-b and pOH, using a memorable relationship: pH(HA, C) + pH(A(-), C) = pK(a) + 7.

AB Biochemistry learning in higher education not only aims to allow students to remember the concepts learned, but also to achieve meaningful learning. This study examines the implementation of the multilevel inquiry approach in order to achieve meaningful biochemistry learning. Such as approach begins with a structured inquiry, leading to a guided inquiry, and ending with an open inquiry on topics that are connected to each other. A posttest-only control group design was employed, with a total sample of 87 students taking biochemistry courses. The control class consisted of 43 students, with 44 students in the experimental class. The variables tested were learning outcomes, practical skills, and attitudes toward biochemistry, while the effect of the implementation of multilevel inquiry on these three variables was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The results show that the class that applied the multilevel inquiry approach achieved higher scores in all three variables than the control class. The MANOVA test shows that the implementation of this approach has a positive effect on the three variables, which represent the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains, and that multilevel inquiry was able to foster meaningful learning in biochemistry courses.

AB Successful learning of biochemistry requires students to engage with the material. In the past this often involved students writing out pathways by hand, and more recently directing students to online resources such as videos, songs, and animated slide presentations. However, even these latter resources do not really provide students an opportunity to engage with the material in an active fashion. As part of an online introductory metabolism course that was developed at our university, we created a series of twelve online interactive activities using Adobe Captivate 9. These activities targeted glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen metabolism, the citric acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. The interactive exercises consisted of two types. One involved dragging objects such as names of enzymes or allosteric modifiers to their correct drop locations such as a particular point in a metabolic pathway, a specific enzyme, and so forth. A second type involved clicking on objects, locations within a pathway, and so forth, in response to a particular question. In both types of exercises, students received feedback on their decisions in order to enhance learning. The student feedback received on these activities was very positive, and indicated that they found them to increase their confidence in the material and that they had learned the key principles of each pathway.

AB Problem-based learning (PBL) is a unique form of pedagogy dedicated to developing students' self-learning and clinical practice skills. After several decades of development, although applications vary, PBL has been recognized all over the world and implemented by many medical schools. This review summarizes and updates the application and study of PBL in medical education through the literature published between 1993 and early 2017. It focuses on understanding real medical PBL courses and ways to improve PBL to achieve better learning outcomes. PBL aims to develop lifelong skills to solve practical problems rather than limiting learning to theoretical knowledge. To achieve this goal, strict and reasonable procedures need to be designed and implemented. Rigorous monitoring and timely feedback and evaluation are indispensable to constant improvements and perfecting of the process.

AB This article describes efforts aimed at improving comprehension and retention of complex molecular mechanisms commonly studied in undergraduate biology and biochemistry courses. The focus is on the design of appropriate assessments, an active classroom emphasizing formative practice, and more effective out-of-class study habits. Assessments that require students to articulate their understanding through writing are the most effective. Frequent formative practice improves performance on problems that require intellectual transfer, the ability to apply conceptual principles in novel settings. We show that success with such problems is a function of mastery of the intrinsic logic of the biology in play, not variations in the way they are written. Survey data demonstrate that many students would prefer a learning style not dominated by memorization of factual details, but how to develop a more effective strategy is rarely intuitive. Matching individual students with specific learning styles has not proven useful. Instead, teachers can strongly promote individual metacognitive appraisal during both classroom activities and other study environments.

AB Subject material concerning Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA) structure in the format of creativity-driven laboratory practice offers meaningful learning experience to the students. Therefore, a laboratory practice in which utilizes simple procedures and easy-safe-affordable household materials should be promoted to students to develop their creativity. This study aimed to examine whether designing and conducting DNA extraction with household materials could foster students' creative thinking. We also described how this laboratory practice affected students' knowledge and views. A total of 47 students participated in this study. These students were grouped and asked to utilize available household materials and modify procedures using hands-on worksheet. Result showed that this approach encouraged creative thinking as well as improved subject-related knowledge. Students also demonstrated positive views about content knowledge, social skills, and creative thinking skills. This study implies that extracting DNA with household materials is able to develop content knowledge, social skills, and creative thinking of the students.

AB Analyzing protein structure has become an integral aspect of understanding systems of biochemical import. The laboratory experiment endeavors to introduce protein folding to ascertain structures of proteins for which the structure is unavailable, as well as to critically evaluate the quality of the prediction obtained. The model system used is the highly mutable influenza virus protein neuraminidase, which is the key target in the development of therapeutics. In light of recent pandemics, understanding how mutations confer drug resistance, which translates at the molecular level to understanding how different sequence variants differ, constitutes an area of great interest because of the ramifications in public health. This lab targets upper level undergraduate biochemistry students, and aims to introduce tools to be used to explore protein folding and protein visualization in the context of the neuraminidase case study. Students proceed to critically evaluate the folded models by comparison with crystallographic structures. When validity is established, they fold a neuraminidase sequence for which a structure is not available. Through structural alignment and visual inspection of the 150 loop, students gain molecular insight into two possible conformations of the protein, which are actively being studied. Folding the third chosen sequence mimics a true research environment in allowing students to generate a structure from a sequence for which a structure was not previously available, and to assess whether their particular variant has an open or closed loop. From this vantage, they are then challenged to speculate about the connection between loop conformation and drug susceptibility.

AB This laboratory exercise presents a novel way to introduce undergraduate students to the specific detection of enzymatic activity by electrophoresis. First, students prepare a crude peroxidase extract and then analyze the homogenate via electrophoresis. Zymography, that is, a SDS-PAGE method to detect enzyme activity, is used to specifically detect peroxidase activity and furthermore, to analyze the total protein profile. After the assay, students may estimate the apparent molecular mass of the enzyme and discuss its structure. After the 4-h experiment, students gain knowledge concerning biological sample preparation, gel preparation, electrophoresis, and the importance of specific staining procedures for the detection of enzymatic activity.

DT Article
DE undergraduate; analogy role play; central dogma
AB For the study of biology in an undergraduate classroom, a classroom exercise was developed: an analogy role-play to learn mechanisms of gene transcription and protein translation (central dogma). To develop the central dogma role-play exercise, we made DNA and mRNA using paper sheets, tRNA using a wire dress hanger, and amino acids using Lego (R) blocks (Lego System A/S, Denmark). Students were studying in the course of mathematics, physics, or chemistry, so biology was not among their usual studies. In this exercise, students perform the central dogma role-play and respectively act out nuclear matrix proteins, a transcription factor, an RNA polymerase II, an mRNA transport protein, nuclear pore proteins, a large ribosomal subunit, a small ribosomal subunit, and several amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. Questionnaire results obtained after the activity show that this central dogma role-play analogy holds student interest in the practical molecular biological processes of transcription and translation.

ID LECTIN
AB This laboratory class combines molecular visualization and laboratory experimentation to teach the structure of the immunoglobulins (Ig). In the first part of the class, the three-dimensional structures of the human IgG and IgM molecules available through the RCSB PDB database are visualized using freely available software. In the second part, IgG and IgM are studied using electrophoretic methods. Through SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions, the students determine the number and molecular masses of the polypeptide chains, while through SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, the students assess the oligomerization of these Ig molecules. The aims of this class are to expand upon the knowledge and understanding of the Ig structure that the students have gained from classroom lectures. The combination of this molecular visualization of the Ig molecules and the SDS-PAGE experimentation ensures variety in the teaching techniques, while the implication of the Ig molecules in human disease promotes interest for biomedical students.

AB Mobile learning (m-learning) is a relevant innovation in teaching and learning in higher education. A mobile app called NutriBiochem was developed for use in biochemistry and nutrition education for students in a second year Biochemistry and Metabolism course. NutriBiochem was accessed through smartphones, tablets, or computers. Students were surveyed upon completion of the final exam (n=88). Survey questions assessed frequency of use, motivations for use, and perceptions of app usefulness. The pedagogical impact of NutriBiochem was evaluated by measuring the relationship between frequency of use and final course grade. Just over half of the students used the app, and approximate to 80% of users accessed the app moderately or infrequently. Smartphones were the most common device and the preferred device on which to access the app. There were no statistical differences in mean final grade between users and nonusers. Students with higher comfort levels with technology accessed the app more broadly than those with lower level of comfort with technology. Over 75% of students agreed that NutriBiochem was a useful learning tool, but fewer (approximate to 45%) felt it helped them perform better in the course. The findings of this study are important, as they suggest that NutriBiochem is an effective study tool for students who are comfortable with technology, and access it regularly. Overall, the use of mobile applications in science education has been shown to be: 1) effective in enhancing students' learning experience; 2) relevant and important as an emergent method of learning given modern pressures facing higher education; and, 3) met with positive student attitudes and perceptions in terms of adopting and using such technology for educational purposes.

AB The Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission (FEPAC) requires accredited programs offer a coherent curriculum to ensure each student gains a thorough grounding of the natural...sciences. Part of this curriculum includes completion of a minimum of 15 semester-hours forensic science coursework, nine of which can involve a class in forensic DNA biology. Departments that have obtained or are pursuing FEPAC accreditation can meet this requirement by offering a stand-alone forensic DNA biology course; however, materials necessary to instruct students are often homegrown and not standardized; in addition, until recently, the community lacked commercially available books, lab manuals, and teaching materials, and many of the best pedagogical resources were scattered across various peer-reviewed journals. The curriculum discussed below is an attempt to synthesize this disparate information, and although certainly not the only acceptable methodology, the below discussion represents a way for synthesizing and aggregating this information into a cohesive, comprehensive whole.

DE single nucleotide polymorphisms; DNA sequencing; genotyping
AB In this report, we describe a 5-week laboratory exercise for undergraduate biology and biochemistry students in which students learn to sequence DNA and to genotype their DNA for selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Students use miniaturized DNA sequencing gels that require approximately 8 min to run. The students perform G, A, T, C Sanger sequencing reactions. They prepare and run the gels, perform Southern blots (which require only 10 min), and detect sequencing ladders using a colorimetric detection system. Students enlarge their sequencing ladders from digital images of their small nylon membranes, and read the sequence manually. They compare their reads with the actual DNA sequence using BLAST2. After mastering the DNA sequencing system, students prepare their own DNA from a cheek swab, polymerase chain reaction-amplify a region of their DNA that encompasses a SNP of interest, and perform sequencing to determine their genotype at the SNP position. A family pedigree can also be constructed. The SNP chosen by the instructor was rs17822931, which is in the ABCC11 gene and is the determinant of human earwax type. Genotypes at the rs178229931 site vary in different ethnic populations. (c) 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 41(6):388-395, 2013

AB Peer reviews are the generally accepted mode of quality assessment in scholarly communities; however, they are rarely used for evaluation at college levels. Over a period of 5 years, we have performed a peer review simulation at a senior level course in molecular genetics at the University of Guelph and have accumulated 393 student peer reviews. We have used these to generate a summary of the metrics of this exercise. Our calculations show that student peer marks are highly variable and not suitable for numerical performance evaluation at the university level. On the other hand, student peer reviews can clearly recognize substandard performance. Hence, peer reviews can be used for the assessment of pass/fail type of assignments. Interestingly, student peers struggle to distinguish between good and excellent performance. These finding provide provocative insight on the process of peer review in general. We comment on the implications of this in-class simulation for research communities and on potential pitfalls of peer reviews.

AB Open-ended, inquiry-based multiweek laboratory exercises are the key elements to increasing students' understanding and retention of the major biological concepts. Including original research into undergraduate teaching laboratories has also been shown to motivate students and improve their learning. Here, we present a series of original laboratory exercises on fine mapping novel maize mutations producing interesting phenotypes. In this 4-week lab series, students get involved in the whole process of identifying novel genes controlling specific phenotypes, from phenotype characterization and choosing appropriate molecular markers to calculating the genetic distance between the mutation and the marker and finding possible candidate genes using a complete genome sequence. We chose to use maize mutant lines produced by TILLING project. These lines have been partially mapped to a chromosomal bin by a high-throughput bulk segregant analysis; however, the exact map positions for these mutations have never been determined. Mapping these novel maize mutations provides students with the opportunity to conduct original research as a part of their classroom experience and to contribute to the field of maize genetics. The laboratory series was well received by the students, and the assessment results demonstrated an improvement of student learning of gene mapping, molecular marker analysis, and positional cloning concepts.

AB Teaching students about the structure and function of proteins is central to Biochemistry, but it is often extremely difficult to impart an understanding of complex three-dimensional relationships when using two-dimensional projection screens. The ready availability of both high-quality molecular visualization software and programs capable of generating anaglyph images makes it possible to bring spatial relationships to life with three-dimensional images using standard projection facilities and inexpensive red/cyan glasses; 3D graphical representations make a simple, economical, and effective addition to the graphical tools used in teaching Biochemistry.

AB Although there is a need for continued pedagogical advancement in science undergraduate education, what is needed more urgently is more widespread adaptation of pedagogical practices that research has already shown to promote learning. Those practices include interactive engagement pedagogies such as active learning and inquiry-based learning. The need now is to find ways to integrate and institutionalize these evidence-based strategies for teaching science and to help science faculty learn about and implement them. Scientific Teaching Learning Communities (STLCs) create a culture that values scholarly teaching within science departments, important for bridging the gap between science and education and for improving undergraduate science learning. Evidence for the impact of STLCs on the student-learning environment was obtained through the development and use of the Participant Assessment of Learning Gains survey, an adaptation of the online Student Assessment of Learning Gains survey originally developed by Seymour et al. (Available at: http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/salgains/instructor/SALGains.asp, 1997 and Paper presented at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, 2000). Data reveal how STLCs are transforming faculty behavior and directly affecting what they do in their science classrooms.

AB Nowadays there is a concern to improve the quality of education by including an interdisciplinary approach of concepts and their integration in the curriculum of scientific disciplines. The development of microbial fuel cells as a potential alternative for production of renewable energies gives undergraduate students the challenge of integrating interdisciplinary concepts in a hot topic of global interest as alternative energies. We present a laboratory experiment that has been part of a third-year undergraduate course in biology where students gained experience in assembling microbial fuel cells and the understanding of how they work. In this process, the students could integrate biological, biochemical, and electric concepts. In addition, the acquisition of manual skills and experimental design decisions are important for the development of future professionals.

ID SELF-EFFICACY
AB Journal clubs are well regarded as a highly effective means of engaging graduate students with the contemporary research literature, where individual students prepare and deliver presentations on selected research articles to their peers, followed by a group discussion. Regular journal clubs have the advantage of enhancing student scientific reading, assessment and communication skills as well as developing a better understanding of the field. We developed a flipped journal club program as part of the one semester module 'Genomics Research Methods' with the goal of enhancing-and quantifying-individual student ability to engage with the genomics scientific literature. This involves all students and faculty reviewing a given manuscript, with the former submitting research relevant questions they would wish to ask the presenting student at the journal club, and the latter grading them. These questions are then ranked based on their median grade, and subsequently discussed in class. This cycle repeats weekly until all students have presented. Our analysis of question grade data over three consecutive years demonstrated clear improvements in student performance for all students between the start and end of the module. While no difference in performance was noted based on gender over the full semester, improvement in performance was significantly evident for the female cohort between the start and end of the module. Our results are consistent with module survey feedback of overall reported enhanced research self-efficacy. This demonstrates that this flipped journal club implementation is a highly effective means of both assessing and improving individual student learning in genomics research ability. The involvement of the teaching faculty furthermore offers a means to foster a dynamic research community for all participants involved. This methodology is easily transferable to other bioscience graduate/undergraduate programs seeking to effectively teach essential research ability skills and enhance student self-efficacy.

AB Biology is a data-driven discipline facilitated greatly by computer programming skills. This article describes an introductory experiential programming activity that can be integrated into distance learning environments. Students are asked to develop their own Python programs to identify the nature of alleles linked to disease. This activity effectively engages students in a problem solving exercise that provides an opportunity for application of basic programming skills as well as understanding eukaryotic gene structure. We provide sets of mapped alleles for two well-known genes, CFTR and HFE, as well as a suite of relevant Python programs to achieve these outcomes or allow subsequent exercise modifications.

AB Due to its distinct phenotype and relatively simple inheritance pattern, the phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) loci is frequently utilized in teaching laboratories to demonstrate genetic concepts such as Mendelian inheritance and population genetics. We have developed a next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics approach to analyze the PTC gene locus to reveal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation at nucleotide position 785 that predicts tasting ability in humans. Here students purify DNA from their own cheek cells, perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the PTC gene followed by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) testing. Students perform a second PCR on the PTC loci using high-fidelity Taq to create bar-coded amplicons for next-generation sequencing on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. Bioinformatic verification reveals polymorphic variation by aligning the entire class PTC PCR fragment sequence to the human gene using Bowtie2 and visualizing the results in the Integrated Genome Viewer. This exercise presents a learning opportunity for students to use next-generation sequencing to predict their own PTC taste sensitivity phenotype coupled with the standard CAPS method. This approach brings the PTC teaching method into the genomics era.

AB Team-based learning (TBL) is an active learning method used in many educational institutions. However, there are few examples of its use in basic medicine, such as biochemistry in medical schools. This study used TBL to teach glucose metabolism to first-year medical students. The process was in four phases: preclass preparation, readiness assurance tests, advanced questions, and a TBL test, with peer evaluation and a questionnaire. There were positive correlations between the TBL test, peer evaluation, and individual readiness test performance. Tests were taken immediately after learning and 2 weeks later, and scores decreased significantly less with TBL than traditional lectures (-2.3% vs. -17.5%). This suggests that TBL was more effective than traditional lectures in supporting knowledge retention. We used a Moodle system to facilitate communication between students and teachers, and this was evaluated positively by both groups. It was particularly useful for managing TBL. These findings suggest that TBL could be used to improve student performance in biochemistry.

AB Laboratory classes are a central element of all biochemistry and molecular biology programs. These play a role in developing students' hands-on and technical skills and also offer much more. The design of laboratory classes depends on many factors including the programs the students are enrolled in, the level they are at, employment destinations, and learning outcomes. This conference session considered the design and outcomes of laboratory experiences for undergraduate students.

AB Virtual laboratory activities are flexible approaches to engage undergraduate students in scientific practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. By utilizing online simulations, students can conduct virtual experiments on important biochemical reactions that occur during photosynthesis. The learning module described here provides students with this experience and was implemented for first-year students in a virtual summer bridge program. It introduces new biochemistry majors and nonmajors to the discipline, and it is based on an in-person photosynthesis laboratory module taught for the summer bridge program before the emergence of COVID-19. This virtual laboratory module can be readily adapted for use during the academic year in introductory biochemistry courses.

   resources for teaching
AB At the University of South Australia (UniSA), Biochemistry is a second year undergraduate course. The student cohort is diverse, with students enrolled in courses with a laboratory focus, such as Laboratory Medicine, Medical Science, Nutrition and Food Science and Pharmaceutical Science. The course is taught in a traditional manner, with weekly lectures, fortnightly tutorials and three practical sessions. In response to the growing numbers of COVID-19 cases, in mid-March the University leadership moved to cease face-to-face teaching. By this time, 58 of 96 students had completed the first two (of three) face-to-face laboratory practicals. In response to this decision, teaching of all practical based content was moved online for all students. The first question was, how do we teach practical content online? And secondly, how do we teach hands-on skills? The first question was addressed using a suite of online simulations, progressively developed since 2013. Simulations are widely used and shown to be useful as teaching aids in STEM. A total of five simulations were introduced each covering key aspects of laboratory practice, including fundamental mathematical skills, reading, and setting a pipette, basic Biochemistry assays, protein quantification, and enzyme kinetics. The second issue of teaching hands on skills was addressed once restrictions were eased. Students were invited to attend the laboratory to learn the kinesthetic skills with instructor guidance. Both approaches used proved to be highly effective and can be readily adapted not only to teaching Biochemistry, but any aspect of science education.

AB The global challenge presented by COVID-19 is unparalleled. Shortages in healthcare staff and manpower bring the practical skills of medical students under the spotlight. However, before they can be placed on hospital frontlines, it is crucial to assess their preparedness for patient interaction. This can be achieved by comparing their behavioral dynamics to those of physicians. An online questionnaire was administered between March 20, 2020 and March 27, 2020. The preventive strategies adopted by medical students and physicians at different ages and levels of education were compared by using chi-square test where apvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We report that the demonstration of preventive behaviors increased with educational attainment and age. Older age groups avoided crowded areas, wore more masks, used disinfectants and did not touch their faces as compared to the younger participants (p< 0.001). Similarly, postgraduate doctors used more masks and disinfectants as compared to graduate doctors and medical students (p< 0.001). Based on our results, the lack of preventive behavior shown by medical students has implications for policy makers. We recommend short- and long-term changes to medical programs and admissions policies to equip medical students with the personal and professional skills to better contribute to the healthcare system in the present pandemic and beyond.

AB A novel approach is described using primary literature manuscripts for the final examination of an upper level undergraduate course in virology. This innovative technique was applied as an alternative to a core comprehensive final examination. A recent primary literature paper in virology was assigned several weeks before the end of the semester. Students were instructed to procure the electronic version of the manuscript, and to thoroughly read, highlight and outline the manuscript in advance. The examination was administered with an open book format and students were encouraged to bring laptops to access information as needed to answer questions. This primary literature-based examination format is presented here as an alternative to a comprehensive final exam. By comparing student examination scores for both final examination formats over a period of 11 years, it was determined that student performance was strong and not statistically different when compared to conventional comprehensive final examinations. Thus, the examination format described here was a useful assessment tool that provided students with valuable exposure to the discipline specific primary literature. While this article describes an application to an undergraduate virology course, the same examination techniques could be successfully applied to examinations in undergraduate or graduate classes in any areas of biochemistry and molecular biology.

AB Development of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has started a new chapter for in-classroom modeling of chemical molecules. The technology provides the opportunity to design and produce various types of personalized models. However, using classical 3D printers is time consuming, and it is hard to involve students in the modeling process during traditional class times. One solution can be using hand-held 3D printers (3D pens) that allow users to instantly draw geometrical structures. Unfortunately, drawing directly in 3D is very difficult, and precise modeling of even small molecules is simply not possible. In this article, a new approach to 3D modeling is described. It is based on 3D templates that enable the drawing of molecular models directly in three dimensions. The modular nature of the templates allows for the creation of a wide variety of structures. The resulting models provide an accurate representation of molecules including correct bond angles and geometry. This approach makes 3D pens a powerful tool for the modeling of chemical structures.

AB Biochemistry has always been a mandatory topic within BS courses aimed at food science students at the University of Milan, namely: Food Science & Technology and Catering Sciences. Addressing biochemistry topics in this peculiar setting requires: (i) specific focus on topics that are seldom considered in courses offered in bio-medical curricula; (ii) close integration with other area disciplines, such as food biotechnology; (iii) ad hoc design of laboratory classes; and (iv) an array of elective courses covering specific aspects of biochemistry. In this context, for example, protein chemistry is presented by using food proteins of known structure and discussed in terms of structural features in the raw materials and of structural and chemical modifications occurring upon processing. Along the same lines, metabolic pathways and their regulation are presented starting from widespread metabolism-related issues and to issues related to food safety (including food allergies and intolerances). A similar "hands on" approach is used for laboratory classes, that cover about one third of total credits and are aimed at providing fundamental-type information by analyzing practical situations in the food chain. In spite of their inherent complexity and volume, biochemistry courses score very well with the students in mandatory anonymous surveys. Our approach to biochemistry courses seems to help the students in "visualizing" the practical implications of concepts acquired in other courses within their curricula. The students' appreciation is confirmed by the sizeable attendance to elective and specialized biochemical-themed courses.

AB Conceptual understanding and reasoning of nonscience major students enrolled in a course on biotechnology were evaluated before and after instruction. The instrument for analysis of student understanding was the Biotechnology Instrument for Knowledge Elicitation (BIKE). The BIKE targets 11 key concepts, as determined by experts in the field. A statistically significant score improvement was observed in each of the 11 concept areas after completion of the course, Biotechnology in Society (N = 117). Student responses to both the pretest and posttest were highly informative and revealed several common misconceptions that could have been overlooked in a closed form testing scenario. These alternative conceptions and recommended clarifications have been presented here. Our goal in documenting and distributing these is to better equip educators in biology and biochemistry to anticipate student preconceptions, design targeted interventions, and improve student conceptual reasoning in topics pertaining to biology and biotechnology.

ID CURRICULUM
AB The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) began an accreditation program in 2013. The criteria for accreditation of undergraduate programs include sufficient infrastructure - number and expertise of faculty, physical space and equipment, support for faculty and students - and incorporation of core concepts in the curriculum - structure and function of biomolecules; information storage; energy transfer; and quantitative skills. Students in accredited programs are able to have their degrees ASBMB certified by taking an exam focused on knowledge or skills across the four core concept areas. Members of the accreditation committees administered a survey to key stakeholders in the BMB community: undergraduate programs, both those that have applied for accreditation and those that have not; alumni/ae of accredited programs; graduate and professional programs; and employers. The goals of the study were to gauge the success of the program and determine necessary areas of improvement. The results indicate that the major benefits of applying for accreditation are the impetus to gather data and analysis not generally collected, and access to assessment data via the exam. However, stakeholders outside of the undergraduate community showed little awareness of the accreditation program. Additionally, the application process itself was seen to be very time consuming. This feedback will be used to improve the process and engage in further outreach. (c) 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(5):464-471, 2018.

AB Multiple pedagogical approaches, such as experimental experiences or computer-based activities, have been shown to increase student learning and engagement. We have developed a laboratory module that includes both a traditional live experimental component and a student-designed virtual computer simulation component. This laboratory employs the mating pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) to demonstrate four fundamental cell and molecular biology concepts: cell signaling, cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and cell cycle checkpoints. In the live laboratory, students add mating pheromone to cultures, then measure changes in cell division and morphology characteristics of the S. cerevisiae mating response. We also developed a virtual complement to this laboratory. Using the principles of Design Thinking and Agile methodology, we collaborated with an undergraduate Computer Science course to generate two computer simulations which can support the live laboratory or provide a virtual laboratory experience. We assessed how both the live and virtual laboratories contributed to learning gains in analytical skills and course content. Students who performed the simulation alone or the simulation plus live lab demonstrated learning gains, with greater gains for the live lab, but students who performed neither lab did not. Attitudinal assessment demonstrated increased student engagement and self-efficacy after performing the live and virtual labs.

ID MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
AB Disciplines such as Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, which involve concepts not included in the high-school curriculum, are very challenging for many first year university students. These subjects are particularly difficult for students accustomed to surface learning strategies involving memorization and recall of facts, as a deeper understanding of the relationship between concepts is needed for successful transfer to related areas and subsequent study. In this article, we explore an activity in a very large first year Molecular Biology course, in which students create multiple-choice questions related to targeted learning outcomes, and then answer and evaluate one another's questions. This activity encompasses elements of both self- and peer-assessment and the generative tasks of creating questions and producing written feedback may contribute to a deeper understanding of the material. We make use of a free online platform to facilitate all aspects of the process and analyze the effect of student engagement with the task on overall course performance. When compared to previous semester's cohorts, we observe a pronounced improvement in class performance on exam questions targeting similar concepts to the student-generated questions. In addition, those students that engage to a greater extent with the activity perform significantly better on the targeted exam questions than those who are less active, yet all students perform similarly on a set of isolated control questions appearing on the same exam.

AB Course-integrated Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) involve large numbers of students in real research. We describe a late-year microbiology CURE in which students use yeast to address a research question around beer brewing or synthesizing biofuel; the interdisciplinary student-designed project incorporates genetics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and microbiology. Students perceived significant learning gains around multiple technical and becoming a scientist aspects of the project. The project is demanding for both the students and the academic implementers. We examine the rich landscape of support and interaction that this CURE both encourages and requires while also considering how we can support the exercise better and more sustainably. The findings from this study provide a picture of a CURE implementation that has begun to reach the limits of both the students' and the academics' capacities to complete it.

AB Podcasts are digital files very popular in several and very distinct areas. In higher education, they have been explored in a multitude of ways mainly to support teaching and learning processes. The study here described focuses the integration of podcasts in Heredity and Evolution, a course from the Biology and Geology Degree Program at University of Minho, Portugal. It aimed to introduce podcasts in the teaching/learning context, to empirically study different dimensions of podcasting, and to evaluate students' acceptance and receptiveness to the pedagogical use of this technology. Five informative podcasts and three with feedback were produced and delivered. All the students listened to the audio files and considered the episodes audible and clear, their preference going to episodes of short or moderate length and containing summaries, study guidelines or syllabus contents. Students judged extremely valuable the integration of this technology in learning and showed receptiveness to podcasting in other courses. Curiously, in spite of owning mobile devices, students clearly favored the use of personal computers to listen to the podcasts. This student acceptance and openness to podcasting has been encouraging its pedagogical application in other teaching courses. The episodes produced often maintain the characteristics identified as the best by the students of this study but the pedagogical approach has been moving to a more student-centered learning situation, with students as podcasts producers.

AB The "Streptomyces genetics and secondary metabolism" laboratory course gives an introduction to the versatile soil dwelling Gram-positive bacteria Streptomyces and their secondary metabolism. The course combines genetic modification of Streptomyces; growing of the strain and protoplast preparation, plasmid isolation by alkaline lysis and phenol precipitation, digestions, and ligations prior to protoplast transformation, as well as investigating the secondary metabolites produced by the strains. Thus, the course is a combination of microbiology, molecular biology, and chemistry. After the course the students should understand the relationship between genes, proteins, and the produced metabolites. (C) 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB A new laboratory practical system is described which is comprised of a number of laboratory practical modules, each based around a particular technique or set of techniques, related to the theory part of the course but not designed to be dependent on it. Each module comprises an online recorded pre-lab lecture, the laboratory practical itself and a post-lab session in which students make oral presentations on different aspects of the practical. Each part of the module is assessed with the aim of providing rapid feedback to staff and students. Each laboratory practical is the responsibility of a single staff member and through this "ownership," continual review and updating is promoted. Examples of changes made by staff to modules as a result of student feedback are detailed. A survey of students who had experienced both the old-style laboratory course and the new one provided evidence of increased satisfaction with the new program. The assessment of acquired shills in the new program showed that it was much more effective than the old course.

AB In order to review the need assessment of enhancing the weightage of Applied Biochemistry in the undergraduate curriculum at Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS), Sevagram, a validated questionnaire was sent to 453 participants which include 387 undergraduate students, 11 interns, 23 postgraduate students, and 32 faculty members. A web-based data collection and analysis tool was designed for online questionnaire distribution, data collection, and analysis. Response rate was 100%. Most of the respondents agreed that the subject Biochemistry has relevance in clinical practice (81.24%) and applied based learning of Biochemistry by medical undergraduates would help in overall improvement in the health standards/patients care (83.44%). According to 65.12% respondents, most of the medical undergraduates read Biochemistry just for examination purpose only. Nearly half of the respondents agreed that minute details of biochemical reactions were not much useful in clinical practice (53.86%) and the vast majority of diagrammatic cycles memorized by the medical undergraduates had no relevance in clinical practice (51.21%), the decreased interest in learning the Applied Biochemistry was due to more amount of clinically irrelevant information taught to medical undergraduates (73.51%), there was a need to rethink for removing the diagrammatic biochemical cycles from curriculum for medical undergraduates (48.12%), the less learning of Applied Biochemistry or competencies would affect the clinical skills and knowledge of medical undergraduates (70.42%). The result of this study suggests that there is need for restructuring the Biochemistry curriculum with more clinical relevance.

AB Calls to bring interdisciplinary content and examples into introductory science courses have increased, yet strategies that involve course restructuring often suffer from the need for a significant faculty commitment to motivate change. Minimizing the need for dramatic course reorganization, the structure, reactivity, and chemical biology applications of classes of biological monomers and polymers have been integrated into introductory organic chemistry courses through three series of semester-long weekly assignments that explored (a) Carbohydrates and Oligosaccharides, (b) Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, and (c) Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids. Comparisons of unannounced pre- and post tests revealed improved understanding of a reaction introduced in the assignments, and course examinations evaluated cumulative assignment topics. Course surveys revealed that demonstrating biologically relevant applications consistently throughout the semesters enhanced student interest in the connection between basic organic chemistry content and its application to new and unfamiliar bio-related examples. Covering basic material related to these classes of molecules outside of the classroom opened lecture time to allow the instructor to further build on information developed through the weekly assignments, teaching advanced topics and applications typically not covered in an introductory organic chemistry lecture course. Assignments were implemented as homework, either with or without accompanying discussion, in both laboratory and lecture organic courses within the context of the existing course structures.

AB An inversion polymorphism of the filamin and emerin genes at the tip of the long arm of the human X-chromosome serves as the basis of an investigative laboratory in which students learn something new about their own genomes. Long, nearly identical inverted repeats flanking the filamin and emerin genes illustrate how repetitive elements can lead to alterations in genome structure (inversions) through nonallelic homologous recombination. The near identity of the inverted repeats is an example of concerted evolution through gene conversion. While the laboratory in its entirety is designed for college level genetics courses, portions of the laboratory are appropriate for courses at other levels. Because the polymorphism is on the X-chromosome, the laboratory can be used in introductory biology courses to enhance understanding of sex-linkage and to test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in females. More advanced topics, such as chromosome interference, the molecular model for recombination, and inversion heterozygosity suppression of recombination can be explored in upper-level genetics and evolution courses. DNA isolation, restriction digests, ligation, long PCR, and iPCR provide experience with techniques in molecular biology. This investigative laboratory weaves together topics stretching from molecular genetics to cytogenetics and sex-linkage, population genetics and evolutionary genetics.

AB A student response system (clickers) was introduced into a second year introductory biochemistry class to improve student engagement and performance. The class was delivered in both internal and distance education (DE) modes, with the DE students receiving recordings of the lectures (including clicker activities). However, there was concern over the use of clickers in internal classes as it may be alienating or distracting to DE students while reviewing the recordings of these lectures. In order to examine students' attitudes toward clickers, closed-and open-ended questions were examined in the student evaluations of teaching (SET). Understanding attitudes of internal and DE students is especially important as differences may exist between these groups due to the different learning environments they experience. Approximately 45% of students completed the surveys, of which 88%-91% provided written comments. Of the written comments, 18% of DE students and 22% of internal students provided unsolicited comments about clickers. Interestingly, no difference was observed in the themes identified in the comments between cohorts. The key themes included 1) clickers were beneficial for learning (and increased knowledge), 2) clickers were engaging/ fun, and 3) clickers could have been used more widely. Overall, based on this study, it was believed that clicker usage was not seen as negative activity by DE students and it was worth continuing to use clickers in teaching the large multimodal class studied here. However, there is a need to investigate the potential of new and emerging technologies to provide more interactive experiences for DE students.

AB Due to its valuable benefits and potential risks, there is a progressing debate among opponents and proponents of biotechnology in recent decades. Previous studies have shown that lack of knowledge about biotechnology remains the concern about genetically modified organisms/food (GMO/GMF). This study assessed levels of educational awareness perceptions and attitudes of United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) students towards biotechnology. An electronic survey including literacy, environmental, social, and economic domains associated with biotechnology was administered to obtain data from undergraduate students in different colleges of the university. Responses from students (n=1,104) were gathered and statistically analyzed. Results indicated that educational awareness in biotechnology literacy and environmental domains were significantly different according to the enrolled college and the academic achievement of the student. In general, a poor overall performance of our students' understanding was concluded. Aware groups most likely accepted accurate biotechnology information delivered by reliable sources from internet or lectures; they grasped their knowledge from surrounding people as a secondary source. Since UAEU students have several concept misunderstandings of biotechnology and its ethics, our results suggest that awareness plays a crucial role in forming a clear-cut opinion about this technology. Because education can shape public attitudes toward biotechnology, priorities on university curricula and teaching strategies should be extensively given, and therefore, improve in respect to this topic. Ultimately, this promotes the students' perception in understanding the new technology. (c) 2015 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 43(4):283-293, 2015.

AB Undergraduate laboratories expose students to a wide variety of topics and techniques in a limited amount of time. This can be a challenge and lead to less exposure to concepts and activities in bio-inorganic chemistry and analytical chemistry that are closely-related to biochemistry. To address this, we incorporated a new iron determination by atomic absorption spectroscopy exercise as part of a five-week long laboratory-based project on the purification of myoglobin from beef. Students were required to prepare samples for chemical analysis, operate an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, critically evaluate their iron data, and integrate these data into a study of myoglobin.

AB For successful delivery of basic science topics for health-professional students, it is critical to reduce apprehension and illustrate relevance to clinical settings and everyday life. At the beginning of the Biochemistry course for Physician Assistants, a team-based assignment was designed to develop an understanding of the mechanism of action, effectiveness, and toxicity of five common over the counter (OTC) drugs and dietary supplements, and place these familiar medicines in a political and historical context. The objectives of this exercise were to stimulate interest in biochemistry; to provide basic information on enzymes and enzyme inhibitors related to these drugs to be expanded upon later in the course; and to encourage active and interactive learning. Teams of five students were formed, and each student was given an information sheet on aspirin, alpha-galactosidase, orlistat, dextromethorphan, or simvastatin, a low dose statin, which was previously available without prescription at pharmacies in the UK. After each member of the team acquired information on one OTC drug/dietary supplement by reading an assigned information sheet, the team was asked to go through a series of questions, and then submit answers to a quiz as a group. A high rate of success on the quiz, an overwhelmingly positive response on formal course evaluations, and enthusiastic exchanges during class suggested this team-based session accomplished its goals.

AB The study of chromatin constitutes one of the most active research fields in life sciences, being subject to constant revisions that continuously redefine the state of the art in its knowledge. As every other rapidly changing field, chromatin biology requires clear and straightforward educational strategies able to efficiently translate such a vast body of knowledge to the classroom. With this aim, the present work describes a multidisciplinary computer lab designed to introduce undergraduate students to the dynamic nature of chromatin, within the context of the one semester course Chromatin: Structure, Function and Evolution. This exercise is organized in three parts including (a) molecular evolutionary biology of histone families (using the H1 family as example), (b) histone structure and variation across different animal groups, and (c) effect of histone diversity on nucleosome structure and chromatin dynamics. By using freely available bioinformatic tools that can be run on common computers, the concept of chromatin dynamics is interactively illustrated from a comparative/evolutionary perspective. At the end of this computer lab, students are able to translate the bioinformatic information into a biochemical context in which the relevance of histone primary structure on chromatin dynamics is exposed. During the last 8 years this exercise has proven to be a powerful approach for teaching chromatin structure and dynamics, allowing students a higher degree of independence during the processes of learning and self-assessment.

AB As a result of enrollment expansion, increasing numbers of students are entering into medical school in China. This combined with a shortage of teachers, means that the learning environment typically consists of a large classroom setting with traditional lecture-based learning (LBL) as the major mode to teaching and learning. In this article, we investigate the preferences for hybrid problem-based learning (hybrid-PBL) or LBL in a large classroom setting. Two hundred five second-year undergraduate students in Third Military Medical University were randomly divided to two groups. The hybrid-PBL group contained 101 students and was taught by hybrid LBL (60%) and tutor-less PBL(40%) in a large classroom. The LBL group consisted of 104 students and was taught by LBL in a large classroom too. Post-teaching performance was assessed by multiple choice questions, short-essay questions, and case-analysis questions, while the students' teaching preferences and satisfaction were assessed by questionnaires. Analysis of the results of both groups in the examination of biochemistry revealed significantly higher scores on short-essay questions and case-analysis questions in the hybrid-PBL group. Students considered hybrid-PBL to be an effective learning method and favored it over the lecture format. Furthermore, students reported positive effects of hybrid-PBL in terms of additional learning resources, critical thinking, and fun learning experiences. These results suggest that hybrid-PBL is better than the traditional LBL method at improving students' basic knowledge and problem-solving skills. Students preferred hybrid-PBL and were satisfied with it. The tutor-less PBL pattern in a large classroom setting may be feasible in Chinese medical schools.

AB This article describes a simple and robust laboratory exercise on the regulation of membrane unsaturated fatty acid composition in bacteria by a decrease in growth temperature. We take advantage of the well characterized Des pathway of Bacillus subtilis, composed of a Delta 5-desaturase (encoded by the des gene) and the canonical two-component system DesK-DesR, to study the transcriptional regulation of des during cold shock. Students analyze the expression of a reporter transcriptional fusion between the des promoter and the bacterial lacZ gene in a wild-type B. subtilis strain and in des or desK-desR mutants grown under different culture conditions. Measurements of beta-galactosidase activity allow them to investigate how the Des pathway works and to assess the role of each component of this regulatory system.

AB Recent experimental evidence indicates that the ability of adults to tolerate milk, cheese, and other lactose-containing dairy products is an autosomal dominant trait that co-evolved with dairy farming in Central Europe about 7,500 years ago. Among persons of European descent, this trait is strongly associated with a C to T substitution at a polymorphic site 13,910 bp upstream of the lactase gene. This mutation results in the persistent expression of lactase into adulthood enabling individuals carrying a T(-13,910) allele to digest lactose as adults. In this report, we describe a laboratory exercise for an undergraduate molecular biology course in which students determine their own genotype at the -13,910 polymorphic site and correlate this with their ability to tolerate dairy products. The exercise is used as a tool to teach basic molecular biology procedures such as agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR(1), and DNA sequencing. Students are actively engaged in the learning process, not only by analyzing their own DNA but also by applying their knowledge and skills to answer an authentic question. The exercise is also integrated with lecture material on the control of gene expression at the transcriptional level, in particular, how transcription factors can influence the activity of a promoter by binding to cis-acting DNA regulatory elements located within the proximal promoter of a gene or distant enhancer regions.

DE attitudes; effective learning; laboratory work; practical skills
AB This research reports on implementing the integrated laboratory work to achieve effective learning in the biochemistry course. The integrated laboratory work includes three stages: pre-laboratory, lab work, and post-laboratory. In other words, the three stages include planning, implementing, and evaluating investigation activities in the laboratory. The research design used was a posttest control group design consisting of a control and an experimental group. There were 67 students as respondents, who were divided into control (N = 33) and experimental (N = 34) groups. Practical skills were measured using an assessment rubric with the involvement of the observer. The categories of practical skills measured were procedural skills, observation skills, interpretation skills, and reporting skills. Attitude toward biochemistry was measured using a questionnaire with five Likert scales. The indicators of attitudes toward biochemistry used were liking for a biochemistry theory lesson, liking for biochemistry laboratory work, evaluative beliefs about biochemistry, and behavioral tendencies to learn biochemistry. The influence of the implementation of the integrated laboratory work on the students' practical skills and attitudes toward biochemistry was analyzed using MANOVA. The research result shows that implementing the integrated laboratory work improves students' average scores in practical skills and attitudes toward biochemistry. All the practical skills and attitudes categories in the experimental group have a higher score than those in the control group. The reason is that the work of the integrated laboratory can prepare students to conduct better investigations in biochemistry laboratory work.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic forced many courses to move online, presenting a particular challenge for hands-on laboratory courses. One such course in our Biotechnology track is an advanced Protein Interactions lecture/laboratory course. This 8-week course typically meets for 5 h a week in the laboratory space. For the Fall 2020 version of the course, first-person videos were produced for each of the laboratory experiments, and the corresponding experimental data produced by students in previous semesters were provided for the current students to analyze in their electronic lab notebooks and lab reports. Student perspectives and assessments were collected on course participants from Fall 2019 (in-person laboratories) and Fall 2020 (online laboratories) to compare experiences and outcomes. Analysis of the data shows that the online students appreciated the videos and gained self-confidence in the procedures, but maintained more misconceptions about the material. In addition to being unable to perform the hands-on experiments, other factors such as anxiety could also be interfering with the learning process under the pandemic conditions. The implementation process for the remote labs, student reactions, and lessons learned are discussed.

AB Here, we describe a free, web-based simulation of the lac operon, "LacOp," that is designed to enhance the learning of prokaryotic gene regulation and pathways in advanced high school and undergraduate genetics courses. This new electronic resource was created by a team of students in an advanced undergraduate course and is hosted online (). LacOp has a simple web interface compatible with a range of devices, including smartphones. To determine whether the LacOp simulation enhances student learning from traditional instruction, we introduced the lac operon to undergraduate genetics students through a traditional classroom experience followed by use of the LacOp simulation. Students worked on their own using the included tutorial to create and test the effect of various genotypes on E. coli lactose metabolism and regulation. Upon completion of the tutorial, students showed measurable gains in conceptual understanding of the lac operon. These students also reported a generally favorable opinion of the LacOP simulation as a use of their instructional time.

AB In an upper-division interdisciplinary laboratory experiment, students use Raman spectroscopy to highlight how the overall structure and conformational order of lipid bilayers can be influenced by their individual phospholipid composition. Students prepare a supported lipid bilayer, as a model cell membrane, by spreading liposomes made of various phospholipids on a solid support. The characterization of phospholipid bilayers, a major component of cellular membranes, can advance our fundamental understanding of important biological phenomena, with significant implications in various fields including drug delivery and development. We use Raman spectroscopy as an analytical tool to investigate the structural and packing properties of model cell membranes. The spectral frequency, intensity, and line-width of lipid Raman bands are extremely sensitive to structural alterations. This experimental module effectively exposes students to the fundamentals of Raman spectroscopy and teaches students the importance of interdisciplinary education as they integrate concepts from chemical structure, molecular interactions, and analytical spectroscopic techniques to gain a more holistic understanding of biological membrane properties.

AB The flipped classroom has gained prominence in higher education, but little has been written about its application in the Middle East. This study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of flipping biochemistry classes in comparison to the traditional didactic program. The study was conducted on first-year medical students taking biochemistry at a private University in Saudi Arabia. A series of short, pre-recorded videos were used to replace traditional lectures. The scheduled lecture time was used for problem solving and discussion sessions. To gather their evaluation of the learning approach, participants completed an online survey. To study the effect of the learning approach on exam performance, the scores of the participants were compared in questions taught using the flipped classroom versus the traditional didactic method. Participants noted that the effort needed for the course was similar regardless of the learning approach. Moreover, examination performance measured using single best answer multiple-choice questions showed no difference between the two teaching methods. However, the participants did report a significantly better perception of the flipped classroom compared to the traditional approach. Although no significant improvement in examination results was noted, the participants significantly favored the flipped classroom over traditional lectures. This study has demonstrated that the flipped classroom can be used in the teaching of the biosciences within a Middle Eastern setting, resulting in an improvement in student satisfaction and engagement in the course materials.

AB Drought is a major environmental stress factor that affects the growth and development of plants. All plants have to maintain the reactive oxygen species within certain levels for normal cellular homeostasis by means of their antioxidant systems, which can be classified as enzymatic and non-enzymatic. Plants under drought stress generate an excess production of reactive oxygen species. At high concentrations, this can be detrimental by producing damage to the protein structures and inhibiting enzymes, as well as oxidizing macromolecules, which may eventually lead to cell death. There has been increasing attention paid to the antioxidant capacity of aromatic/medicinal plants, with a high antioxidant content having been reported in some plant extracts, such as in Mentha piperita (peppermint). Peppermint plants cultivated under drought stress also present high levels of phenolic compounds, peroxidase enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation of membranes. A simple and inexpensive laboratory class is proposed for teaching some mechanisms that plants have evolved to avoid reactive oxygen species damage. The series of lab experiments described is aimed at demonstrating the antioxidant status in aromatic plants subjected to drought stress, by measuring total phenolic compound content (non-enzymatic antioxidant compound), peroxidase activity (enzymatic antioxidant) and malondialdehyde, as convenient biomarkers for lipid peroxidation. The proposed class will be carried out by undergraduate students of the advanced biochemistry course, as part of our biology and agronomy studies. The experiment presented is intended to be used as a vehicle to emphasize the concepts that students have learned in their lectures. This lab exercise to be carried out by the students has dual goals: to apply a methodology only learned superficially on previous courses, and also to increase their understanding of how plants developed resistance mechanisms in order to tolerate drought stress.

AB Examinations present an intensely focused opportunity for student learning yet opportunities for collaboration, communication, and feedbacks are often wasted. Two-stage examinations where students first take examinations individually and then repeat the examination in small groups hold promise to address this issue. Here, we pilot and evaluate a two-stage examination within an advanced undergraduate biomedical sciences course. We evaluated this innovation by triangulation of data from a questionnaire, semi-structured student interviews, as well as, comparison of student grades between stages of examination across higher- and lower-performing student groups. Quantitative data from the structured questionnaire showed that a majority of students perceived the collaborative stage of two-stage examinations successful in promoting peer collaboration and communication. Furthermore, there was deepened conceptual understanding and provision of immediate feedback. The two-stage examination did not, however, ameliorate students' test anxiety. Qualitative data from semi-structured student interviews were consistent with quantitative data to show that a two-stage examination provides positive impact particularly on immediate feedback, peer collaboration and communication but contributed to sustained test anxiety possibly due to negative experiences during group interactions. Both lower- and higher-performing students showed improvement in the collaborative stage as compared to the preceding individual stage of two-stage examination. This would suggest possible benefits of two-stage examination for learning for all student abilities. This study discusses the advantages and pitfalls of two-stage examinations for biomedical sciences and will guide informed recommendations for subsequent implementation elsewhere.

AB DNA barcoding is an important molecular methodology for species identification that was developed over the last two decades and it should be covered in the biology bachelor curriculum. Here, we present an example of DNA barcoding by sequencing a segment of the 28S nuclear ribosomal large subunit rRNA gene of wild mushrooms and framing the education in a project form for undergraduate students in biology. Students perform this project in 6-8 weeks, which also includes preparing a poster, writing a report and presenting a paper related to the work in a journal club format. First, fieldwork in the Netherlands was carried out, during which students collected mushrooms under supervision of a professional mycologist with the goal to (a) verify morphologically based identifications with a molecular method and (b) assess phylogenetic relationships of the different species collected. Next, DNA extractions and quantitation were performed, PCR amplification was done, and samples were sent out for Sanger sequencing. Students aligned and analyzed the sequences using BLAST and Geneious and subsequently created a phylogenetic tree. In case of collecting DNA barcodes of an earlier sequenced species, students could upload the data to a repository established for facilitation of future research projects. The method described is very robust, reagents and equipment are readily available, and costs are relatively low. In addition, the results can be compared to published fungal phylogenetic trees.

AB Undergraduate research (UR) refers to a series of scientific research activities for undergraduates. For the past few years in China, medical colleges and universities have increasingly attached importance on UR, aiming to provide undergraduates with better scientific research conditions, improve their understanding about scientific research and their basic scientific skills. Chinese medical undergraduates participate in scientific research spontaneously. However, the specific effects of UR are still unclear. In China, few quantitative standards to evaluate the detailed roles and effects of medical undergraduates' UR are available yet. To explore how UR influences Chinese medical undergraduates' scientific research abilities and their individual development, we conduct a cross-sectional analytical study by anonymous self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaires access the scientific research capabilities and qualities of students. The results show that students who participate in UR are equipped with better self-evaluation of designing research projects, using statistical software, making figures and charts, evaluating experimental results and performing experiments than those who do not; and the students who persist in UR have the highest self-evaluation on the abilities mentioned above. Hence, through quantitative criteria, it can be concluded that UR can help Chinese medical undergraduates build interest in scientific research, develop scientific thinking and basic research capacities, and set a solid foundation for future research.

AB Here, we developed an integrated course based on two dimensional-electrophoresis and spectrometry mass (2DE-MS) technique for undergraduate students to help them learn proteomic techniques. The soluble proteins in wild type and gene knockout bacteria were separated by 2DE and the differently expressed proteins were identified by MS analysis. The proteomic data was finally confirmed by RT-PCR detection. The separated experiments of 2DE, MS, RNA isolation, RT-PCR, as well as essential bioinformatic analysis, were integrated into a one-week course, which provided students an opportunity to systematically understand the proteomic techniques and their applications in current scientific research.

AB Learner-centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical application of basic science concepts through active learning and problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always apparent to health-profession students, effective teaching of medical biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for long-term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by solving clinical cases, answering case-based questions, and creating concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive. They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance especially for answering the comprehension-based questions correctly in the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for other health-professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate students.

AB This article is a guided pedagogical approach, devoted to postgraduate students specializing in biochemistry, aimed at presenting all single reactions and overall equations leading to the metabolic interaction between ureagenesis and citric acid cycle to be incorporated into a two-three lecture series about the interaction of urea cycle with other metabolic pathways. We emphasize that citrate synthetase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, three enzymes of the citric acid cycle are not involved, thus creating a shunt in citric acid cycle. In contrast, the glutamic-oxaloacetate transaminase, which does not belong to citric acid cycle, has a paramount importance in the metabolic interaction of the two cycles, because it generates aspartate, one of the two fuel molecules of urea cycle, and a-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Finally, students should appreciate that balancing equations for all atoms and charges is not only a stoichiometric task, but strongly facilitates the discussion of the physiological roles of metabolic pathways. Indeed, this exercise has been used in the classroom, to encourage a deeper level of understanding of an important biochemical issue.

AB Responsible conduct in learning and research (RCLR) was progressively introduced into the pharmacology curriculum for undergraduate science students at The University of Western Australia. In the second year of this undergraduate curriculum, a lecture introduces students to issues such as the use of animals in teaching and responsible conduct of research. Third year student groups deliver presentations on topics including scientific integrity and the use of human subjects in research. Academic and research staff attending these presentations provide feedback and participate in discussions. Students enrolled in an optional capstone Honours year complete an online course on the responsible conduct of research and participate in an interactive movie. Once RCLR became established in the curriculum, a survey of Likert-scaled and open-ended questions examined student and staff perceptions. Data were expressed as Approval (% of responses represented by Strongly Agree and Agree). RCLR was found to be relevant to the study of pharmacology (69-100% Approval), important for one's future career (62-100% Approval), and stimulated further interest in this area (32-75% Approval). Free entry comments demonstrated the value of RCLR and constructive suggestions for improvement have now been incorporated. RCLR modules were found to be a valuable addition to the pharmacology undergraduate curriculum. This approach may be used to incorporate ethics into any science undergraduate curriculum, with the use of discipline-specific topics.

AB CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology is used in the manipulation of genome sequences and gene expression. Because of the ease and rapidity with which genes can be mutated using CRISPR/Cas9, we sought to determine if a single-semester undergraduate class could be successfully taught, wherein students isolate mutants for specific genes using CRISPR/Cas9. Six students were each assigned a single Drosophila gene, for which no mutants currently exist. Each student designed and created plasmids to encode single guide RNAs that target their selected gene; injected the plasmids into Cas9-expressing embryos, in order to delete the selected gene; carried out a three-generation cross to test for germline transmission of a mutated allele and generate a stable stock of the mutant; and characterized the mutant alleles by PCR and sequencing. Three genes out of six were successfully mutated. Pre-and post-survey evaluations of the students in the class revealed that student attitudes towards their research competencies increased, although the changes were not statistically significant. We conclude that it is feasible to develop a laboratory genome editing class, to provide effective laboratory training to undergraduate students, and to generate mutant lines for use by the broader scientific community.

AB The article describes the development of a new approach to teach molecular biology to undergraduate biology students. The 34 students who participated in this research belonged to the first period of the Biological Sciences teaching course of the Instituto Federal Goiano at Urutai Campus, Brazil. They were registered in Cell Biology in the first semester of 2013. They received four 55 min-long expository/dialogued lectures that covered the content of "structure and functions of nucleic acids". Later the students were invited to attend four meetings (in a computer laboratory) in which some concepts of Bioinformatics were presented and some problems of the Rosalind platform were solved. The observations we report here are very useful as a broad groundwork to development new research. An interesting possibility is research into the effects of bio-informatics interventions that improve molecular biology learning.

AB The critical need for enhancing influenza pandemic preparedness in many developing nations has led the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to develop an international influenza vaccine capacity-building program. Among the critical limitations faced by many of these nations is lack of access to training programs for staff supporting operations within vaccine production facilities. With support from BARDA, the Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) at North Carolina State University has addressed this need for training by developing and delivering a comprehensive training program, consisting of three courses: Fundamentals of cGMP Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing, Advanced Upstream Processes for Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing, and Advanced Downstream Processes for Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing. The courses cover process design, transfer, and execution at manufacturing scale, quality systems, and regulations covering both manufacturing and approval of pandemic vaccines. The Fundamentals course focuses on the concepts, equipment, applicable regulations, and procedures commonly used to produce influenza vaccine. The two Advanced courses focus on process design, scale up, validation, and new technologies likely to improve efficiency of vaccine production. All three courses rely on a combination of classroom instruction and hands-on training in BTEC's various laboratories. Each course stands alone, and participants may take one or more of the three courses. Overall participant satisfaction with the courses has been high, and follow-up surveys show that participants actively transferred the knowledge they gained to the workplace. Future plans call for BTEC to continue offering the three courses and to create an online version of several modules of the Fundamentals course.

AB In the current laboratory assignment, technical aspects of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are integrated in the context of six different bacterial outbreak scenarios. The Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Sequence (ERIC) PCR was used to analyze different outbreak scenarios. First, groups of 24 students determined optimal ERIC-PCR conditions to validate the protocol and subsequently applied ERIC-PCR to identify genetic relatedness among bacterial strains. Based on these genetic fingerprints, students selected the outbreak cases from the patient samples and assessed the risk factors for the outbreak scenario. Finally, students presented their findings during a classroom presentation. The results indicated that the assignment successfully facilitated student learning on the technical aspects of (ERIC) PCR and clearly demonstrated the practical application of PCR in a clinical diagnostic setting. Additionally, the assignment was highly appreciated by the students.

AB An exercise using simple paper strips to illustrate protein helical and sheet secondary structures is presented. Drawing on the rich historical context of the use of physical models in protein biochemistry by early practitioners, in particular Linus Pauling, the purpose of this activity is to cultivate in students a hands-on, intuitive sense of protein secondary structure and to complement the common computer-based structural portrayals often used in teaching biochemistry. As students fold these paper strips into model secondary structures, they will better grasp how intramolecular hydrogen bonds form in the folding of a polypeptide into secondary structure, and how these hydrogen bonds direct the overall shape of helical and sheet structures, including the handedness of the alpha-helix and the difference between right- and the left-handed twist.

AB Gel electrophoresis DNA fingerprints offer a graphical and visually appealing illumination of the similarities and differences between DNA sequences of different species and individuals. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction digest protocol was designed to give high-school students the opportunity to generate simple fingerprints of plants thereby illustrating concepts and techniques in genetics and molecular biology. Three combinations of primers/restriction enzyme targeting chloroplast DNA were sufficient to generate patterns that enabled visual discrimination of plant species. The protocol was tested with a range of common fruit, vegetable, and herb plants that could be easily cultivated and handled in the laboratory. Toxic or hazardous materials such as ethidium bromide and liquid nitrogen were avoided. The protocol was validated as a university outreach workshop targeted at a group of up to 10 high-school students. In a teaching laboratory, students sampled plants, setup the PCR reaction and restriction digest using microliter pipettes, and loaded the digested samples on an agarose gel. The workshop was structured as 2 x 2.5-hour sessions on separate days. The main challenges stemmed from the speed and accuracy of pipetting, especially at the gel loading stage. Feedback from students was largely positive, with the majority reporting that they had both enjoyed and learnt from the experience.

AB Presently, a variety of policies and measures has implemented to enhance the scientific research and innovation ability of medical students, but in the process of practice, there are many problems, such as they lack of independent topic selection ability, weak scientific research skills, lack of autonomous learning ability, the research results are simple and ineffective, limited teacher guidance time and so on. This paper attempted to build an effective model for the promotion of medical students' scientific research and innovation ability, in order to establish an efficacy evaluation model of the "Medical students' Innovative Scientific Research Program." Undergraduates, graduate assistants, and tutors were interviewed with the Behavioral Event Interview technique, and a questionnaire of efficacy evaluation characteristics concluded from the interviews was formed. The questionnaire was conducted on medical students in the Medical students' Innovative Scientific Research Program, and the constructed model was analyzed using reliability analysis, validity analysis, and variation analysis. At the same time, the experimental teaching models are summarized and combed, and compared with other methods such as independent sample test. The results show the model could effectively evaluate the efficacy of the Medical students' Innovative Scientific Research Program and its teaching model is effective in cultivating medical students' learning and scientific research ability. It can provide theoretical support and practical reference for the evaluation and reform of the teaching modes related to the cultivation of scientific and innovative ability of medical students.

AB Most textbooks and lecturers present Michaelis-Menten kinetics using the equation v = V-max[S]/(K-m + [S]). There are advantages to presenting this relationship in a slightly different form, namely v = V-max/{1 + (K-m/[S])}. We articulate advantages for single-substrate reactions and extend the formalism to include the three classes of bi-substrate reactions.

AB An in-depth analysis of today's online biochemistry learning is required to ensure better learning in the future. As a skill that students need to enter the world of work, critical thinking remains a goal in higher education. To develop critical thinking, students need to self-regulate by developing their self-regulated learning (SRL). This study aims to analyze students' critical thinking and SRL during online biochemistry learning. The research sample comprises 54 University of Mataram students. The data on critical thinking and SRL were gathered using tests and questionnaires. Supporting data were collected from observations on the Moodle platform, which was used as a learning tool during the learning process, and free-response data. The results revealed low average scores for three components of the students' critical thinking in online biochemistry learning, namely hypothesis testing, developing conclusions and argument analysis. Among the indicators, metacognitive skill had the highest average score and help seeking had the lowest average score in the SRL measurement. Students' low critical thinking in online biochemistry learning may be caused by a lack of student-student interaction.

AB Undergraduate laboratory courses are essential to teaching core principles in STEM. This course, Quantitative Biological Methods, provides a unique approach to teaching molecular biology research techniques to students, in a laboratory that is delivered in a sequence that parallels standard biomedical research laboratory protocols. Students attend a lecture where they are taught the essential principles of biomedical research, and a lab where they learn to use laboratory equipment, perform experiments, and purify and quantify DNA and proteins. The course begins with an introduction to laboratory safety, pipetting, centrifugation, spectrophotometry, and other basic laboratory techniques. Next, the lab focuses on the purification and analysis of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) from an Escherichia coli lysate. Students study this GST-GFP fusion protein and perform protein quantification, enzyme assays, chromatography, fluorescent detection, normalization, SDS-PAGE, and western blotting. Students then learn recombinant DNA technology using the GST-GFP vector that was the source of the fusion protein in the prior labs, and perform ligation, transformation of E. coli cells, blue/white screening, DNA purification via a miniprep, PCR, DNA quantification, restriction enzyme digestion, and agarose gel electrophoresis. Students write laboratory reports to demonstrate an understanding of the principles of the laboratory methods, and they must present and critically analyze their data. The lab methods described herein aim to emphasize the core molecular biology principles and techniques, prepare students for work in a biomedical research laboratory, and introduce students to both GST and GFP, two versatile laboratory proteins.

AB While we have been looking for alternative educational materials for our undergraduate students, we found ourself in Covid-19 pandemic and had to think postgraduate education. On the first day of restrictions, our major problem was to learn and find the best communication tool. The first experiences for online meetings were boring, we were not feeling our emotions but as days past we got used to it. We all understand the importance of having alternatives and have to be ready for second choices. During those challenging days, all had more time to work on our completed data, time to write, complete the proofreading of written materials. Other vital scientific activities for career development and profile building such as reading (every meeting with new articles/reviews), publishing and preparing oral presentation were fully completed during the online meetings as a part of lab meeting activities. They learned to improve communication skills, be active participants, and fight.

TI Incorporation of classical scientific research stories into traditional

AB Biochemistry is an important curriculum for all medical students but has long been considered obscure and of very little or indirect relevance to medical or clinical practice, which markedly diminishes the enthusiasm and motivation of medical students in learning. Biochemistry teachers always face a tremendous challenge to deliver an attractive and high-quality lecture class. Inspired by convincing studies that show numerous benefits of undergraduate research, we tried to modify our teaching method in the past 5 years by incorporating classical scientific research stories into our traditional lecture class, such as the discovery of the semi-conservative DNA replication, telomeric DNA and telomerase, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and so on. Through this story-based teaching, we not only helped them deeply understand the textbook content, but also introduced the process of real scientific research to the students in an interesting way. Our efforts aim to combine the delivery of knowledge with the inspiration of students' active learning. We found that most students involved in our classes responded positively. As described in the survey, they were strongly attracted by those research stories; rather than feeling bored about the Biochemistry textbook, they experienced curiosity which fostered their active learning. They also learned to appreciate the beauty of science. More importantly, their impression on how the authentic science research was done was instructive for their critical thinking.

DE active learning; concept maps; metabolism learning
AB Learning metabolic pathways is vital for understanding biochemical processes and all of their implications for life. Their learning in the virtual environment is complex and generative learning strategies, such as the construction of online conceptual maps, can help in this process. This article presents a proposal for the collaborative construction of virtual concept maps on metabolism by students in the CMap Cloud browser application (free). A sequence of steps is suggested, which include online group brainstorming and discussions, peer assessment, and teachers feedback. This proposal is flexible and can be adapted to the didactic and technological reality of each teacher.

AB Our climate is changing due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases from the production and use of fossil fuels. Present atmospheric levels of CO(2)were last seen 3 million years ago, when planetary temperature sustained high Arctic camels. As scientists and educators, we should feel a professional responsibility to discuss major scientific issues like climate change, and its profound consequences for humanity, with students who look up to us for knowledge and leadership, and who will be most affected in the future. We offer simple to complex backgrounds and examples to enable and encourage biochemistry educators to routinely incorporate this most important topic into their classrooms.

AB Course specific learning outcomes are an important tool to define the scope of a course and can be very helpful when designing experiments and assessments. With slight modification, these learning outcomes can serve as a guide when transitioning to the distance learning format especially in courses with a traditional lab. Here we present such an example for the biophysical chemistry course.

AB The Hill equation, which models the cooperative ligand-receptor binding equilibrium, turns out to be useful in modeling the progression of infectious disease outbreaks such as CoViD-19. The equation fits well the data for total and daily case numbers, allows tentative predictions for the half-point and end point of the epidemic, and presents a mathematical characterization of how social interventions "flatten the curve" of the disease progression.

AB Lab courses are a significant component of biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) education. In teaching the labs, we combine established techniques with novel approaches. Lab formats have also moved from traditional cookbook style labs to guided inquiry to course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), where faculty bring their own research interests into the course setting with a larger number of students in a much more restricted time frame. This presentation is designed to explore some of these ideas and challenge the reader to introduce research opportunities to all students, not just the smaller group of students in their research labs.

AB The correct labeling of seafood is important to protect nature and the rights of consumers. Given the certainty that the resources of the sea are not inexhaustible, only strict regulations and the implementation of sustainable fishing systems and reliable and traceable marketing systems can help ensure the long-term sustainability of fishery resources. Detecting mislabeling and seafood fraud is a useful resource for improving students' motivation and developing active learning methodologies in higher education. In the present study, we have proposed to the students a lab exercise consisting of exploring 25 different commercial cephalopod products from three major European supermarkets by using DNA barcoding and analyzing the results under the framework of EU and Spanish regulations. The problem is connected with the last theme (traceability) of the Conservation Genetics and Breeding course with the aim of providing students with a practical research lab experience about a real problem before going deeper into more theoretical contents. In this way, they can use the knowledge and the skills they acquired previously to better comprehend and think critically about the problem. Findings from students' answers to a survey revealed that the use of this approach generates useful information for communities, increases curiosity and feelings of benefit, and leads to high levels of satisfaction with lab practices compared with those in other courses. In conclusion, lab exercises focused on seafood control, in addition to being viable, can be used as a tool in classes to improve students' commitment to higher education.

AB Currently, traditional paper methods may not effectively be used in education due to lack of access, outdated content, and poor graphics. Education through mobile-based applications is one of the alternative solutions. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate LabSafety educational application and its effect on promoting the knowledge of pharmacy students. In this interventional study, the LabSafety application was first developed and evaluated for educating students about the safety measures in laboratories. Then, all pharmacy students from Kerman University of Medical Sciences (n = 316) were selected and randomly enrolled into one of three groups using simple random sampling: control (n = 106), traditional (n = 105), and application (n = 105) groups. To assess students' knowledge before and after the intervention, two valid and reliable (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.94 and 0.93, respectively) questionnaires were used. The results of the study showed no significant differences among the mean scores of the participants' knowledge before intervention (p = 0.82). After the intervention, the mean scores of the application group were 5.52 higher than the scores of the traditional group and 7.3 higher than the scores of the control group (p < 0.0001). Age had no significant effect on the posttest scores of the participants (p = 0.52). As a result, the use of this educational application can effectively increase the knowledge of all age groups of pharmacy students regarding safety measures in pharmaceutical laboratories. The mobile-based applications with online and offline access, interactive features, and user-friendly interfaces are more engaging and they can be used complementary to traditional training methods.

AB The enzymatic determination of glucose in soft drinks, based on the glucose concentration measurement by means of the coupled reactions of glucose oxidase and peroxidase, has been implemented at the University of Malaga and optimized according to the Biochemistry and Chemistry undergraduate students' results and feedback throughout the last few years. This traditional and robust laboratory practical has been reformed, in the light of inquiry-based and interdisciplinary learning approaches, in order to optimize the students' formative achievements that now are not restricted to the learning of enzymology, but also integrates cross-curricular knowledge from chemistry and mathematics. In this experiment, inexpensive and feasible to be carried out in a single laboratory session, students have to make the decision of what method is the most suitable for a given analytical problem, anticipating situations that they will probably face throughout their professional careers. It not only illustrates basic issues related to the use of enzymes as reagents for enzymatic analyses and its application to food chemistry, but it is also used to put into practice some principles of statistical analysis and analytical methods evaluation. This can be achieved because students get results from two different enzymatic analysis protocols (kinetic and end-point methods) using a single reaction mixture. The measurement of glucose concentration in four carbonated soft-drinks, regular or sugar-free colas and tonic waters makes students deal with the presence of color interferences that should be either avoided or eliminated. Undergraduate students, having performed this experiment, have found it formative, interesting, and challenging.

Nowadays, educational process is forced to face the quickly growing overflow of easily accessible data and properly guide the students not to be lead astray in the information chaos. Hence, in view of the foregoing, it appears obvious that modern medical education should put particular stress on selective acquiring, interpreting, and applying integrated multidisciplinary knowledge rather than on just absorbing and memorizing huge amount of scattered information. The presented case study aims at familiarizing the students with basic molecular biology techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Importantly, it is not limited only to discussing and learning the principles of the assays mentioned earlier, but it also shows their practical application in a particular diagnostic process and give the guidelines on how to explain and interpret exemplary results. In parallel, the way the case study is constructed allows a tutor to lead students into discussion on clinical aspects related to HIV infection what should eventually create complete picture of a HIV diagnostic process, thereby integrating basic knowledge of molecular biology laboratory techniques, HIV biology, and immunological response.

AB Undergraduates learn that gene editing in diverse organisms is now possible. How targeted manipulation of genes and genomes is utilized in basic science and biomedicine to address biological questions is challenging for undergraduates to conceptualize. Thus, we developed a lab experience that would allow students to be actively engaged in the full process of design, implementation of a gene editing strategy, and interpretation of results within an 8-week lab period of a Genetics course. The laboratory experience combines two transformative biotechnology tools; the utilization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a diagnostic marker of gene expression and the fundamentals and specificity of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-cas9 (CRISPR-cas9) gene editing in bacterial cells. The students designed and constructed plasmids that express single guide RNA targeted to GFP, expressed the sgRNA and cas9 in bacteria cells, and successfully deactivated GFP gene expression in the bacterial cells with their designed CRISPR-cas9 tools. Student assessment revealed most students achieved student learning objectives. We conclude this lab experience is an effective and accessible method for engaging students in the scientific practices, knowledge and challenges revolving targeted CRISPR-cas9 gene manipulation.

AB Determination of thermostability of enzymes is of prime importance for their successful industrial applications and, yet, the published data has often been incompletely analyzed to assess the suitability of enzymes. It is possible to determine meaningful thermostability parameters from the routinely acquired data through a straightforward method that is not only more informative but also provides a means to compare thermostability of enzymes from different sources. Here, we describe a simple, effective, and economical way to determine enzyme thermostability. In our opinion, including this method in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology curricula will encourage students to include thermostability analysis in their future work, leading to a more meaningful approach to evaluate and compare enzymes. Furthermore, as the method requires minimum specialized equipment, the analysis will be particularly suitable for labs that cannot afford expensive setup.

AB Here, we present a 13-week research-based biochemistry laboratory curriculum designed to provide the students with the experience of engaging in original research while introducing foundational biochemistry laboratory techniques. The laboratory experience has been developed around the directed evolution of an enzyme chosen by the instructor, with mutations designed by the students. Ideal enzymes for this curriculum are able to be structurally modeled, solubly expressed, and monitored for activity by UV/Vis spectroscopy, and an example curriculum for haloalkane dehalogenase is given. Unique to this curriculum is a successful implementation of saturation mutagenesis and high-throughput screening of enzyme function, along with bioinformatics analysis, homology modeling, structural analysis, protein expression and purification, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and enzyme kinetics. Each of these techniques is carried out using a novel student-designed mutant library or enzyme variant unique to the lab team and, importantly, not described previously in the literature. Use of a well-established set of protocols promotes student data quality. Publication may result from the original student-generated hypotheses and data, either from the class as a whole or individual students that continue their independent projects upon course completion.

AB To promote graduate students' active learning, deep reading of high quality papers was done by graduate students enrolled in biochemistry and microbiology pharmacy curriculum offered by college of life science, Jiangxi Normal University from 2013 to 2015. The number of graduate students, who participated in the course in 2013, 2014, and 2015 were eleven, thirteen and fifteen, respectively. Through deep reading of papers, presentation, and group discussion in the lecture, these graduate students have improved their academic performances effectively, such as literature search, PPT document production, presentation management, specialty document reading, academic inquiry, and analytical and comprehensive ability. The graduate students also have increased their understanding level of frontier research, scientific research methods, and experimental methods.

TI Molecular dynamics characterization of the conformational landscape of

AB Molecular modelling and simulations are nowadays an integral part of research in areas ranging from physics to chemistry to structural biology, as well as pharmaceutical drug design. This popularity is due to the development of high-performance hardware and of accurate and efficient molecular mechanics algorithms by the scientific community. These improvements are also benefitting scientific education. Molecular simulations, their underlying theory, and their applications are particularly difficult to grasp for undergraduate students. Having hands-on experience with the methods contributes to a better understanding and solidification of the concepts taught during the lectures. To this end, we have created a computer practical class, which has been running for the past five years, composed of several sessions where students characterize the conformational landscape of small peptides using molecular dynamics simulations in order to gain insights on their binding to protein receptors. In this report, we detail the ingredients and recipe necessary to establish and carry out this practical, as well as some of the questions posed to the students and their expected results. Further, we cite some examples of the students' written reports, provide statistics, and share their feedbacks on the structure and execution of the sessions. These sessions were implemented alongside a theoretical molecular modelling course but have also been used successfully as a standalone tutorial during specialized workshops. The availability of the material on our web page also facilitates this integration and dissemination and lends strength to the thesis of open-source science and education.

AB To foster medical students to become physicians who will be lifelong independent learners and critical thinkers with healthy skepticism and provide high-quality patient care guided by the best evidence, teaching of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become an important component of medical education. Currently, the teaching and learning of biochemistry in medical schools incorporates its medical relevance and applications. However, to our knowledge there have been no reports on integrating EBM with teaching and learning medical biochemistry. Here, we present a case study to illustrate the significance of this approach. This case study was based on a biochemistry/nutrition question in a popular board review book about whether a homeless alcoholic man is at risk of developing a deficiency of vitamin E. The possible answers and explanation provided in the book raised a question about the correct answer, which provided us with an opportunity to adapt the philosophy and certain basic EBM principles to find evidence for the clinical applicability of a commonly taught biochemistry topic. The outcome of this case study not only taught us how to conduct an EBM exercise to answer a specific patient question, but also provided us with an opportunity for in-depth teaching and learning of the medical relevance of a specific biochemistry topic based on the best clinical evidence obtained from a systematic research of medical literature.

AB Teaching the subject of the electron transport chain is one of the most challenging aspects of the chemistry curriculum at the high school level. This article presents an educational program called Electron Transport Chain which consists of 14 visual animations including a biochemistry quiz. The program was created in the Adobe Flash CS3 Professional animation program and is designed for high school chemistry students. Our goal is to develop educational materials that facilitate the comprehension of this complex subject through dynamic animations which show the course of the electron transport chain and simultaneously explain its nature. We record the process of the electron transport chain, including connections with oxidative phosphorylation, in such a way as to minimize the occurrence of discrepancies in interpretation. The educational program was evaluated in high schools through the administration of a questionnaire, which contained 12 opened-ended items and which required participants to evaluate the graphics of the animations, chemical content, student preferences, and its suitability for high school biochemistry teaching.

AB Understanding of proteins and other biological macromolecules must be based on an appreciation of their 3-dimensional shape and the fine details of their structure. Conveying these details in a clear and stimulating fashion can present challenges using conventional approaches and 2-dimensional monitors and projectors. Here we describe a method for the production of 3-D interactive images of protein structures that can be manipulated in real time through the use of augmented reality software. Users first see a real-time image of themselves using the computer's camera, then, when they hold up a trigger image, a model of a molecule appears automatically in the video. This model rotates and translates in space in response to movements of the trigger card. The system described has been optimized to allow customization for the display of user-selected structures to create engaging, educational visualizations to explore 3-D structures.

ID MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Intermediary metabolism can be a complex area to study due to the inherent modularity of the catabolic biochemical processes. This article outlines a novel, cost-effective, and universally applicable teaching activity to enhance students understanding of the inter-relationship between the key processes of intermediary metabolism. A simple origami model, the Biochemist-Tree has been developed as a learning activity for intermediary metabolism, and its implementation was assessed. This modular origami model involves folding individual layers of the model, which must then be constructed into a tree with the metabolic process flowing correctly from macromolecules to ATP production from the electron transport chain/oxidative phosphorylation. Forty-eight students were provided with the activity as a revision tutorial exercise toward the end of a module on the introduction to biochemistry. The findings from this study show that the students found the activity to be interesting (>75%), scientifically useful (95%), and would recommend other students (85%) using this for their revision of catabolic metabolism. The novel nature of the exercise meant that it was engaging for the students and one that they also felt improved the understanding of the integration of the metabolic processes included. Further to being a one-off test of student understanding, the inclusion of key molecular structures and pathway steps helps to further embed these as a reference sources for revision.

AB Candida spp. includes more than 160 species but only 20 species pose clinical problems. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis account for more than 75% of all the fungemias worldwide. In 1995 and 2005, one C. albicans and two C. parapsilosis-related species were described, respectively. Using phenotypic traits, the identification of these newly described species is inconclusive or impossible. Thus, molecular-based procedures are mandatory. In the proposed educational experiment we have adapted different basic molecular biology techniques designed to identify these species including PCR, multiplex PCR, PCR-based restriction endonuclease analysis and nuclear ribosomal RNA amplification. During the classes, students acquired the ability to search and align gene sequences, design primers, and use bioinformatics software. Also, in the performed experiments, fungal molecular taxonomy concepts were introduced and the obtained results demonstrated that classic identification (phenotypic) in some cases needs to be complemented with molecular-based techniques. As a conclusion we can state that we present an inexpensive and well accepted group of classes involving important concepts that can be recreated in any laboratory.

AB Reading the primary literature in a journal club format is an excellent practice where undergraduate students can develop their abilities in experimental data analysis and critical thinking, learn about new ideas and methods, and gain a foothold in scientific discourse. However, students are not familiar with the format, writing style, and depth of knowledge assumed when first reading journal articles. This can inhibit class discussion. To alleviate this problem, the author has instituted the use of dialectical notes in journal club, so that students fully engage the article. This novel use of a strategy borrowed from humanities has improved class participation. (C) 2012 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB Communicating an understanding of the forces and factors that determine a protein's structure is an important goal of many biology and biochemistry courses at a variety of levels. Many educators use computer software that allows visualization of these complex molecules for this purpose. Although visualization is in wide use and has been associated with student learning, it is quite challenging to develop visualizations that allow students to interactively observe the effects of altered amino acid sequence on protein structure. A software simulation, the protein investigator (PI), has been developed to specifically facilitate this type of exploration. When using the PI, students enter or edit an amino acid sequence; the software then simulates its folding in two dimensions using the major forces involved in protein structure. This study explores freshman undergraduate students' use of visualization and simulation when learning about protein structure. It also evaluates some of the learning outcomes from these two approaches. Our results show that simulation leads to similar learning outcomes as visualization. Because simulation allows a more interactive exploration, a combination of the two approaches may be an effective approach to introducing the basic principles of protein structure.

AB In the last decade, video games became a common vehicle for citizen science initiatives in life science, allowing participants to contribute to real scientific data analysis while learning about it. Since 2010, our scientific discovery game (SDG) Phylo enlists participants in comparative genomic data analysis. It is frequently used as a learning tool, but the activities were difficult to aggregate to build a coherent teaching activity. Here, we describe a strategy and series of recipes to facilitate the integration of SDGs in courses and implement this approach in Phylo. We developed new roles and functionalities enabling instructors to create assignments and monitor the progress of students. A story mode progressively introduces comparative genomics concepts, allowing users to learn and contribute to the analysis of real genomic sequences. Preliminary results from a user study suggest this framework may help to boost user motivation and clarify pedagogical objectives.

AB Common wisdom holds that ATP hydrolysis is spontaneous because of the weakness of its phosphoanhydride bonds, electrostatic repulsion within the polyanionic ATP(4-) molecule, and resonance stabilization of the inorganic phosphate and ADP products. By examining the pH-dependence of the hydrolysis Gibbs free energy, we show that in fact, above pH 7, ATP hydrolysis is spontaneous due mainly to the low concentration of the H+ that is released as product. Hence, ATP is essentially just an electrophilic target whose attack by H2O causes the acidity of the water nucleophile to increase dramatically; the spontaneity of the resulting acid ionization supplies much of the released Gibbs free energy. We also find that fermentation lowers pH not due to its organic acid products (e.g., lactic, acetic, formic, or succinic acids), but again, due to the H+ product of ATP hydrolysis.

AB Team-Based Learning (TBL) can be easily applied to different learning outcomes in various courses. This approach builds community and provides peer support for students in both in-person and online learning environments. When used for formative assessment, it can promote student learning while reducing the quantity of grading for instructors. Five simple tips to provide structure and flexibility for the successful implementation of Team-Based Learning are described using an example of a recent second-year principles of genetics course.

AB Laboratory-based practical classes are an essential component in teaching molecular biology for undergraduate students. Universidad Regional Amazonica Ikiam is a higher education institution located in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, a high biodiversity place, including amphibians. Based on this, we have established a practical molecular biology program with eight sessions that contextualize the biodiverse surroundings of the University. This program stimulates synchronization of information between theory and practice and improves research skills. During these sessions, students are motivated to identify and characterize antimicrobial peptides from Ecuadorian frog skin secretions, using molecular biology techniques and biochemistry and microbiology knowledge. This practical course was held twice with a total of 56 students from the fifth semester of the biotechnology engineering. The evaluation of the practical program was carried out through a questionnaire applied to students using the Likert scale. Overall, this form of teaching had high receptivity and presented benefits for student learning. Interestingly, 80% of respondents strongly agreed that this course provided tools and knowledge for the development of their undergraduate dissertation. Therefore, practical courses tailored to the student's context can stimulate student learning and interest. Additionally, this experimental methodology is interdisciplinary and can be applied to other research fields and subjects.

AB During the Covid-19 pandemic, all on-campus activities were required to be adapted to a distance-learning format, which was especially challenging for practical courses. Molecular biology is a mandatory course for biology undergraduates at Universidade Federal Fluminense. To overcome the impossibility of practical activities, we proposed problem-solving synthetic biology assignments to review and consolidate the knowledge acquired in the molecular biology course. A survey indicated that the synthetic biology challenges were effective to promote students' active learning and worked as a proper substitute to the practical classes.

AB Growing evidence suggests that students' self-beliefs about altering their academic abilities can directly influence long-term achievement. These self-beliefs or mindsets can either be fixed (unchangeable) or growth oriented. Students with growth mindsets believe their academic abilities can change, which leads to higher grades and academic persistence in contrast to students with fixed mindsets. However, less is known about how these attributes affect student learning, particularly in college level biochemistry courses. In this study, we utilized metacognitive interventions to promote growth mindset among third and fourth year undergraduate students enrolled in a one semester Biochemistry survey course. Using a mixed-methods study design, we evaluated student mindset, attitudes toward learning, and academic performance over four semesters. Our results suggest that although students' mindsets did not change as a result of growth mindset interventions, their positive perceptions about learning versus performance did increase. Furthermore, students receiving growth mindset interventions significantly outperformed students who did not receive interventions on the final cumulative exam that assessed critical thinking skills. These results suggest that these types of metacognitive interventions can be an effective tool to improve student academic performance in a biochemistry course.

AB A survey was carried out to investigate the knowledge, perception and interest of secondary school students about biotechnology. A total of 334 questionnaires were distributed to students in Senior Secondary 3 classes from eight secondary schools within Calabar metropolis. Data was collected and analyzed using SPSS version 7.5. Results revealed 105 (34.21%) of students had limited knowledge of medical biotechnology, genetic engineering and genetically modified products. 91 (30.03%) of the students agreed that biotechnology is the use of living organisms to produce goods and services while 102 (33.41%) accepted that biotechnology is a new technology based on biology 62 (20.39%) were willing to embrace the applications of biotechnology. 152 (50.03%) do not agree that biotech will improve services for mankind; 90 (29.51) had no idea about the applications of biotechnology; 31 (10.24%) students disagreed that cloning results in perfectly identical individuals while the highest positive responses; 92 (30.31%) was recorded for questions regarding in vitro fertilization. The students also showed a very low interest 76 (25%) in pursuing biotechnology as a degree in the University. Generally students' knowledge, perception, and interest in Biotechnology were low among Secondary School students in Calabar. There is a need to immediately increase enlightenment and emphasis on the applications of biotechnology among Secondary school students to enable them appreciate the benefits of biotechnology.

AB To obtain knowledge is not the purpose of education, but to develop one's potential ability and to obtain wisdom is. We are living in a fast changing world and knowledge is growing explosively. Therefore, what facts or information students have known in your class is not the most important thing. What really matters is how efficiently students could learn and how those knowledge they have learned can help them to deal with their own tasks in the future. This article introduces our four-dimensional comprehensive course design and the teaching activities we used to optimize and improve students' learning and developing process.

AB Flow cytometry has become an important tool in the life sciences and medical fields, yet there are often few opportunities for undergraduate students to receive training with this type of instrumentation as part of life science curricula at many colleges and universities. We describe a straightforward laboratory exercise designed for a college-level biochemistry course that uses flow cytometry to investigate changes in bacterial membrane potential and cell viability in response to various treatments. Anecdotally, we have noticed that many students often have difficulty understanding the concept of membrane potential and the essential role that it plays in cellular processes. Therefore, this exercise also provides a pedagogical tool for visualizing changes in cellular membrane potential as way to enhancing students' comprehension of this abstract concept. Students' understanding of flow cytometry and membrane potential was assessed using a preactivity and postactivity quiz; the results indicate that the students' understanding of these concepts significantly improved after they completed this laboratory exercise.

ID ACCUMULATION
AB Several models suggest ways to expose undergraduates at minority serving institutions or institutions with limited research infrastructures to the iterative process of research. Apprentice-based research experiences allow students to work one-on-one with a research mentor in the hands-on discovery process, but with teaching being a priority for faculty at the aforementioned institutions, financial, spatial, and time limitations for research progress exist. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide opportunities for a greater number of undergraduates to become familiar with the questions, techniques, and failure involved in research. However, designing projects that a group of students can complete in a semester can be challenging. Inclusive Research Education Communities are intended to promote retention in STEM courses for early college students but have limited benefit for upper-level courses. We sought to create an iterative CURE between fall semester BIOL3900 at the University of North Texas and spring semester CHE397 at Bethel University (Saint Paul, MN) to promote collaboration between unique learning communities. The research goal was to use a tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) transient expression system as a platform to test gene functions and to engineer valuable bioproducts in plant vegetative tissues. The outcomes of this 2-year integrative module included novel discoveries leading to publications in peer-reviewed journals, cost benefits due to shared resources, continual movement of the project, course-based training for future independent research projects, and improved student attitudes about research.

AB Next generation sequencing has revolutionized molecular biology and has provided a mechanism for rapid DNA and RNA sequence analysis. Yet, there are few resources to introduce next generation sequencing into the undergraduate biochemistry and molecular biology curriculum. Herein, we describe the design, execution, and assessment of a four-week laboratory for junior and senior undergraduate students that focuses on bacterial gene expression changes detected by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In the laboratory, students analyze a bacterial RNA-seq dataset in detail and answer questions relating to the impact of DNA methylation on bacterial gene expression. In addition, students confirm key results from the RNA-seq dataset using qRT-PCR and compare their results to similar experiments in the literature. A major strength of the laboratory is the ability of students to analyze raw RNA-seq data. In addition, another strength of the laboratory is the utilization of both dry approaches (informatics and statistics) and wet approaches (RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR) to answer bacterial gene expression questions. Assessment of the laboratory indicates that significant learning gains were achieved with respect to next generation sequencing and RNA-seq. We expect that the laboratory will be a valuable resource as is, or via modification with other datasets and projects.

ID INQUIRY
AB Biology graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) are a critical instructional group in the successful implementation of classroom reform efforts in higher education. Despite this, little is known about effective Teaching Professional Development (TPD) of this largely novice instructor group. This Idea to explore article proposes that a comparison of what we already know about novice K-12 science teachers beliefs about teaching and learning might inform future research into GTA TPD. As such, data related to teaching ability and practice beliefs is provided to compare and contrast these constructs in GTA and novice K-12 teacher groups.

AB Recent advancements in biochemical sciences have helped the researchers to explore the molecular logic of life inclusive of its multifarious expressions and explain many facts about the structure and functions of cellular macromolecules. Due to its simple and cost-effective nature, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has become the most favored technique for qualitative and quantitative examination of macromolecules. Major drawbacks of such modifications are the cost and operational complexities faced by naive students. Many interlinking laboratory equipment are needed in the school laboratories for the conduct of even simple scientific experiment. Some of these costly modern equipment are inaccessible for students of small laboratories, and their alternatives are not easily available. Many of these laboratory equipment required for routine gel electrophoresis technique can be fabricated in their simplest form using off-the-shelf components. A short term biochemistry training program was executed for high school students to provide them hands-on training using newly modified equipment, which was proved to be an exciting way of learning biochemical gel separation techniques.

AB Protein ORIGAMI () is a browser-based web application that allows the user to create straightforward 3D paper models of folded peptides for research, teaching and presentations. An amino acid sequence can be turned into -helices, -strands and random coils that can be printed out and folded into properly scaled models, with a color code denoting the biophysical characteristics of each amino acid residue (hydrophobicity, charge, etc.). These models provide an intuitive visual and tactile understanding of peptide interactions with other partners, such as helix-helix assembly, oligomerization, membrane binding, or pore formation. Helices can also be displayed as a helical wheel or helical mesh in 2D graphics, to be used in publications or presentations. The highly versatile programme Protein ORIGAMI is also suited to create less conventional helices with arbitrary pitch (e.g., 3(10)-helix, -helix, or left-handed helices). Noncanonical amino acids, labels and different terminal modifications can be defined and displayed at will, and different protonation states can be shown. In addition to the web application, the program source code can be downloaded and installed locally on a PC. The printed paper models can be readily used for daily research and discussions, just as for educational purposes and teaching.

AB In the human body, the adrenal steroids collectively regulate a plethora of fundamental functions, including electrolyte and water balance, blood pressure, stress response, intermediary metabolism, inflammation, and immunity. Therefore, adrenal steroidogenesis is an important biochemistry topic for students to learn in order for them to understand health consequences caused by deficiencies of enzymes in the adrenal steroidogenic pathways. However, popular biochemistry textbooks contain insufficient information and may sometimes give students a misimpression about certain aspects of human adrenal steroidogenesis. This article highlights two neglected issues in teaching human adrenal steroidogenesis in popular biochemistry textbooks. The purpose of this article is to draw attention to these issues.

AB A kinesthetic classroom activity was designed to help students understand enzyme activity and catalysis of reaction rate. Students served the role of enzymes by manipulating Pop-It Beads as the catalytic event. This activity illuminates the relationship between reaction rate and reaction progress by allowing students to experience first-hand the effect of substrate depletion on catalyzed reaction rate. Preliminary findings based on survey results and exam performance suggest the activity could prove beneficial to students in the targeted learning outcomes. Unique to previous kinesthetic approaches that model Michaelis-Menten kinetics, this activity models the effects of substrate depletion on catalyzed reaction rate. Therefore, it could prove beneficial for conveying the reasoning behind the initial rate simplification used in Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

ID DISCOURSE
AB Metadiscourse markers (MDMs) are lexical resources that writers employ to organize their discourse and state their stance towards the content or the reader. This study investigated the frequency with which interactive and interactional MDMs were employed in biological research articles (RAs). It also explored the possible relationship between the frequency of these markers and Impact Factor (IF) of journals as an index of quality. Moreover, it aimed at finding out the difference(s) between two groups of authors (Iranian and American) in their use of these markers. Forty biological RAs published in years 2008-2011 written by Iranian non-native authors and published in four ISI journals with different IFs and 40 articles with the same characteristics published by American native authors were selected and examined for the use of the markers. The results showed that there was a strong positive correlation between the frequency of MDMs and IF of the journals. Regarding the frequency of MDMs, it was observed that Iranian authors employed interactive and interactional markers slightly more than their American counterparts. These results may provisionally confirm the considerable role of MDMs in enhancing the coherence and organization of articles for possible publication in high-impact journals.

AB We have developed a multiweek laboratory project in which students isolate myoglobin and characterize its structure, function, and redox state. The important laboratory techniques covered in this project include size-exclusion chromatography, electrophoresis, spectrophotometric titration, and FTIR spectroscopy. Regarding protein structure, students work with computer modeling and visualization of myoglobin and its homologues, after which they spectroscopically characterize its thermal denaturation. Students also study protein function (ligand binding equilibrium) and are instructed on topics in data analysis (calibration curves, nonlinear vs. linear regression). This upper division biochemistry laboratory project is a challenging and rewarding one that not only exposes students to a wide variety of important biochemical laboratory techniques but also ties those techniques together to work with a single readily available and easily characterized protein, myoglobin.

AB Recently, a requirement for directed responsible conduct in research (RCR) education has become a priority in the United States and elsewhere. In the US, both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation require RCR education for all students who are financially supported by federal awards. The guidelines produced by these agencies offer useful templates for the introduction of RCR materials into courses worldwide. Many academic programs already offer courses or workshops in RCR for their graduate students and for undergraduate science majors and/or researchers. Introducing RCR into undergraduate biochemistry and molecular biology laboratory curricula is another, highly practical way that students can be exposed to these important topics. In fact, a strong argument can be made for integrating RCR into laboratory courses because these classes often introduce students to a scientific environment like that they might encounter in their careers after graduation. This article focuses on general strategies for incorporating explicit RCR education into biochemistry and molecular biology laboratory coursework using the topics suggested by NIH as a starting point.

AB We demonstrate that student engagement with PeerWise, an online tool that allows students to author and answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs), is associated with enhanced academic performance across diverse assessment types on a second year Genetics course. Benefits were consistent over three course deliveries, with differential benefits bestowed on groups of different prior ability. A rating scheme, to assess the educational quality of students' questions, is presented and demonstrates that our students are able intuitively to make such quality assessments, and that the process of authoring high quality questions alone does not explain the academic benefits. We further test the benefits of providing additional PeerWise support and conclude that PeerWise works efficiently with minimal intervention, and can be reliably assessed using automatically generated PeerWise scores.

AB In situ hybridization is a widely used technique for studying gene expression. Here, we describe two experiments addressed to postgraduate genetics students in which the effect of transcription factors on gene expression is analyzed in Drosophila embryos of different genotypes by whole-mount in situ hybridization. In one of the experiments, students analyzed the repressive effect of Snail over rhomboid expression using reporter lines containing different constructs of the rhomboid neuroectodermal enhancer fused to the lacZ gene. In the second experiment, the epistatic relationship between the cabut and decapentaplegic genes was analyzed. These simple experiments allowed students to (1) understand the role of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements over gene expression regulation and (2) practice a widespread laboratory technique, in situ hybridization with nonradioactive labeled probes, to detect gene expression patterns. These experiments required 12 hr and were organized into four daily sessions that included the discussion of the results with students. Examples of the results obtained and their relevance are shown and discussed herein. The methods described in these laboratory exercises can be easily adapted to model organisms other than Drosophila. (C) 2014 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB Instrumentation for real-time PCR is used primarily for amplification and quantitation of nucleic acids. The capability to measure fluorescence while controlling temperature in multiple samples can also be applied to the analysis of proteins. Conformational stability and changes in stability due to ligand binding are easily assessed. Protein structure studies possible with a real-time PCR instrument address core topics in biochemistry and have valuable high-throughput applications in the fields of drug discovery and protein engineering. Protein analysis using real-time PCR instrumentation has been incorporated in an undergraduate laboratory project based on previously described projects. Students express, purify, and characterize a protein. Based on literature research and analysis using bioinformatics tools, they select a specific mutation to investigate. They then attempt to express, purify, and characterize their mutated protein. Thermal denaturation using a real-time PCR instrument is the primary tool used to compare the wild-type and mutated proteins. Alternative means for incorporation of protein analysis by real-time PCR instrumentation into laboratory experiences and additional modes of analysis are also described.

AB Evolution is a main concept in biology, but not many students understand how it works. In this article we introduce the game DNA Re-EvolutioN as an active learning tool that uses genetic concepts (DNA structure, transcription and translation, mutations, natural selection, etc.) as playing rules. Students will learn about molecular evolution while playing a game that mixes up theory and entertainment. The game can be easily adapted to different educational levels. The main goal of this play is to arrive at the end of the game with the longest protein. Students play with pawns and dices, a board containing hypothetical events (mutations, selection) that happen to molecules, Evolution cards with indications for DNA mutations, prototypes of a DNA and a mRNA chain with colored nucleotides (plasticine balls), and small pieces simulating t-RNA with aminoacids that will serve to construct a protein based on the DNA chain. Students will understand how changes in DNA affect the final protein product and may be subjected to positive or negative selection, using a didactic tool funnier than classical theory lectures and easier than molecular laboratory experiments: a flexible and feasible game to learn and enjoy molecular evolution at no-cost. The game was tested by majors and non-majors in genetics from 13 different countries and evaluated with pre- and post-tests obtaining very positive results.

AB Providing a project-based experience in an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory class can be complex with large class sizes and limited resources. We have designed a 6-week curriculum during which students purify and characterize the enzymes invertase and phosphatase from bakers yeast. Purification is performed in two stages via ethanol precipitation and anion exchange chromatography, and students perform both direct and coupled enzyme assays. By completion of the experimental series, students are able to identify which enzymes they have purified and have obtained kinetic parameters for one. This experimental series requires minimal instructor preparation time, is cost effective, and works with multiple sections of large groups of students. Students participating in this sequence showed increases in conceptual understanding of biochemical concepts as measured through in-class assessments and anonymous surveys.

AB Concepts from disciplines such as Biochemistry, Genetics, Cellular and Molecular Biology are essential to the understanding and treatment of an elevated number of illnesses, but often they are studied separately, with no integration between them. This article proposes a model for basic sciences integration based on problem-based learning (PBL) and compares failure rate, global final grade, approved student final grade, grade distribution and students' satisfaction with teacher conduction between integrated curriculum and traditional learning in health courses from Anhembi Morumbi Universitya private institution from Brazil. Comparison between integrated and traditional curriculum was based on students' records obtained from first-year health sciences students. A total of 1,697 records from 2005 to 2007 (nonintegrated curriculum) and 785 records from 2008 (integrated curriculum) were selected for this study and they were necessary to get information about students' grades. Moreover, a questionnaire was applied in order to cover student's satisfaction with teacher conduction. The data presented in this study indicated that the integrated curriculum based on PBL was related to an improvement in student's grades and satisfaction compared with traditional teaching. We believe that the effectiveness in health education will be a combination of classical presentation of contents associated to actively involved students in the educational process and methodology based on problems in order to create the stimulus for the undergraduates continue to integrate basic and clinical investigation.

ID CHEMISTRY; STUDENTS
AB In introductory biochemistry courses, it is often a struggle to teach the basic concepts of acid-base chemistry in a manner that is relevant to biological systems. To help students gain a more intuitive and visual understanding of abstract acid-base concepts, a simple graphical construct called the pH ruler Java applet was developed. The applet allows students to visualize the abundance of different protonation states of diprotic and triprotic amino acids at different pH values. Using the applet, the student can drag a widget on a slider bar to change the pH and observe in real time changes in the abundance of different ionization states of this amino acid. This tool provides a means for developing more complex inquiry-based, active-learning exercises to teach more advanced topics of biochemistry, such as protein purification, protein structure and enzyme mechanism.

AB We have realized that our Biology undergraduate students learn biological concepts as established truths without awareness of the body of experimental evidence supporting the emerging models as usually presented in handbooks and texts in general. Therefore, we have implemented a laboratory practice in our course of Physiology and Biophysics, aimed to introduce the students in the way the scientific models and theories are built, through the measurement of Na+ transport in frog skin. Transepithelial Na+ transport was assessed in the frog skin, with measurements of short circuit currents. The mucosal Na+ and serosal K+ concentrations were modified and the effects were recorded. These effects were reversible. Addition of a drug that blocks epithelial Na+ channels (amiloride) to the mucosal side solution abolished the short circuit current. Sodium fluxes were calculated, and the results were adjusted to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The impact of the proposed practice on the students is discussed.

AB Molecular docking is a frequently used method in structure-based rational drug design. It is used for evaluating the complex formation of small ligands with large biomolecules, predicting the strength of the bonding forces and finding the best geometrical arrangements. The major goal of this advanced undergraduate biochemistry laboratory exercise is to illustrate the importance and application of this tool. Students carry out the computational modeling of the interaction of acetylcholinesterase and its inhibitor, tacrine, and learn about the concepts of protein structure, enzyme-inhibitor interactions, intermolecular forces, and role of molecular design in drug-development.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) remains an important tool in the study of biological systems by proteomics. While the use of 2DGE is commonplace in research publications, there are few instructional laboratories that address the use of 2DGE for analyzing complex protein samples. One reason for this lack is the fact that the preparation of samples for 2DGE is a complex and difficult process that can commonly yield gels of poor quality and resolution. In this experiment, we use a serum-based sample to mitigate many of the sample preparation issues that occur in cell-based sample preparations and incorporate a protein precipitation method that was developed to address the problem of high-abundance proteins and dynamic range in serum proteomics research. By focusing on 2DGE apart from many other facets of proteomic experimental design, students have the opportunity to gain fruitful experience in the use of this workhorse proteomics technique. This simplified focus also makes this exercise accessible to biochemistry instructors who are not active in proteomics; the requisite techniques may require some new equipment (i.e. an isoelectric focusing apparatus), but this exercise focuses on using familiar techniques (primarily electrophoresis) to cross the threshold of a new field, proteomics.

AB Problem Based Learning (PBL) makes use of real-life scenarios to stimulate students' prior knowledge and to provide a meaningful context that is also related to the student's future professional work. In this article, Paternity testing is presented using a PBL approach that involves a combination of classroom, laboratory, and out-of-class activities: in relation to a fictitious newborn found on the Campus, students design a PCR based protocol to determine their own genotype for two markers. Pooled class genotypes serve to calculate allelic frequencies and to assess Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Individual results are also evaluated for possible paternity. The goals of the activity and how each step in the process relates to learning outcomes are presented. Classroom discussions, group discussions, tutorial sessions, wiki sites, laboratory activities, and individual reports sum up the situations, in which the students' process of learning and learning outcomes can be evaluated.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the Bioinformatics course to switch from on-site teaching to remote learning. This shift has prompted a change in teaching methods and laboratory activities. Students need to have a basic understanding of DNA sequences and how to analyze them using custom scripts. To facilitate learning, we have modified the course to use Jupyter Notebook, which offers an alternative approach to writing custom scripts for basic DNA sequence analysis. This approach allows students to acquire the necessary skills while working remotely. It is a versatile and user-friendly platform that can be used to combine explanations, code, and results in a single document. This feature enables students to interact with the code and results, making the learning process more engaging and effective. Jupyter Notebook provides a hybrid approach to learning basic Python scripting and genomics that is effective for remote teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Nowadays, novel Biochemistry lab techniques are being introduced at a very fast pace in scientific research. This requires development of new labs for undergraduate Biochemistry courses to equip the students with up-to-date techniques. However, the time limit of Biochemistry labs for undergraduate students represents a major obstacle. This article presents a clear set of laboratory exercises designed to introduce students to the use of polymerase chain reaction-restriction-fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) as a means of detection of genetic variants. Three consecutive lab experiments have been designed for the undergraduate students to serve this purpose. The first session was performed in a computer lab (dry lab) where students were taught how to obtain a specific gene sequence, identify an exact single nucleotide polymorphism location, choose the target sequence for amplification, design specific primers for this particular sequence and choose the most suitable restriction enzyme from web tools. The second and third lab sessions were performed as wet labs where in the second lab session, students optimized PCR conditions and performed a successful PCR. The PCR products were kept for use in the third lab session where they utilized the selected restriction enzyme and carried out gel electrophoresis to determine the exact genotype.

AB Western blot (WB) or immunoblot is a workhorse method. It is commonly used by biologists for study of different aspects of protein biomolecules. In addition, it has been widely used in disease diagnosis. Despite some limitations such as long time, different applications of WB have not been limited. In the present review, we have summarized scientific and clinical applications of WB. In addition, we described some new generation of WB techniques.

AB The COVID-19 outbreak has shut down universities and prompted the teaching faculty to move to online resources. In view of upcoming of new Medical Council of India (MCI) curriculum and outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, keeping pace with medical education became a challenge. To keep on par with learning activities of undergraduate students during this period, the teaching faculty adopted the use of online resources. E-learning tools were utilized to engage first-year undergraduate students and satisfy majority of aspects of Competency-Based Undergraduate Medical Curriculum/Education (CBMC/E) in Biochemistry.

AB An approach for incorporating preliminary drug discovery research into a biochemistry laboratory is described. During a total of 42 hr (one 3-hr laboratory section a week for 14 weeks), students were exposed to bioinformatics; molecular cloning; protein expression, purification, and characterization; and enzymatic kinetic assays. This research-oriented laboratory not only includes the standard elements of common undergraduate biochemistry laboratory manuals but also emphasizes the logical connections among biochemistry laboratory techniques. Moreover, this approach exposed students to laboratory research and the concept of drug discovery.

AB This study presents the integration of three different teaching scenarios, during biology laboratory lessons, with the overall aim of exploring the potential predominant effectiveness of teaching and improvement of students' learning, by the use of the three-dimensional virtual reality educational tool Onlabs, versus more traditional didactic practices. A sample of 83, fourth year, undergraduate students of the Primary Education Department of Patras' University in Greece, were equally separated into three cognitively balanced groups to be educated on the light microscopy experiment by three different educational scenarios. Students' conceptual understanding in the domain of microscopy, was evaluated during all learning procedure with Pre and Post tests, whereas their skill to handle properly a real light microscope in the wet biology lab was summatively assessed via a specially designed work sheet. Results of the present study provide evidence in favor of the virtual reality application. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2019.

SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE Michaelis-Menten kinetics; enzymes; animation
AB The mathematical models that describe enzyme kinetics are invaluable predictive tools in numerous scientific fields. However, the daunting mathematical language used to describe kinetic behavior can be confusing for life science students; they often struggle to conceptualize and relate the mathematical representations to the molecular phenomena occurring at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Students with less developed abstract and mathematical thinking skills may benefit from a visual learning approach. The paucity of visual resources for enzyme kinetics makes this a fertile field for developing novel learning media. We discuss developing a three-dimensional animation aimed at introducing key concepts of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics to undergraduate life science students. This animation uses both realistic and metaphoric depictions of the underlying molecular players, environments, and interactions in enzyme kinetics to contextualize and explain the relationship between the mathematical models and underlying molecular systems. The animation can be viewed at bit.ly/michaelis-menten. (c) 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(5):561-565, 2018.

TI The Disruptive Effect of Lysozyme on the Bacterial Cell Wall Explored by

ID PROTEIN DATA-BANK
AB The bacterial cell wall, a structural unit of peptidoglycan polymer comprised of glycan strands consisting of a repeating disaccharide motif [N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramylpentapeptide (NAM pentapeptide)], encases bacteria and provides structural integrity and protection. Lysozymes are enzymes that break down the bacterial cell wall and disrupt the bacterial life cycle by cleaving the linkage between the NAG and NAM carbohydrates. Lab exercises focused on the effects of lysozyme on the bacterial cell wall are frequently incorporated in biochemistry classes designed for undergraduate students in diverse fields as biology, microbiology, chemistry, agronomy, medicine, and veterinary medicine. Such exercises typically do not include structural data. We describe here a sequence of computer tasks designed to illustrate and reinforce both physiological and structural concepts involved in lysozyme effects on the bacterial cell-wall structure. This lab class usually lasts 3.5 hours. First, the instructor presents introductory concepts of the bacterial cell wall and the effect of lysozyme on its structure. Then, students are taught to use computer modeling to visualize the three-dimensional structure of a lysozyme in complex with bacterial cell-wall fragments. Finally, the lysozyme inhibitory effect on a bacterial culture is optionally proposed as a simple microbiological assay. The computer lab exercises described here give students a realistic understanding of the disruptive effect of lysozymes on the bacterial cell wall, a crucial component in bacterial survival.

AB Over the past few years, a new research field has emerged, focusing on the social-scientific criteria for the study of opinions toward genetically modified foods (GMFs), since these may be limiting factors for the success or failure of these products. Basic education is the first step in the Mexican education system, and teachers may wield an outsized influence on the attitudes and preferences of children, prospective future consumers of these products. To better understand the current state of knowledge of biotechnology issues and opinions toward the consumption of GMF of Mexican teachers, a questionnaire was distributed, and 362 Mexican teachers of basic education responded. The survey included questions about the benefits and risks of consuming GMF. The mean percentage of teachers expressing knowledge of a given topic in biotechnology was 50%. More than 60% of teachers believed that GMFs would be useful in preventing world hunger, while 39.2% considered GMF to be hazards for future generations. Although 47.0% reported not having enough knowledge about these topics, almost all (90.3%) respondents expressed an interest and willingness to learn about biotechnology. In light of the fact that teachers of basic education represent the first and potentially most lasting stage in the education of young children, this survey establishes the urgent need to develop strategies to improve the scientific knowledge of teachers and to facilitate decision making and the promotion of scientific and technological advances for their students.

AB Recognizing that undergraduate students can benefit from analysis of 3D protein structure and function, we have developed a multiweek, inquiry-based molecular visualization project for Biochemistry I students. This project uses a virtual model of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) to guide students through multiple levels of protein structure analysis. The first assignment explores primary structure by generating and examining a protein sequence alignment. Subsequent assignments introduce 3D visualization software to explore secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. Students design an inhibitor, based on scrutiny of the enzyme active site, and evaluate the fit of the molecule using computed binding energies. In the last assignment, students introduce a point mutation to model the active site of the related COX-2 enzyme and analyze the impact of the mutation on inhibitor binding. With this project we aim to increase knowledge about, and confidence in using, online databases and computational tools. Here, we share results of our mixed methods pre- and postsurvey demonstrating student gains in knowledge about, and confidence using, online databases and computational tools.

AB Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) represent a novel type of adaptive immune system found in eubacteria and archaebacteria. CRISPRs have recently generated a lot of attention due to their unique ability to catalog foreign nucleic acids, their ability to destroy foreign nucleic acids in a mechanism that shares some similarity to RNA interference, and the ability to utilize reconstituted CRISPR systems for genome editing in numerous organisms. In order to introduce CRISPR biology into an undergraduate upper-level laboratory, a five-week set of exercises was designed to allow students to examine the CRISPR status of uncharacterized Escherichia coli strains and to allow the discovery of new repeats and spacers. Students started the project by isolating genomic DNA from E. coli and amplifying the iap CRISPR locus using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were analyzed by Sanger DNA sequencing, and the sequences were examined for the presence of CRISPR repeat sequences. The regions between the repeats, the spacers, were extracted and analyzed with BLASTN searches. Overall, CRISPR loci were sequenced from several previously uncharacterized E. coli strains and one E. coli K-12 strain. Sanger DNA sequencing resulted in the discovery of 36 spacer sequences and their corresponding surrounding repeat sequences. Five of the spacers were homologous to foreign (non-E. coli) DNA. Assessment of the laboratory indicates that improvements were made in the ability of students to answer questions relating to the structure and function of CRISPRs. Future directions of the laboratory are presented and discussed. (c) 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 45(3):262-269, 2017.

AB Evidence shows that science graduates often do not have the communication skills they need to meet workplace standards and expectations. One common mode of science communication is the poster. In a review of the literature we show that poster design is historically problematic, and that the guidance provided to students as they create posters for assessment is frequently inconsistent. To address this inconsistency we provide some guiding design principles for posters that are grounded in communication theory and the fundamentals of rhetoric. We also present three nondiscipline-specific example posters with accompanying notes that explain why the posters are examples of poor, average, and excellent poster design. The subject matter for the posters is a fabricated set of experiments on a topic that could not actually be the subject of research. Instructors may use these resources with their students, secure in the knowledge that they do not and will never represent an answer set to an extant assessment item.

ID EXPERIENCE
AB Engaging undergraduates in research is essential for teaching them to think like scientists, and it has become a desired component of classroom and laboratory instruction. Research projects that span an entire semester expose students to a variety of concepts and techniques and allow students to use experiments to learn scientific principles, understand why specific techniques are applicable, critically analyze varied data, and examine how experimentation leads to acquiring knowledge. To provide an experience with these features, a semester long research project was integrated into a combined lecture and laboratory course, Molecular Biology. The project utilized the zebrafish model to examine gene expression during embryonic development and required students to develop and test hypotheses about the timing of expression of previously uncharacterized genes. The main goals for the project were to provide opportunities for students to develop critical thinking skills required for conducting research and to support the content goals of the course. To determine whether these goals were met, student performance on the steps of the project and related pre-test and post-test questions was examined.

AB Graduate medical students of India are taught Biochemistry by didactic lectures and they hardly get any opportunity to clarify their doubts and reinforce the concepts which they learn in these lectures. We used a combination of teaching-learning (T-L) methods (open book assignment followed by group tutorials) to study their efficacy in improving the learning outcome. About 143 graduate medical students were classified into low (<50%: group 1, n=23), medium (50-75%: group 2, n=74), and high (>75%: group 3, n=46) achievers, based on their internal assessment marks. After the regular teaching module on the topics Vitamins and Enzymology, all the students attempted an open book assignment without peer consultation. Then all the students participated in group tutorials. The effects on the groups were evaluated by pre and posttests at the end of each phase, with the same set of MCQs. Gain from group tutorials and overall gain was significantly higher in the low achievers, compared to other groups. High and medium achievers obtained more gain from open book assignment, than group tutorials. The overall gain was significantly higher than the gain obtained from open book assignment or group tutorials, in all three groups. All the three groups retained the gain even after 1 week of the exercise. Hence, optimal use of novel T-L methods (open book assignment followed by group tutorials) as revision exercises help in strengthening concepts in Biochemistry in this oft neglected group of low achievers in graduate medical education.

AB Evolution has been recognized as a key concept for biologists. To enhance comprehension and motivate biology undergraduates for the contents of central energetic metabolism, we addressed the Krebs cycle structure and functions in an evolutionary view. To this end, we created a study guide that contextualizes the emergence of the cyclic pathway, in light of the prokaryotic influence since the early anaerobic condition of the Earth to increase oxygen in the atmosphere. The study guide is composed of three interrelated sections: (1) a problem, designed to arouse curiosity, inform and motivate students, (2) a text about life evolution, including early microorganisms and the emergence of the Krebs cycle, and (3) questions for debate. The activity consisted on individual reading and peer discussion based on this written material, under the guidance of the instructors. The questions were designed to foster debate in an ever-increasing level of complexity and to strengthen the main contextual aspects leading to emergence, evolving, and permanency of a complex metabolic pathway. Based on classroom observation, analysis of student's written responses, and individual interviews, we noticed they were engaged and motivated by the task, especially during group discussion. The whole experience suggests that the study guide was a stimulus to broaden the comprehension of the Krebs cycle, reinforcing the evolutionary approach as an important subject for learning purposes.

AB Metabolomics is a key discipline in systems biology, together with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. In this omics cascade, the metabolome represents the biochemical products that arise from cellular processes and is often regarded as the final response of a biological system to environmental or genetic changes. The overall screening approach to identify all the metabolites in a given biological system is called metabolic fingerprinting. Using high-resolution and high-mass accuracy mass spectrometry, large metabolome coverage, sensitivity, and specificity can be attained. Although the theoretical concepts of this methodology are usually provided in life-science programs, hands-on laboratory experiments are not usually accessible to undergraduate students. Even if the instruments are available, there are not simple laboratory protocols created specifically for teaching metabolomics. We designed a straightforward hands-on laboratory experiment to introduce students to this methodology, relating it to biochemical knowledge through metabolic pathway mapping of the identified metabolites. This study focuses on mitochondrial metabolomics since mitochondria have a well-known, medium-sized cellular sub-metabolome. These features facilitate both data processing and pathway mapping. In this experiment, students isolate mitochondria from potatoes, extract the metabolites, and analyze them by high-resolution mass spectrometry (using an FT-ICR mass spectrometer). The resulting mass list is submitted to an online program for metabolite identification, and compounds associated with mitochondrial pathways can be highlighted in a metabolic network map.

AB RNA mediated gene interference (RNAi) is now a key tool in eukaryotic cell and molecular biology research. This article describes a five session laboratory practical, spread over a seven day period, to introduce and illustrate the technique. During the exercise, students working in small groups purify PCR products that encode in vitro transcription promoters fused to sequences from Drosophila genes of the Rho/Rac GTPase family. These DNA templates are then used to synthesize double stranded RNAs (dsRNA), which are subsequently used to transfect Drosophila Kc embryonic cells. The resulting RNAi produces simple cellular phenotypes that are observed following fluorescent histochemical staining. These phenotypes are ultimately related to gene ontology data that the students generate through a bioinformatic analysis of the sequences transcribed into dsRNA. Taken together, this laboratory exercise provides "hands on'' experience of RNAi in a class setting and provides a framework for the in-depth discussion of how this technique can be applied to studies of gene function.

AB Dutch genomics research centers have developed the 'DNA labs on the road' to bridge the gap between modern genomics research practice and secondary-school curriculum in the Netherlands. These mobile DNA labs offer upper-secondary students the opportunity to experience genomics research through experiments with laboratory equipment that is not available in schools and place genomics research in a relevant societal context. The design of the DNA lab 'read the language of the tumor' is evaluated, by clarifying the goals and choices in the design, and the effects of the DNA lab are presented. Based on the analysis of the design of the DNA lab and supported by the results of the evaluating studies, we consider this module to be a good example of relevant and up-to-date genomics education.

AB We describe here two open-ended laboratory investigations for an undergraduate laboratory course that uses students' DNA as templates for quantitative real-time PCR and for traditional PCR followed by RFLP analysis. Students are captivated by the immediacy of the application and the relevance of the genotypes and traits, lactase persistence or nonpersistence, under study. Concepts ranging from nucleotide polymorphisms to natural selection can be demonstrated and reinforced by these laboratories. Students have a high degree of success with the laboratories and both objective and self-assessments of student learning indicate that concepts and techniques are better understood following implementation of these laboratory investigations.

AB Online case-based learning (CBL) is a method used by King Abdulaziz University to teach medical students in their preclinical years. The use of CBL in basic sciences is important for enabling medical students to correlate basic sciences with future clinical practice. This study implemented online CBL for biochemistry teaching as part of the medical genetic module for 3rd-year preclinical students. Teaching during the study was completely online because of restricted precautions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, except for practical sessions that were held on campus. The case was presented to the students involved in prenatal screening and diagnosis. Students were guided to learn and discuss the biochemical tests used for prenatal screening and diagnosis and their clinical importance. They were divided into two groups: the control group was given an online lecture and the intervention group was given an online CBL session before the lecture. The online lecture was given to both groups simultaneously by the same instructor, and then 10 MCQs tests were distributed to both groups after the lecture, and their test scores were compared. A 10-question survey was administered to the intervention group to assess their perception of the online CBL session after the test. A significant difference was found between the intervention and control groups regarding test scores (p < 0.001), and most students found the online CBL session enjoyable and motivating.

AB Higher education has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupting universities worldwide. Unexpectedly, the global academic community was forced to transition to remote and online learning. In many cases, fragilities in the systems of the higher education institutions were exposed, pointing to the need for investment in developing more digital solutions, infrastructure, and teaching modalities. In the post-COVID-19 era, the development and adoption of robust pedagogical modalities is crucial to provide the education systems with effective strategies for designing high-quality courses. Since 2008, MOOCs have been widely used to support billions of students worldwide with flexible, accessible, and high-quality learning experiences. This study attempts to investigate the effectiveness of adopting the MOOC-based flipped approach. We present findings and lessons learned from adopting this approach in two different biology classes using the MITx online materials. Findings on students' preparedness, students' performance, MOOCs integration evaluation, and during-pandemic approach assessment are also explained. In general, the results indicated that students favored the overall experience and the implemented approach. Since the online learning is currently at an evolving stage in Egypt, we believe this study's results might be beneficial for policymakers and Egyptian education institutions in designing strategies to improve the education process.

AB While the innovativeness of the flipped classroom (FC) approach promotes active participation and higher-order thinking among students, there are concerns about its effectiveness in terms of knowledge retention. Currently, there are no studies involving medical school biochemistry that evaluate this aspect of effectiveness. Thus, we conducted a historical control study that analyzed observational data from two freshman batches of the Doctor of Medicine program in our institution. Class 2021 (n = 250) served as the traditional lecture (TL) group while Class 2022 (n = 264) served as the FC group. Data on relevant observed covariates (age, sex, National Medical Admission Test or NMAT score, undergraduate degree) and the outcome variable (carbohydrate metabolism course unit examination percentage scores, as indicator of knowledge retention) were included in the analysis. Propensity scores were calculated using logit regression conditional on these observed covariates. Afterwards, 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to produce an estimated average treatment effect (ATE) measure afforded by FC (as adjusted mean difference in examination scores between the two batches), balancing on the covariates. Nearest-neighbor matching using the calculated propensity scores effectively balanced the two groups (standardized bias <10%), producing 250 matched student-pairs that received either TL or FC. Following PSM, the FC group was found to have a significantly higher adjusted mean examination score compared to the TL group (adjusted mean difference = 5.62%, 95% CI: 2.54%, 8.72%; p < 0.001). Using this approach, we were able to demonstrate benefit of FC over TL in terms of knowledge retention, as reflected by the estimated ATE.

AB Ethanol (EtOH) is among the most consumed drugs in the world. The behavior of humans after ingestion of this drug is characteristic: At low doses it may be excitatory and at higher doses, it may induce depressant/sedative effects. Similar effects are observed in the zebrafish experimental model (Danio rerio), which has about 70% genetic similarity with humans and has been widely used in numerous research. With the objective of improving the learning of biochemistry students, this work aimed to develop a practical exercise in the laboratory for students to observe the behavioral repertoire of zebrafish under the effects of exposure to ethanol. Through this practical class, the students were able to observe the similarity of the behavior of the animal model with that of humans, showing its importance for the consolidation of knowledge, awakening in the students an interest in science and its applications in everyday life.

AB Biochemistry is believed to be a difficult subject to understand for most life science and medical students. This article explains an experience with a flowchart-based teaching approach that is applicable to different kinds of biochemistry courses (basic, medical, and clinical) for undergraduate and postgraduate students. After preparing the flowcharts, they were given to the students at the beginning of the semester, and the flowchart-based teaching was performed for a whole semester. At the end of the semester, they were asked about the effectiveness and facilitation of learning using flowchart-based teaching. This survey was performed for several semesters. Approximately, 95% stated that it facilitates learning and understanding.

AB Biochemistry, a complicated basic course in health sciences, plays a fundamental role in describing pathogenic mechanism of illness in molecular terms, and is required to be learned for all medical students. Due to various obstacles to biochemistry learning and teaching, there is a pressing issue of curriculum reform to arouse the student's enthusiasm in biochemistry learning. In this study, an integrated topic-based biochemistry training program (TBBTP) combining the traditional lectures, question-based learning and experimental practices, was introduced in biochemistry teaching. Its effectiveness was evaluated through examination and questionnaire analyses. Consequently, we found that TBBTP promoted the dissemination of biochemical knowledge via traditional lecture, designated learning issues and experimental practices, and acquisition of various skills through practical operation, presentation, and independent learning. It motivated students to study biochemistry with intense interest and enthusiasm. This study explored the feasibility of the topic-based biochemistry teaching as a supplement to biochemistry curriculum in medical education and as a mainstream pedagogy in biochemistry lab.

AB Through the special situation like the COVID-2019 lockdown, interactive techniques play a prime role in the study process. The strategy of lockdown ways of higher education was provided in Ukraine as well as in other countries since March 2020. Our investigation was performed at the Department of Biochemistry and Medical Chemistry of Dnipro State Medical University during the first lockdown of COVID-19 from March to June 2020. The main aim of the research was the evaluation of the students' attitudes to studying Biochemistry using Google classrooms and Moodle. Four hundred and sixty-three students studying in English, French, and Ukrainian took part in the survey. Our results reveal that majority of the students found Google classrooms and Moodle as useful e-learning tools. However, questions dealing with the technical issues of using the Google classrooms on laptops and mobile phones and submitting the replies to the Google classrooms cause difficulties among the students.

AB A Lego Serious Play (LSP) - based exercise was developed to support student engagement with learning consolidation at the end of a first-year undergraduate cell biology course. The exercise was offered in addition to a regular revision session in preparation for the summative exam. Students were studying four-year BSc (Hons) degrees in: Animal Biology, Environmental Biology, Marine and Freshwater Biology, Biological Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Microbiology & Biotechnology in Scotland, UK. Although many students studied Human Biology at High School, in-depth cell biology was studied for the first time by the majority of students during this course. The LSP process was adapted for use in the classroom. Core concepts were identified from the twelve-week cell biology course as the basis for LSP build challenges and incorporated into LSP build - share - reflect cycles by students individually and then joined together by the group to explore the interconnected nature of cell biology processes. Student and lecturer evaluations were thematically analyzed to explore the impact of the technique on student engagement. Results indicate that the method supports student cognitive and affective engagement who report improved and understanding of the topic, and enjoyment and interest. In addition, behavioral engagement such as learner interaction, independence, and empowerment were revealed by the lecturer interview. Identified barriers to the adoption of LSP include perceived issues around creativity, play and exploration and scientific identity, together with a lack of evidence of efficacy. This study seeks to remedy that gap.

AB In the Fall of 2016, we created an integrated introductory biology/chemistry course for first-semester students at Wellesley College. This course was designed to meaningfully integrate chemistry and molecular cell biology while also building community and fostering mentorship both inside and outside the classroom. Here, we describe the assessment of this integrated course through a combination of multivariate analyses of student transcript data and student focus group discussions. Our assessment found that the integrated course provided a strongly collaborative working environment for students that provided them with skills that promoted success in future courses. Along with a rigorous consideration of the interplay between biology and chemistry, these skills appeared to support positive longer-term student outcomes. In particular, we observed significant impacts on student persistence into and performance in intermediate and advanced courses. Students from the integrated course were also significantly more likely to declare a major in biochemistry than students who took one of the traditional introductory courses. In addition, our assessment also noted the importance of a cohesive instructional team and broad faculty participation in the success and sustainability of the course.

AB Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become an important tool in the biological sciences and has a growing number of applications across medical fields. Currently, few undergraduate programs provide training in the design and implementation of NGS applications. Here, we describe an inquiry-based laboratory exercise for a college-level molecular biology laboratory course that uses real-time MinION deep sequencing and bioinformatics to investigate characteristic genetic variants found in cancer cell-lines. The overall goal for students was to identify non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell-lines based on their unique genomic profiles. The units described in this laboratory highlight core principles in multiplex PCR primer design, real-time deep sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis for genetic variants. We found that the MinION device is an appropriate, feasible tool that provides a comprehensive, hands-on NGS experience for undergraduates. Student evaluations demonstrated increased confidence in using molecular techniques and enhanced understanding of NGS concepts. Overall, this exercise provides a pedagogical tool for incorporating NGS approaches in the teaching laboratory as way of enhancing students' comprehension of genomic sequence analysis. Further, this NGS lab module can easily be added to a variety of lab-based courses to help undergraduate students learn current DNA sequencing methods with limited effort and cost.

AB Team teaching is an innovative method to engage the large group and make lectures more interesting. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of team teaching in first year biochemistry lecture classes. After obtaining ethical clearance, 150 first year medical undergraduate students participated in the study on a voluntary basis. Topic identified for team teaching was "Protein biosynthesis" in Biochemistry, which was designed to be carried out in 5 h of lecture by three teachers. At the end of the team teaching module and traditional lectures, a structured anonymous feedback was obtained from the students. At the end of each class, students' understanding of the lecture was assessed by an MCQ test comprising 5-6 items, which mainly tested the recollection and understanding levels of Bloom's taxonomy. This was compared with traditional lectures. The mean MCQ test score was significantly higher for team teaching when compared to traditional teaching. The students had increased attention span and were able to answer questions from later part of the class in team lectures. The students had reported that lectures taught by team were more interesting and informative. They also felt that the team was more receptive to the doubts raised, stimulated discussion on the topic and had a better rapport with the class.

AB The core concept of genetic information flow was identified in recent calls to improve undergraduate biology education. Previous work shows that students have difficulty differentiating between the three processes of the Central Dogma (CD; replication, transcription, and translation). We built upon this work by developing and applying an analytic coding rubric to 1050 student written responses to a three-question item about the CD. Each response was previously coded only for correctness using a holistic rubric. Our rubric captures subtleties of student conceptual understanding of each process that previous work has not yet captured at a large scale. Regardless of holistic correctness scores, student responses included five or six distinct ideas. By analyzing common co-occurring rubric categories in student responses, we found a common pair representing two normative ideas about the molecules produced by each CD process. By applying analytic coding to student responses preinstruction and postinstruction, we found student thinking about the processes involved was most prone to change. The combined strengths of analytic and holistic rubrics allow us to reveal mixed ideas about the CD processes and provide a detailed picture of which conceptual ideas students draw upon when explaining each CD process.

AB In order to succeed in biochemistry, students must transfer and build upon their understanding of general chemistry and introductory biology concepts. One such critical area of knowledge is bioenergetics. Student misconceptions around energy and free energy must be addressed prior to learning more advanced topics, such as energy flow in metabolic reactions. In this article, we present a series of active-learning videos with embedded questions to address these crucial topics. This video module achieves the following goals: (1) review fundamental chemistry concepts, (2) introduce concepts of reaction coupling and ATP hydrolysis, and (3) foreshadow more advanced biochemical topics such as metabolism. These videos are offered free of charge as traditional videos through YouTube and as an active-learning video module through an online platform, Edpuzzle. Access to videos is provided at .

AB The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread lock-down strategies that force universities to perform all educational activities remotely. In this context, laboratory lessons pose a significant challenge. Here, I present an on-line tool that simulates the kinetics of chemical reactions. Enzymatic mechanisms can be easily modeled and followed through time. In addition, professors can customize the interface to hide the reaction mechanism. This setting will force students to design virtual experiments to uncover the mechanism and obtain the relevant enzymatic parameters. While some of the skills developed in a practical lesson cannot be simulated, this tool can be used to teach students important concepts about data acquisition and processing.

AB For 20 years, Molecule of the Month articles have highlighted the functional stories of 3D structures found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDB is the primary archive of atomic structures of biological molecules, currently providing open access to more than 150,000 structures studied by researchers around the world. The wealth of knowledge embodied in this resource is remarkable, with structures that allow exploration of nearly any biomolecular topic, including the basic science of genetic mechanisms, mechanisms of photosynthesis and bioenergetics, and central biomedical topics like cancer therapy and the fight against infectious disease. The central motivation behind the Molecule of the Month is to provide a user-friendly introduction to this rich body of data, charting a path for users to get started with finding and exploring the many available structures. The Molecule of the Month and related materials are updated regularly at the education portal PDB-101 (), offering an ongoing resource for molecular biology educators and students around the world.

AB In this article, we describe an in-house polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific priming (PCR-SSP) assay designed for undergraduate medical students as part of the experimental pathogen biology and immunology (EPBI) course. It screens human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2 allotype from genomic DNA samples using a rapid and single-tube PCR technique, yielding definitive typing result without conventional post-amplification step like probing or Sanger sequencing. This laboratory exercise offers the undergraduate medical students an opportunity to learn about current molecular biology techniques in HLA genotyping with limited effort and cost, in addition to a better understanding of concepts presented in the classroom lectures. Upon completing this experiment module, the students show statistically significant improvement in several key indexes, such as the knowledge about the mainstream HLA DNA typing techniques, awareness of the relevance of this knowledge for their future scientific research, immunogenetics-related basic laboratory skills they acquire, and interest and desire for mastering this assay (all p < .05). This easy to implement set of experiments is composed of a two-session lab module occupying eight teaching hours, and has been run successfully in our laboratory.

AB Bioinformatics is an essential discipline for biologists. It also has a reputation of being difficult for those without a strong quantitative and computer science background. At Lancaster University, we have developed modules for the integration of bioinformatics skills training into our undergraduate biology degree portfolio. This article describes those modules, situating them in the context of the accumulated quarter century of literature on bioinformatics education. The constant evolution of bioinformatics as a discipline is emphasized, drawing attention to the continual necessity to revise and upgrade those skills being taught, even at undergraduate level. Our overarching aim is to equip students both with a portfolio of skills in the currently most essential bioinformatics tools and with the confidence to continue their own bioinformatics skills development at postgraduate or professional level.

AB The ability to separate, identify, and quantify proteins from complex mixtures are key foundational methods across biochemistry teaching and research. In particular, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an important technique that is used to measure antigen concentrations in both industry and academia. There are four categories of ELISA, direct, indirect, competitive, and sandwich, each with their own applications. Sandwich ELISAs are used to determine antigen concentrations from complex mixtures of protein, such as a cell lysates, and are regularly used as medical diagnostics to diagnose illness and diseases ranging from hepatitis to celiac disease. One major problem with teaching the sandwich ELISA technique to students is the prohibitive cost due to the need to coat a 96-well plate with a capture antibody. One solution to this problem would be to significantly reduce the role of each student in the lab, but this does not adequately prepare students to perform the procedure in a research or industry lab. Instead, this laboratory exercise teaches students the procedural knowledge needed to perform a direct sandwich ELISA, but uses a simulated experience performed within a wet-lab environment. The presented scenario is the analysis of phosphorylated proteins within a synthetic signaling pathway, but because the lab uses simulated samples, it can be tailored to different topics and educational aims. The procedure is 10- to 26-fold less expensive per student to deploy than an authentic sandwich ELISA. Students in the course report that the ELISA lab significantly strengthened the connection between theory and practice. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2019.

AB In this work, we present the results of an undergrad student from the perspective of its first approach as a principal researcher in a project. In order to gain practical experience, one of the options for students that have interest in pursuing a postgraduate program corresponds to a research stay in a laboratory of their selected field conducting a project for a period of 6 months. In this particular project, a fungal sample was isolated from Parmesan cheese spoilage and its enzymatic activity evaluated. Using simple and standardized protocols, the student was capable of identifying a possible biotechnological application for the isolate by detecting and categorizing the lipolytic activity. Through microculture characterization in potato dextrose agar (PDA) the genus of the sample was determined as Penicillium and confirmed by molecular analysis of the ITS1 and ITS4 regions. In order to examine comprehensively the potential of the new isolate, the extracellular and intracellular enzymatic activities were analyzed as well as four methods of cell rupture. From these results, sonication was determined as the best technique with 211 U/L as a maximum lipolytic value. To finalize the evaluation of the sample, the student determined the optimal pH and temperature as well as the thermotolerance of the crude extract obtaining a residual activity of 13% after 60 minutes of incubation at 45 degrees C. Upon conclusion of the research we could recognize that through a direct characterization of a fungal isolate using techniques that are widely known, the student was capable of determining and value one of the most interesting capabilities fungi has to offer; enzymatic activity, and that the knowledge obtained from established protocols enables and encourages the students to correlate the source from where they were obtained with potential biotechnological applications.

AB Enzyme activators lower K-m (the Michaelis constant) and/or raise V-max (the asymptotic reaction velocity at infinite substrate concentration); conversely, inhibitors raise K-m and/or lower V-max. But what if an effector moves both K-m and V-max in the same direction? Uncompetitive inhibitors, which decrease both K-m and V-max by the same factor, are the most common example of this. A less well-known example occurs often when crowding agents are added to the buffer in order to mimic the environment commonly encountered in vivo. Crowding agents tested on different enzymes have been shown to have every conceivable effect on K-m or V-max, causing them to rise, fall, or stay the same. In this article, a mathematical analysis is presented allowing biochemists to judge whether an effector that causes K-m and V-max to both move in the same direction serves as an inhibitor, an activator, or most surprising, as both.

AB This study presents an evaluation of virtual laboratory simulation for educational use in the AP Degree Programme in Chemical and Biotechnical Science at University College Copenhagen in Denmark. The purpose was to test if, and how, virtual laboratory simulation could be applied to a practically oriented education such as the education of laboratory technicians-the aim being to motivate students and improve the education with new teaching tools. The study investigated how specific virtual lab simulation cases (Labster-cases) may stimulate motivation, study intensity, and learning among laboratory technician students. Altogether, 78 students evaluated different educational aspects of using virtual lab cases in relation to a 2-week course within gene technology. Overall, students were positive regarding the use of laboratory simulation as well as the specific cases tested. The study showed that virtual lab simulation seems to help laboratory technician students connect theory with practice and to visualize molecular processes as well as practical laboratory procedures and instrument techniques, however, it did also pose technical challenges. Furthermore, the study indicated that the use of virtual lab simulation cases can contribute to increased study activity as well as motivation. The overall conclusion of this study was that virtual lab simulation is an effective supplement to traditional teaching activities for the education of lab technicians.

AB Although virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) techniques have been used extensively in specialized laboratories, only recently did they become affordable, reaching wider consumer markets. With increased availability, it is timely to examine the roles that VR and AR may play in teaching structural biology and in experiencing complex data sets such as macromolecular structures. This guide is suitable for those teachers of structural biology who do not have a deep knowledge of information technologies. This study focuses on three questions: 1) How can teachers of structural biology produce and disseminate VR/AR-ready educational material with established and user-friendly software tools?; 2) What are the positive and negative experiences reported by test participants when performing identical learning tasks in the VR and AR environments?; and 3) How do the test participants perceive prerecorded narration during VR/AR exploration?

AB There is a growing movement to involve undergraduate students in authentic research experiences. A variety of studies have indicated the strength of this approach in developing scientific aptitude, confidence, critical thinking skills, and increasing the likelihood to become career scientists. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) foster opportunities for students to carry out authentic research at both primarily undergraduate and large research institutions. Here, we describe a novel CURE-based biochemistry laboratory course to explore the consequences of mutagenesis of non-conserved amino acid sites in the structure and function of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme and demonstrate how collaborations between institutions can facilitate real research experiences at any type of institution.

AB Metabolism involves numerous reactions and organic compounds that the student must master to understand adequately the processes involved. Part of biochemical learning should include some knowledge of the structure of biomolecules, although the acquisition of such knowledge can be time-consuming and may require significant effort from the student. In this report, we describe the "polygonal model" as a new means of graphically representing biomolecules. This model is based on the use of geometric figures such as open triangles, squares, and circles to represent hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups, respectively. The usefulness of the polygonal model was assessed by undergraduate students in a classroom activity that consisted of "transforming" molecules from Fischer models to polygonal models and vice and versa. The survey was applied to 135 undergraduate Biology and Nursing students. Students found the model easy to use and we noted that it allowed identification of students' misconceptions in basic concepts of organic chemistry, such as in stereochemistry and organic groups that could then be corrected. The students considered the polygonal model easier and faster for representing molecules than Fischer representations, without loss of information. These findings indicate that the polygonal model can facilitate the teaching of metabolism when the structures of biomolecules are discussed. Overall, the polygonal model promoted contact with chemical structures, e.g. through drawing activities, and encouraged student-student dialog, thereby facilitating biochemical learning.

AB This practical class activity was designed to introduce students to recombinant protein expression and purification. The principal goal is to shed light on basic aspects concerning recombinant protein production, in particular protein expression, chromatography methods for protein purification, and enzyme activity as a tool to evaluate purity and conformation of the recombinant product. Herein, we describe the purification of a glutathione transferase from the human parasite Echinococcus granulosus (EgGST1), the causative agent of hydatidosis. EgGST1 is expressed fused to a histidine tag and is purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Protein quantification based on direct (UV absorbance) and indirect (colorimetric) methods are used and discussed. A simple colorimetric assay is used to measure GST activity and special emphasis is put on how to use these measurements to follow protein purification yields, its enrichment and its correct folding along the purification process. EgGST1 is easily expressed with high yields, purified in absence of protease inhibitors and proved to be robust concerning enzyme activity and protein integrity on a 1 week practical activity.

AB Fluorescent proteins are commonly used in cell biology to assess where proteins are within a cell as a function of time and provide insight into intracellular protein function. However, the usefulness of a fluorescent protein depends directly on the quantum yield. The quantum yield relates the efficiency at which a fluorescent molecule converts absorbed photons into emitted photons and it is necessary to know for assessing what fluorescent protein is the most appropriate for a particular application. In this work, we have designed an upper-level, biochemistry laboratory experiment where students measure the fluorescence quantum yields of fluorescent proteins relative to a standard organic dye. Four fluorescent protein variants, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), mCitrine, and mCherry, were used, however the methods described are useful for the characterization of any fluorescent protein or could be expanded to fluorescent quantum yield measurements of organic dye molecules. The laboratory is designed as a guided inquiry project and takes two, 4 hr laboratory periods. During the first day students design the experiment by selecting the excitation wavelength, choosing the standard, and determining the concentration needed for the quantum yield experiment that takes place in the second laboratory period. Overall, this laboratory provides students with a guided inquiry learning experience and introduces concepts of fluorescence biophysics into a biochemistry laboratory curriculum.

AB The interdisciplinary nature of biochemistry courses requires students to use both chemistry and biology knowledge to understand biochemical concepts. Research that has focused on external representations in biochemistry has uncovered student difficulties in comprehending and interpreting external representations in addition to a fragmented understanding of fundamental biochemistry concepts. This project focuses on students' understanding of primary and secondary protein structure and drawings (representations) of hydrogen-bonding in alpha helices and beta sheets. Analysis demonstrated that students can recognize and identify primary protein structure concepts when given a polypeptide. However, when asked to draw alpha helices and beta sheets and explain the role of hydrogen bonding their drawings students exhibited a fragmented understanding that lacked coherence. Faculty are encouraged to have students draw molecular level representations to make their mental models more explicit, complete, and coherent. This is in contrast to recognition and identification tasks, which do not adequately probe mental models and molecular level understanding.

AB Our environment is under constant pressure and threat from various sources of pollution. Science students, in particular chemistry students, must not only be made aware of these issues, but also be taught that chemistry (and science) can provide solutions to such real-life issues. To this end, a newly developed biochemistry laboratory experiment is described that guides students to learn about the applicability of peroxidase enzymes to degrade organic dyes (as model pollutants) in simulated waste water. In addition to showing how enzymes can potentially be used for waste water remediation, various factors than can affect enzyme-based reactions such as pH, temperature, concentration of substrates/enzymes, and denaturants can also be tested. This applied biotechnology experiment was successfully implemented in an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course to enhance students' learning of environmental issues as well important biochemistry concepts. Student survey confirmed that this laboratory experiment was successful in achieving the objectives of raising environmental awareness in students and illustrating the usefulness of chemistry in solving real-life problems. This experiment can be easily adopted in an introductory biochemistry laboratory course and taught as an inquiry-guided exercise.

AB Mass spectrometry (MS) has become an important tool in studying biological systems. One application is the identification of proteins and peptides by the matching of peptide and peptide fragment masses to the sequences of proteins in protein sequence databases. Often prior protein separation of complex protein mixtures by 2D-PAGE is needed, requiring more time and expertise than instructors of large laboratory classes can devote. We have developed an experimental module for our Biochemistry Laboratory course that engages students in MS-based protein identification following protein separation by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, a technique that is usually taught in this type of course. The module is based on soybean seed storage proteins, a relatively simple mixture of proteins present in high levels in the seed, allowing the identification of the main protein bands by MS/MS and in some cases, even by peptide mass fingerprinting. Students can identify their protein bands using software available on the Internet, and are challenged to deduce post-translational modifications that have occurred upon germination. A collection of mass spectral data and tutorials that can be used as a stand-alone computer-based laboratory module were also assembled.

DT Review
DE translation; manipulatives; models; active learning strategies
AB Biological systems and living processes involve a complex interplay of biochemicals and macromolecular structures that can be challenging for undergraduate students to comprehend and, thus, misconceptions abound. Protein synthesis, or translation, is an example of a biological process for which students often hold many misconceptions. This article describes an exercise that was developed to illustrate the process of translation using simple objects to represent complex molecules. Animations, 3D physical models, computer simulations, laboratory experiments and classroom lectures are also used to reinforce the students' understanding of translation, but by focusing on the simple manipulatives in this exercise, students are better able to visualize concepts that can elude them when using the other methods. The translation exercise is described along with suggestions for background material, questions used to evaluate student comprehension and tips for using the manipulatives to identify common misconceptions.

AB A new lecture/laboratory course to offer advanced biochemical training for undergraduate and early graduate students has been developed in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. This unique course offers students an opportunity to work hands-on with modern instrumentation not normally found in a predominately undergraduate institution, and to complete an entire research project in a realistic timeframe via a time-intensive curriculum as a special summer session. The course content gives a strong background in protein structure/chemistry, purification principles, protocol development, optimization strategies, use and programming of an automated chromatography instrument, and characterization strategies with an emphasis on X-ray crystallography. The laboratory portion offers students the chance to purify a protein (human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase) from start to finish, program and use an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography instrument, and to grow and analyze their own protein crystals using their purified protein. This innovative laboratory experience gives the participating students the opportunity to complete a miniresearch project in real time and enhances their overall understanding of important biochemical research techniques and the instrumentation involved, fostering a better understanding of the research process all within a classroom setting. Evaluations and feedback concerning this course indicated a positive learning environment, a retention of knowledge and skills, a belief that the skill set learned continues to be useful in current endeavors, and a sense of accomplishment in the completion of an actual research project within the confines of a class setting.

AB As computational modeling plays an increasingly central role in biochemical research, it is important to provide students with exposure to common modeling methods in their undergraduate curriculum. This article describes a series of computer labs designed to introduce undergraduate students to energy minimization, molecular dynamics simulations, and homology modeling. These labs were created as part of a one-semester course on the molecular modeling of biochemical systems. Students who completed these activities felt that they were an effective component of the course, reporting improved comfort with the conceptual background and practical implementation of the computational methods. Although created as a component of a larger course, these activities could be readily adapted for a variety of other educational contexts. As well, all of these labs utilize software that is freely available in an academic environment and can be run on fairly common computer hardware, making them accessible to teaching environments without extensive computational resources.

AB In an academic semester, living in social isolation and under restrictions of the pandemic, we organized weekly multidisciplinary seminars from a postgraduate course program in Curitiba, Southern Brazil, integrating students from different regions of Brazil and South America. Outstanding researchers from Brazil, Germany, France, Argentina, Mexico, Portugal, England, and United States' institutions gave seminars on chronic and infectious diseases with immunological, pharmacological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology point of views. The meetings were longer than traditional seminars, containing a part with scientific debate and other with a humanization or deconstruction of the researcher including trajectory, hobbies, scientific, and social thoughts. To facilitate learning and conceptualization, the seminars were available through YouTube and we applied weekly questionnaires to be answered rescuing scientific and motivational topics to give companionship and support to the students in pandemic times. Here, we are defending the creation of permanent platforms for scientific diffusion, with higher accessibility, connecting centers of different levels and giving academic excellence and opportunities for young researchers. Feedback received from participants indicates that this seminar structure can increase confidence and improve their perception of scientific processes and inspire researchers with development trajectories. We have discussed multidisciplinarity, scientific excellence, regional isolation and economic inequality, integration, humanization, and the value of science in society.

ID EXPRESSION
AB This article reports a session from the virtual international 2021 IUBMB/ASBMB workshop, "Teaching Science on Big Data." The awareness of using publicly available research data sets for undergraduate training is low in certain parts of the world. Final year projects always revolve around wet-lab based projects. The challenges occur during COVID-19 pandemic when it forces full lockdown to the nation, but at the same time faculty members need to provide consistent training to the students and projects to work with. We aim to identify supervisors in the faculty that are ready to convert their proposed project from wet-lab to an online-based project. As coordinators of the course we created an online survey to identify projects that can be converted into dry-lab/online projects. Our surveys identified only 32.5% projects implemented dry-lab/online based projects. Most academicians described that they are not ready or familiar to apply changes for their research design. With the unknown future of the world living with COVID-19 and directional changes of life science research toward big data driven research indeed we should be ready to adopt such changes. Awareness on reusing public data sets as tools for research should be provided to strengthen undergraduate training. Life science undergraduates should be exposed to reusing public data sets as these materials are readily available case studies that allow in depth exploration to answer specific research questions. Members of the faculty should take part to pave the way for them, ensuring that they understand that life science research revolves around a multidisciplinary field.

AB Biochemistry is a data-heavy discipline, yet teaching students to work with large datasets is absent from many undergraduate Biochemistry programs. Ensuring that future generations of students arevbv confident in tackling problems using big data first requires that educators become comfortable teaching big data skills. The activity described herein introduces educators to working with big data and a framework for generating sequence similarity networks using JupyterLab and Python. This article reports a session from the virtual international 2021 IUBMB/ASBMB workshop, "Teaching Science with Big Data."

AB Infrared (IR) spectra of biologically derived materials display distinct absorption bands correlating to individual macromolecules: protein, polysaccharide, lipid, and nucleic acids. A series of experiments aimed at teaching qualitative bioorganic spectroscopy using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (IR) with biological polymers as samples is proposed. Labs targeting 1st and 4th year undergraduate students at St. Francis College are being developed. During 2014 2017, an integrated biology/chemistry exercise featuring elementary spectroscopy as an addition to an existing lab on light microscopy was administered to three sections of a 1st year general biology course. Students were taught the concept of a spectral fingerprint and to identify carbohydrate and protein based materials by looking for key vibrational bands. The success of that effort as determined by the results of an assessment quiz became the motivation for developing an advanced 4th year exercise involving four macromolecules. In a trial lab (Spring 2019) students gathered reference spectra from materials homogeneous in a single biopolymer followed by spectra of whole tissues which they were expected to fully characterize. Assessment data suggest that 1st year students benefited most from the experience. A detailed discussion of reference and sample spectra (as obtained by students) and relevant bond vibrations along with suggestions for instructors are presented.

AB The CRISPR/Cas9 system opens new horizons (M. Adli, Nat Commun, 2018) regarding genetic modifications of living organisms but also as an in vitro tool in laboratory protocols. Therefore, it boosts possibilities in research and future medical treatments. As the controversial claim of genomically edited babies by He Jiankui (Cyranoski D., Nature, 2019) demonstrates, the new gene editing potentials entail ethical discussions. A public or social discussion presupposes not only a theoretical knowledge or understanding of the system, but also profits from direct laboratory experiences showing how easy these techniques can be applied. Introducing numerous students and classes into these emerging techniques in a modern biology classroom depends on a suitable course concept, which fits legal and organizational requirements at the same time. Therefore, we implemented an appropriate hands-on laboratory course for senior high-school students, lasting just 4.5 h. Particularly with regard to European regulations concerning the handling of genetically modified organisms, the constructs and protocols avoid the transfer of Cas9 DNA. This normally mandatory transfer was replaced by in vitro gene-editing. This leads to Cas9 induced gene knock-outs due to frame shifts and/or the excision of DNA fragments in common Escherichia coli (E. coli) plasmids, such as pUC19. This gene knock-out concept covers various steps: In vitro plasmid editing with Cas9, ligation and transformation of E. coli cells with the modified plasmid DNA and finally the spread plating of transformed E. coli cells in order to analyze colonies after overnight incubation. The successful excision of DNA fragments by in vitro Cas9 treatment was determined by subsequent gel electrophoresis.

ID GENES
AB Relative quantification is a popular analysis in gene expression studies using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). However, the calculation steps using the major algorithms for this analysis are rather complicated. In this study, we developed an easy-to-use spreadsheet-based method for relative quantification. The inputs from end-users are the efficiencies of both target and reference genes and the C-q values of those genes from cases and controls. This method performed normalization (with one or more reference genes), calculation of fold change of gene expression, and statistical analysis to analyze the difference between the groups in a step-by-step manner, which would allow the end-users to understand how the analysis arrived at the conclusion. Four previously published data sets with different experimental designs were used as examples. The calculated results were concordant with the results computed by the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) 2009, a popular tool for relative quantification. Altogether, our method, which offers easy-to-understand calculation steps and does not require specialized instruments, software, or expertise to operate, would be a useful tool for students, educators, and scientists in the field of molecular biology.

AB The flipped classroom is a relatively new active learning pedagogical intervention, gaining popularity as a blended learning methodology. The flipped classroom comprises two distinct parts, directed learning carried out at the student's own pace away from the classroom and an interactive, class-based activity encouraging problem-solving and experiential learning. This research presents a 1-year study to measure student performance and perception toward a flipped classroom approach to teaching core biochemical calculations to first-year undergraduate biochemistry and genetics students. A post-task questionnaire showed an overall positive student perception with an associated significant improvement in the end of module summative assessment. These results suggest that this teaching approach offers some advantages over more traditional teaching pedagogies.

AB Graduate student and postdoctoral teaching assistants receive highly variable preparation for instructional methods because providing such training is often expensive. Therefore, we conducted an intensive, pedagogical boot camp followed by classroom observations, structured professional development discussions about leveraging the experience on the job market, individual exit interviews, and a letter of recommendation. Our data show the participants implemented new pedagogical techniques in their classrooms, showed increased self-efficacy, and reported appreciation for the training experience. Using a clustering analysis of instructional methods, most participants' classrooms were characterized as peer-led collaborative work as opposed to more traditional instructor-led pedagogies. We believe that this low-cost, prefaculty training leads to demonstrable short-term outcomes and is a viable option for institutions with limited resources or personnel.

AB The standardized residency training in China is continuous medical education for postgraduates, which is designed to master basic knowledge, theory, and clinical skills. Case-based discussion (CBD) is one of the main formative curricula used in standardized residency training. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a novel CBD curriculum on residents' participation, satisfaction, and confidence in clinical skills. This was a prospective study that included 28 internal medicine residents. The traditional CBD contents were adjusted. The innovative approach let residents at different stages prepare and organize the CBD cases by themselves according to different levels of complexity. The surveys were designed to measure conference occurrence and residents' attendance, participation, and satisfaction, as well as their confidence in their clinical skills. Faculty could further engage the residents at any point to deepen the discussion and learning. The surveys indicated that the residents had a high satisfaction rate with the novel-staged CBD teaching method. Our curriculum improved conference occurrence, attendance, and participation; increased residents' self-report of participation in learning; and raised their confidence in their clinical skills, so the CBD was well received by residents and faculty preceptors. In addition, this study demonstrated that the staged CBD increased the knowledge and evidence usage of internal medicine residents. We expect wider application of this kind of CBD in clinical practice, medical education, residency training, and patient education in the future.

AB This article examines student engagement in an inquiry-based learning activity, planned to provide students with elements in the social, epistemic, and conceptual dimensions related to the scientific practice in immunology. The activity was applied to 39 groups of students enrolled in immunology or biochemistry courses in a public university in Brazil. Students performed data-collection through the execution of an in vitro assay. We analyzed how students represent data and use them to support their claims in their written constructs. To clarify which are the productive epistemologies in students' reports, we developed a framework for epistemic practice analysis. Our findings point to a pattern of several epistemic practice categories in their written text, mostly related to the particular contingences of data analysis, rather than to theoretical concepts. In addition, we observed that students performed literary inscriptions to represent their data; however, they tended not to cite all data obtained in their written texts. These results suggest that immunology education strategies should provide students with approaches that explore the role of data representation in the scientific text rhetoric.

AB The laboratory exercise described here aims to provide a relevant context for learning basic DNA techniques in an introductory animal science course at tertiary level. In two 4-hr laboratory sessions, students assess the suitability of bulls for inclusion in a gene-assisted selection program for A2 beta-casein by genotyping commercial bull sperm. Sperm cells are lysed to extract the genomic DNA, and PCR with primers for the beta-casein gene is performed. Using the principle of amplification-created restriction sites, restriction digestion with TaqI can be used to distinguish between the A1 allele and the A2 allele of the gene. Cut PCR amplicons are separated by gel electrophoresis to evaluate the genotype of each bull. Students then write a diagnostic report with accompanying letter to their fictional client, explaining the DNA test, and interpreting the results.

AB In this study, a 'biotechnology literacy test' was developed to determine the biotechnology literacy of prospective science teachers, and its validity and reliability were determined. For this purpose, 42 items were prepared by considering Bybee's scientific literacy classifications (nominal, functional, procedural, and multidimensional). The experts were asked to rate each item for content validity. As a result of the experts' evaluations, the content validity of the test was confirmed. The draft test was applied to 494 science prospective teachers. Difficulty and discrimination coefficients of items within the test were calculated to provide evidence of construct validity. It was decided to exclude 13 items as a result of item analysis. It can be said that that the test was difficult (p = 0.40) and discriminative (D = 0.41) at medium level. Finally, a valid and reliable "biotechnology literacy test" consisting of 25 multiple-choice items each with five choices was developed in this research.

AB Visualizations are useful tools for helping students to understand chemistry concepts at the particulate level. A classroom activity was developed based on learning theory and evidence-based practices, combining protein visualization with thermodynamic parameters from differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) data analysis. Coding of student responses showed that many students were able to establish the desired connections among protein structure, thermodynamic parameters, and experimental data analysis, while a few did not recognize all the differences between the folded and unfolded forms of the protein. The activity elicits student prior knowledge through the pre-class activity, has the students examine the interactions within a protein molecule through the PyMOL activity, introduces DSF analysis using the learning cycle through the Guided Inquiry activity, and tests student learning through the post-class activity. Upon completing the activity, the majority of students successfully met the learning goals. (c) 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(1):67-75, 2018.

AB Enzyme kinetics is an essential topic in undergraduate Biochemistry courses. A laboratory work that covers the principal basic concepts of enzyme kinetics in steady state is presented. The alkaline phosphatase catalyzed reaction of phenyl-phosphate hydrolysis was studied as a model. The laboratory experience was designed to reinforce the concepts of initial velocity dependence on substrate and enzyme concentration, and to highlight the importance of the accurate determination of initial reaction rate. The laboratory work consists in two parts, in which students first determine the enzyme concentration and the time to be used in the following session to obtain the kinetic parameters (K-M and V-max) by non-lineal fitting of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the initial velocity dependence with substrate concentration results. The experimental methodology is robust, the cost per student is low and the equipment and reagents used are of easy access.

AB The rapid development and popularization of smart phones and mobile internet has created a new social lifestyle, and correspondingly prompts the transformation of network teaching from desktop computer to mobile teaching. This article has compared the pros and cons of Tsinghua Education Online and WeChat official account (WOA) in fulfilling teaching functions. We also described the construction of WOA platform with the example of WOA-based teaching in biochemistry and molecular biology. The platform can establish nearly 75 menu catalogs and 2,250 items, which is capable for the publication of any types of teaching materials and information. The WOA teaching is well accepted and becomes popular in China due to the free, interactive, attractive, adaptable, portable, sustainable, and more participatory teaching styles.

AB A one semester undergraduate biochemistry laboratory experience is described for an understanding of recombinant technology from gene cloning to protein characterization. An integrated experimental design includes three sequential modules: molecular cloning, protein expression and purification, and protein analysis and characterization. Students perform the tasks of cloning, expression, purification, analysis, and characterization of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor. SLAC is an extremely robust well-characterized protein/enzyme, which serves as an ideal model for undergraduate teaching laboratories. Also, this goal-oriented research-like approach helps students to unite the concepts of biochemistry and molecular biology and appreciate the utility of the methods more effectively. A student assessment before and after the course demonstrated an overall increase in learning and enthusiasm on the topic of modern protein chemistry.

AB Biochemistry and cellular biology courses for medical students at Tongji University include the assessment that provides students with feedback to enhance their learning, which is a type of formative assessment. However, frequent instant feedback and guidance for students is often absent or inconsistently included in the teaching process. WeChat, the most popular Chinese social media, was introduced in biochemistry and cellular biology course. A WeChat official account (OA) was set up as an instant interactive platform. Over a period of two semesters, OA sent 73 push notifications. The components included course notices, preclass thought questions, after-class study materials, answer questions and feedback, simulation exercises, teacher-student interaction, and research progress relevant to the course. WeChat OA served as an active-learning teaching tool, provided more frequent feedback and guidance to students, and facilitated better student-centered communication in the teaching process. Using the WeChat OA in medical teaching emphasized interactive, interoperable, effective, engaging, adaptable, and more participatory teaching styles. As a new platform, WeChat OA was free, Internet-reliant, and easily managed. Using this new medium as a communication tool accelerated further advancement of instant feedback and improvement in teaching activities. Notifications and interactive feedback via the mobile social medium WeChat OA anytime and anywhere facilitated a student-centered teaching mode. Use of WeChat OA significantly increased the proportion of students interactively participating and resulted in a high degree of student satisfaction.

AB With the internationalization of medical education in China, the importance of international students' education in medical schools is also increasing. Except foreign students majoring in Chinese language, English Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBSS) students are the largest group of international students. Based on problems in the teaching process for experimental biochemistry, we designed teaching models adapted to the background of international students and strengthened teachers' teaching ability at Taishan Medical University. Several approaches were used in combination to promote teaching effects and increase the benefit of teaching to teachers. The primary data showed an increased passion for basic medical biochemistry and an improved theoretical background for MBSS students, which will be helpful for their later clinical medicine studies.

AB The use of external representations (ERs) to introduce concepts in undergraduate biology has become increasingly common. Two of the most prevalent are static images and dynamic animations. While previous studies comparing static images and dynamic animations have resulted in somewhat conflicting findings in regards to learning outcomes, the benefits of each have been shown individually. Using ERs developed by the Virtual Cell Animation project, we aim to further investigate student learning using different ERs as part of an introductory biology lecture. We focus our study on the topic of photosynthesis as reports have noted that students struggle with a number of basic photosynthesis concepts. Students (n=167) in ten sections of introductory biology laboratory were introduced to photosynthesis concepts by instructional lectures differing only in the format of the embedded ERs. Normalized gain scores were calculated, showing that students who learned with dynamic animations outperformed students who learned from static images on the posttest. The results of this study provide possible instructional guidelines for those delivering photosynthesis instruction in the introductory biology classroom.

AB Hematology is difficult for students to learn. A beneficial education method for hematology clerkship training is required to help students develop clinical skills. Foreign medical students often encounter communication issues in China. To address this issue, Chinese post-graduates from our institute are willing to assist with educating foreign students. Therefore, we propose a mixed team-based learning method (MTBL) which might overcome communication problems in hematology clerkship. Twenty-two foreign medical Students attended a 2-week hematology clerkship in Fujian Medical University Union Hospital. Twenty-one foreign African medical students were assigned randomly into two groups. Fourteen foreign African medical students were assigned to MTBL group. Each MTBL team included two foreign African medical students and one Chinese post-graduate. Seven foreign African medical students were assigned to lecture-based learning method (LBL) group, which had a foreign medical classmate from Hong Kong or Chinese intern volunteers to serve as translators. The practice test scores of MTBL were significantly higher than LBL group (p < 0.05). The MTBL group had increased motivation to prepare before class, an engaged classroom atmosphere, and an improvement in their understanding of difficult topics. Interestingly, the Chinese postgraduates also benefited from this setting, as they found that this interaction improved their communication in the English language. The mixed team-based learning method overcomes communication problems in hematology clerkship. Foreign medical students and Chinese post-graduates alike can benefit from MTBL.

AB A Citizen Science approach was implemented in the laboratory practices of Genetics at the University of Oviedo, related with the engaging topic of Food Control. Real samples of food products consumed by students at home (students as samplers) were employed as teaching material in three different courses of Genetics during the academic year 2014-2015: Experimental Methods in Food Production (MBTA) (Master level), and Applied Molecular Biology (BMA) and Conservation Genetics and Breeding (COMGE) (Bachelor/Degree level). Molecular genetics based on PCR amplification of DNA markers was employed for species identification of 22 seafood products in COMGE and MBTA, and for detection of genetically modified (GM) maize from nine products in BMA. In total six seafood products incorrectly labeled (27%), and two undeclared GM maize (22%) were found. A postLaboratory survey was applied for assessing the efficacy of the approach for improving motivation in the Laboratory Practices of Genetics. Results confirmed that students that worked on their own samples from local markets were significantly more motivated and better evaluated their Genetic laboratory practices than control students (chi(2) = 12.11 p=0.033). Our results suggest that citizen science approaches could not be only useful for improving teaching of Genetics in universities but also to incorporate students and citizens as active agents in food control.

AB In this article, we describe a basic practical laboratory designed for fifth-year undergraduate students of Microbiology as part of the Epidemiology course. This practice provides the students with the tools for molecular epidemiological analysis of pathogenic microorganisms using a rapid and simple PCR technique. The aim of this work was to assay RAPD-PCR technique in order to infer possible epidemiological relationships. The activity gives students an appreciation of the value of applying a simple molecular biological method as RAPD-PCR to a discipline-specific question. It comprises a three-session laboratory module to genetically assay DNAs from strains isolated from a food outbreak.

AB Interdisciplinary exploration is vital to education in the 21st century. This manuscript outlines an innovative laboratory-based teaching method that combines elements of biochemistry/molecular biology, kinesiology/health science, computer science, and manufacturing engineering to give students the ability to better conceptualize complex biological systems. Here, we utilize technology available at most universities to print three-dimensional (3D) scale models of actual human muscle cells (myofibers) out of bioplastic materials. The same methodological approach could be applied to nearly any cell type or molecular structure. This advancement is significant because historically, two-dimensional (2D) myocellular images have proven insufficient for detailed analysis of organelle organization and morphology. 3D imaging fills this void by providing accurate and quantifiable myofiber structural data. Manipulating tangible 3D models combats 2D limitation and gives students new perspectives and alternative learning experiences that may assist their understanding. This approach also exposes learners to 1) human muscle cell extraction and isolation, 2) targeted fluorescence labeling, 3) confocal microscopy, 4) image processing (via open-source software), and 5) 3D printing bioplastic scale-models (3500 larger than the actual cells). Creating these physical models may further student's interest in the invisible world of molecular and cellular biology. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary laboratory project gives instructors of all biological disciplines a new teaching tool to foster integrative thinking.

ID LABORATORY EXPERIMENT; DNA; BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Polymerase chain reaction and restriction endonuclease digest are important techniques that should be included in all Biochemistry and Molecular Biology laboratory curriculums. These techniques are frequently taught at an advanced level, requiring many hours of student and faculty time. Here we present two inquiry-based experiments that are designed for introductory laboratory courses and combine both techniques. In both approaches, students must determine the identity of an unknown DNA sequence, either a gene sequence or a primer sequence, based on a combination of PCR product size and restriction digest pattern. The experimental design is flexible, and can be adapted based on available instructor preparation time and resources, and both approaches can accommodate large numbers of students. We implemented these experiments in our courses with a combined total of 584 students and have an 85% success rate. Overall, students demonstrated an increase in their understanding of the experimental topics, ability to interpret the resulting data, and proficiency in general laboratory skills.

ID PROTEINS
AB Since 2010, second-year undergraduate students of an eight-year training program leading to a Doctor of Medicine degree or Doctor of Philosophy degree in Peking University Health Science Center (PKUHSC) have been required to enter the "Innovative talent training project." During that time, the students joined a research lab and participated in some original research work. There is a critical educational need to prepare these students for the increasing accessibility of research experience. The redesigned experimental curriculum of biochemistry and molecular biology was developed to fulfill such a requirement, which keeps two original biochemistry experiments (Gel filtration and Enzyme kinetics) and adds a new two-experiment component called "Analysis of antitumor drug induced apoptosis." The additional component, also known as the "project-oriented experiment" or the "comprehensive experiment," consists of Western blotting and a DNA laddering assay to assess the effects of etoposide (VP16) on the apoptosis signaling pathways. This reformed laboratory teaching system aims to enhance the participating students overall understanding of important biological research techniques and the instrumentation involved, and to foster a better understanding of the research process all within a classroom setting. Student feedback indicated that the updated curriculum helped them improve their operational and self-learning capability, and helped to increase their understanding of theoretical knowledge and actual research processes, which laid the groundwork for their future research work.

AB Undergraduates having their first research experience frequently have little idea of what to expect. Institutions offering summer research experiences attempt to address this issue through programs that introduce students to the process and culture of science. However, didactic approaches frequently bore students who prefer more interactive sessions. We describe a "Pass-the-Problem" case study approach that engages groups of students in useful discussions about the research environment they are entering. The cases presented here include keeping a thorough laboratory notebook, balancing laboratory and personal time demands, anxiety about formal presentations, unexpected federal regulatory inspection, working in a lab with limited funds, being used as a technician rather than a researcher, frustration with failed experiments, effects of promotion and tenure on laboratory atmosphere, the importance of reading the research literature, and questioning a career in science. These cases alert students to different situations they might encounter and stimulate discussion about how to deal with them. (C) 2015 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB The Division of Graduate Medical Sciences at the Boston University School of Medicine houses numerous dynamic graduate programs. Doctoral students began their studies with laboratory rotations and classroom training in a variety of fundamental disciplines. Importantly, with 15 unique pathways of admission to these doctoral programs, there were also 15 unique curricula. Departments and programs offered courses independently, and students participated in curricula that were overlapping combinations of these courses. This system created curricula that were not coordinated and that had redundant course content as well as content gaps. A partnership of key stakeholders began a curriculum reform process to completely restructure doctoral education at the Boston University School of Medicine. The key pedagogical goals, objectives, and elements designed into the new curriculum through this reform process created a curriculum designed to foster the interdisciplinary thinking that students are ultimately asked to utilize in their research endeavors. We implemented comprehensive student and peer evaluation of the new Foundations in Biomedical Sciences integrated curriculum to assess the new curriculum. Furthermore, we detail how this process served as a gateway toward creating a more fully integrated graduate experience, under the umbrella of the Program in Biomedical Sciences.

AB DockoMatic 2.0 is a powerful open source software program (downloadable from ) that allows users to utilize a readily accessible computational tool to explore biomolecules and their interactions. This manuscript describes a practical tutorial for use in the undergraduate curriculum that introduces students to macromolecular structure creation, ligand binding calculations, and visualization of docking results. A student procedure is provided that illustrates the use of DockoMatic to create a homology model for the amino propeptide region (223 amino acids with two disulfide bonds) of collagen 1 (XI), followed by molecular docking of the commercial drug Arixtra((R)) to the homology model of 1 (XI), and finally, analysis of the results of the docking experiment. The activities and Supporting Information described are intended to educate students in the use of computational tools to create and investigate homology models for other systems of interest and to train students to perform and analyze molecular docking studies. The tutorial also serves as a foundation for investigators seeking to explore the viability of using computational biochemistry to study their receptor-ligand binding motifs.

AB This study includes the results of a 2-day education project titled Molecular Biology Laboratory Summer School, MoBiLYO. The project was held at a University Research Center by scientists from Department of Pharmacology and graduate students. The project was composed of introductory lectures, model construction, DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and gel electrophoresis. The participants were 13-year-old eighth-graders attending primary schools affiliated with Ministry of National Education in urban and rural areas of Izmir, Turkey. The purpose of this study was to introduce basic molecular biology concepts through individually performed experiments such as PCR and gel electrophoresis integrated with creative drama. The students were assessed at the beginning and the end of each project day via mini-tests, experimental and presentation skills evaluation forms. Data showed that students' knowledge about DNA structure and basic molecular biology techniques significantly increased. On the basis of experimental and presentational skills, there was no significant difference between kids from urban and rural schools or between public and boarding public schools, whereas the average score of girls was significantly higher than that of boys. In conclusion, individually performed experiments integrated with creative drama significantly increased students' perception of complex experimental procedures on basic molecular biology concepts. Data suggests that integration of these concepts into the science and technology curriculum of Turkish primary education may support the recruitment of future scientists who can handle rapidly developing genomic techniques that will affect our everyday life.

TI Using an ePortfolio System as an Electronic Laboratory Notebook in

DE electronic laboratory notebook; ELN; ePortfolio; undergraduate practical
   class
AB Despite many apparent advantages, including security, back-up, remote access, workflow, and data management, the use of electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) in the modern research laboratory is still developing. This presents a challenge to instructors who want to give undergraduate students an introduction to the kinds of data curation and notebook keeping skills that will inevitably be required as ELNs penetrate normal laboratory practice. An additional problem for the teacher is that ELNs do not generally have student-administrative functions and are prohibitively expensive. In this report, we describe the use and impact of an ePortfolio system as a surrogate ELN. Introduction of the system led to several pedagogic outcomes, namely: increased preparedness of students for class, encouragement of creativity and reflection with respect to experimental methods, greatly enhanced engagement between students and tutors, and it gave instructors the ability to scrutinize original data files and monitor student-tutor feedback cycles. However, implementation led to a disruption of tutor workloads and incurred new levels of accountability that threatened to undermine the initiative. Through course evaluations and other reflective processes, we reached an appreciation of how an ELN should be introduced into practical class teaching so that it not only becomes an appropriate aid for teaching the laboratory experience, but also becomes a life-long resource for students.

AB SoTL stands for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. The acronym, said sottle or soteall, describes research that involves rigorous examination of teaching and learning by faculty who are actively involved in the educational process. The number of natural-science faculty engaged in SoTL is increasing, and their important work has broad implications for the measurement and improvement of college teaching and learning outcomes. The data show, however, that many faculty who conduct SoTL projects in science departments begin their education research careers with no training in SoTL research methodologies, and find they are working alone, with few colleagues who can nurture (or even understand) their efforts. In this article we provide a guide intended to help natural-science faculty initiate SoTL projects while they negotiate the mechanics and politics of developing and maintaining a SoTL research program in a science department.

AB As biochemists, one of our most captivating teaching tools is the use of molecular visualization. It is a compelling medium that can be used to communicate structural information much more effectively with interactive animations than with static figures. We have conducted a survey to begin a systematic evaluation of the current classroom usage of molecular visualization. Participants (n = 116) were asked to complete 11 multiple choice and 3 open ended questions. To provide more depth to these results, interviews were conducted with 12 of the participants. Many common themes arose in the survey and the interviews: a shared passion for the use of molecular visualization in teaching, broad diversity in software preference, the lack of uniform standards for assessment, a desire for more quality resources, and the challenge of enabling students to incorporate visualization in their learning. The majority of respondents had used molecular visualization for more than 5 years and mentioned 32 different visualization tools used, with Jmol and PyMOL clearly standing out as the most frequently used programs at the present time. The most common uses of molecular visualization in teaching were lecture and lab illustrations, followed by exam questions, in-class or in-laboratory exercises, and student projects, which frequently included presentations. While a minority of instructors used a grading rubric/scoring matrix for assessment of student learning with molecular visualization, many expressed a desire for common use assessment tools.

AB This article reports on conceptual difficulties related to photosynthesis and respiratory metabolism of a Plant Physiology course for undergraduate students that could hinder their better learning of metabolic processes. A survey of results obtained in this area during the last 10 academic years was performed, as well as a specific test, aimed to find out prior conceptual schemes in the students. The test included only basic, general questions on plant metabolism, and was passed on the first day of the course. Scores obtained by different groups of students were compared. Survey of students' performance in previous years shows that questions on plant metabolism result in significantly lower number of correct answers than for the rest of questions, despite reiteration of its teaching in prior educational levels. Some areas such as respiration or light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, as well as concepts and terminology related to electrochemistry, seem to be particularly difficult. The specific test also shows differences among the different groups of students included in this investigation. Our results point out that reiteration of a particular subject in the curricula at different educational levels does not result in a coherent enough conceptual scheme in the students. To help students in this task, it is recommended to teach the general processes also in advanced courses in which these processes are taught in great detail. In this way, settlement of the appropriate conceptual scheme may be reinforced.

AB Potential benefits of incorporating music into science and math curricula include enhanced recall of information, counteraction of perceptions that the material is dull or impenetrable, and opportunities for active student engagement and creativity. To help instructors and others find songs suited to their needs, I created the Math And Science Song Information, Viewable Everywhere database in March of 2004. Recently rebranded as the SingAboutScience.org database, it now covers >5,500 songs varying widely in topic and grade level. Website visitors may search the database using such criteria as keywords from lyrics, performer/songwriter names, and age ranges targeted by songs. Changes in the database's contents over the past 7 years suggest that the online availability of educational songs has increased greatly during this period. College biochemistry and molecular biology instructors can use the database to find songs covering core concepts for majors and nonmajors as well as relevant material from related subjects, such as physics and mathematics. In offering teachers and students a menu of existing scientific songs, the database may inspire some of them to create additional content-rich music.

AB Protein engineering is a powerful tool, which correlates protein structure with specific functions, both in applied biotechnology and in basic research. Here, we present a practical teaching course for engineering the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria by a random mutagenesis strategy using error-prone polymerase chain reaction. Screening of bacterial colonies transformed with random mutant libraries identified GFP variants with increased fluorescence yields. Mapping the three-dimensional structure of these mutants demonstrated how alterations in structural features such as the environment around the fluorophore and properties of the protein surface can influence functional properties such as the intensity of fluorescence and protein solubility.

AB We incorporated a bioinformatics component into the freshman biology course that allows students to explore cystic fibrosis (CF), a common genetic disorder, using bioinformatics tools and skills. Students learn about CF through searching genetic databases, analyzing genetic sequences, and observing the three-dimentional structures of proteins using a number of computational tools. We also use this opportunity to discuss the genetic, molecular, biochemical, and physiological aspects of CF, in an effort to help students appreciate the interrelationships among concepts and topics in biology within a real-world context. This component provides the freshman students at Savannah State University an early exposure to bioinformatics and prepares them for the upper level courses in this area. It also facilitates meaningful and in-depth learning by linking biological concepts and processes through a case study.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The Strasbourg University PhD school in Life and Health Sciences launched an initiative called "OpenLAB." This project was developed in an effort to help high school teenagers understand theoretical and abstract concepts in genetics. A second objective of this program is to help students in defining their future orientation and to attract them to biology. The general idea is a 2-hour PCR-based practical that is developed around a fictitious criminal investigation. The practical is taught by PhD graduate students who bring all the required reagents and modern equipment into the classroom. Running the PCR provides free time dedicated to discussions with students about their future plans after the high school diploma. A specific website and a powerpoint presentation were developed to provide appropriate scientific information. Starting on a modest scale in Strasbourg in December 2008, "OpenLAB" was rapidly and well received all around, visiting 53 classes spread over a 200 km area in Alsace until May 2009. It permitted interactions with almost one thousand students in their last year of high school, with the prospect to visit 20% more classes this school year. Our experience, along with feedback from students and their teachers, suggests that it is possible to reach out to many students and have a strong impact with a rather limited budget.
