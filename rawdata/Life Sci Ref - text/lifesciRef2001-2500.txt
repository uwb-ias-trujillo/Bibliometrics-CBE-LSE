TI Selected omissions and capstone presentations: a new approach to
   student-centered integrative physiology education
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE capstone; integration; selected omissions
AB Here, we describe a pedagogical approach that combines didactics with active learning to facilitate integration across physiological systems in a team-taught, graduate-level physiology course. We covered the major physiological systems, with each system preceded by an overview of its evolution/ontogeny to provide a broader perspective. Lectures provided a framework for integration by giving examples of how each system interacted with systems that preceded and followed. In lieu of a final exam, the course culminated in capstone presentations by small groups to promote student-centered learning of integrative physiology. At the beginning of the semester, students were assigned to groups; each group chose from predetermined topics. This allowed them to accumulate information throughout the semester and required them to attend to lecture content to assess how the material applied to their topic, thereby facilitating learning and retention. Faculty were deliberate in choosing material that was presented in each system, and material that was strategically omitted, establishing "gaps" that students filled in their capstone presentations. The final week was dedicated to student preparation for their presentations, which promoted peer-to-peer teaching and problem solving by the group, assisted by faculty as necessary. Capstone presentations demonstrated students' mastery of basic physiological principles and their ability to integrate among physiological systems, and they rated capstone presentations highly in helping with integration and critical thinking. Thus students showed a better understanding of systems physiology and the importance of integration across systems in normal function and in responding to homeostatic challenges.

TI Electrify your class with a simple battery: battery demonstration of
   electrocardiogram vectors
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE action potential; electrocardiogram; vectors
AB William Arthur Ward stated, "The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires." Discovery experimentation is an inductive method that demonstrates and inspires by creating an interest in determining the underlining basis of a phenomenon. This experiential approach also fosters motivation and enhances learning. Starting with what the student knows augments this approach. By starting with what the student already knows, the student can consciously and explicitly link the subsequent new information with previous knowledge. Accordingly, we used a simple battery as an analogy for electrocardiogram vectors to introduce the theoretical physics of how the heart produces voltages that are detectable at the body surface. This extraordinarily complex physics was approached in a straightforward and inexpensive way while still providing an understanding of the fundamental concepts developed by Willem Einthoven in 1895.

AB Basic science educators are not trained as clinicians, yet are expected to adjust their content to mesh appropriately with its clinical application. While achievable, this is a challenge that requires intentional effort on the part of the basic science educators. A practical solution to facilitate curricular integration is to create experiential opportunities for basic scientists to observe the clinical application of their content and to pair these initiatives with training in effective medical education practices.

AB Bioscience is a foundational unit (subject) of undergraduate allied health degree programs, providing students the scientific basis underpinning their clinical practice. However, despite its significance. bioscience is a difficult academic hurdle for many students to master. The introduction of active learning strategies, including small team-based guided-inquiry learning approaches, has been shown to significantly reduce this hurdle and improve assessment outcomes for the learner. Guided team-based activities can aid in this approach by also building broader skills and capabilities, like teamwork and communication, as well as subject-specific knowledge and skills, thereby positively influencing student assessment outcomes. This paper details the redesign and evaluation of two first-year Bioscience for Paramedics units with the introduction of guided-inquiry learning, as well as other active learning strategies. and assesses their impact on student performance. Results indicate that active learning used within a classroom and in the large lecture theater setting improved students' grades with positive student perception of their learning experience.

AB A group of teachers from Northeast Brazil developed a model of membrane potentials and action potential and tested the hypothesis that using the peer-instruction model would provide a better performance for students in reading traditional texts and lectures. The results were obtained from 357 students from 20 different courses in 9 different undergraduate programs. All students attended two 100-min theoretical lecture and, at the end of the second lecture, were asked to answer a multiple-choice question (a pretest). In the following lecture, students were divided into three groups: control, text, and model. At the end of the lecture, everyone responded to a posttest. Student performance in the pretest did not differ significantly between groups. In the comparison between the pretest and the posttest, students in the model and text groups significantly improved their performance, but there was no improvement in the control group. In the posttest, the model group presented a better performance than the control group. In the evaluation of the strategies used, 46% of the students indicated that the text would be very useful to remind them about the subject in the future, whereas 80% of those who used the model indicated that it would be very useful or extremely useful. useful. Although it was not possible to support the hypothesis conclusively, the performance model group, at least in part, was due to the use of active methodologies that constitute a differential in the teaching-learning process.

AB Many professors are interested in providing science outreach to local K-12 students, but may not have the time or resources needed to create an engaging presentation. The American Physiological Society supports outreach initiatives through programs such as the Physiology Understanding (PhUn) Week. Building on these activities, it was desired to create and assess an immersive and engaging Outreach Program in a disadvantaged K-12 student population. Three distinct modules were created on cardiovascular physiology, respiratory physiology, and oral health. All resources for these modules underwent peer review and publication, allowing other professors to easily execute their own outreach programming. The outreach modules were presented to 288 students in 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th grade classes. Implementation of the modules resulted in significant increases in student content knowledge, ranging from 32 to 57% improvement (P < 0.001, dependent t-test), with an average increase of 46%. K-12 science teachers reported that the program was at an appropriate educational level, increased students' enthusiasm for science, and increased students' exposure to science careers. Additionally, the presenters of the Outreach Program were perceived to be enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and proficient at interacting with the students. On open-response survey items, the science teachers indicated a high level of satisfaction with the program and an enthusiasm for continued collaborations. These results indicate the importance of organized and interactive science activities for the success of a new Outreach Program.

AB Acute stress responses are known to include increases in heart rate and blood pressure. as well as increases in the number of circulating immune cells, all of which are governed by the autonomic nervous system. This laboratory practical measures cardiovascular and circulating immune cell responses to a passive (cold pressor) and active (mental arithmetic) acute stress task in student participants. The results allow them to examine the different patterns of autonomic response they elicit (approximated by heart rate and blood pressure responses), and knowledge of these responses can then be used to infer the governing autonomic aspect of the increases in circulating immune cells from the results. This activity can be either adapted from teacher-led methods to inquiry, asking students to design the details of the acute stress tasks, or developed by asking students to design a follow-up experiment that could be used to provide direct evidence for their conclusions. Data collected provide a platform for teaching data analysis and interpretation, as well as critical thinking.

AB Superheroes, such as Iron Man, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Hawkeye, have appeared in numerous films, displaying their range of incredible superpowers and abilities. Therefore, it is unsurprising that many people would not only wish to attain these powers, but also to learn about scientific accessibility to these powers. Popular culture characters such as superheroes can provide a unique platform for the communication of difficult scientific concepts. In the classroom, these characters can be used to communicate learning objectives to students in an interesting, fun, and accessible manner by taking advantage of student familiarity with the characters. Hawkeye, a member of the Avengers, is one such superhero who can be utilized by educators. His powers can be attributed in part to his advanced eyesight, which has physiological aspects in common with many birds of prey. Hence, Hawkeye can instigate discussion on the physiology of the human eye, while also allowing for comparison with other species, such as birds of prey, and reflection on advancements related to genetic engineering and wearable technologies. In addition, in my experience, Hawkeye has proven to be a highly suitable popular culture character for use in scientific communication and outreach.

AB The authors began a curriculum reform project to improve the experience in a Renal Physiology course for first-year medical students. Taking into account both the variety of learning preferences among students and the benefits of student autonomy, the authors hypothesized that adding digital chalk-talk videos to lecture notes and live lectures would improve student knowledge, course satisfaction, and engagement. The authors measured performance on the renal physiology exam before (the traditional curriculum) and for 2 yr after implementation of the new curriculum. During the traditional and subsequent years, students took a Q-sort survey before and after the Renal Physiology course. Satisfaction was assessed based on ranked statements in the Q sort, as well as through qualitative analysis of student commentary. Compared with the traditional curriculum, mean scores on the renal physiology final exam were higher after implementation of the new curriculum: 65.3 vs. 74.4 (P < 0.001) with year 1 and 65.3 vs. 79.4 (P < 0.001) in the second year. After the new curriculum, students were more likely to agree with the statement, "I wish other courses were taught like this one." Qualitative analysis revealed how the video-based curriculum improved student engagement and satisfaction. Adding digital chalk-talk videos to a traditional Renal Physiology course that included active learning led to improved exam performance and high levels of student satisfaction. Other preclinical courses in medical school may benefit from such an intervention.

AB This study describes an undergraduate student laboratory activity using isolated preparations from rat gastrointestinal tissues that possess contractile profiles typically exhibited by striated and smooth muscle cells. While students are introduced to an ex vivo methodology, they can compare differences in trace experiments, twitch aspects, phasic and tonic properties, force-frequency relationships, and pharmacological responsiveness of esophageal (striated) and fundic (smooth muscle) segments. Muscle strips were subjected to electrical field stimulation (EFS) applied by platinum electrodes immersed in the physiological solution. The contractile profile of EFS responses varied between these two types of gut preparations. Atropine and tubocurarine revealed differential inhibitory influences in esophagus or fundus tissues; caffeine and procaine produced similar effects, i.e., potentiation and blockade of the EFS-induced contractile response in these tissues, respectively. Experimental results obtained during the activity helped the improvement of student learning about basic concepts previously discussed in theoretical lectures. To measure student learning with this laboratory exercise, a questionnaire was applied before and after the activity, and the number of expected correct answers, concerning the mechanisms of contraction in striated and smooth muscle, could be clearly evidenced.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an educational game that is used for teaching the mechanisms of the action potentials in cell membranes. The game was composed of pieces representing the intracellular and extracellular environments, ions, ion channels, and the Na+-K+-ATPase pump. During the game activity, the students arranged the pieces to demonstrate how the ions move through the membrane in a resting state and during an action potential, linking the ion movement with a graph of the action potential. To test the effect of the game activity on student understanding, first-year dental students were given the game to play at different times in a series of classes teaching resting membrane potential and action potentials. In all experiments, students who played the game performed better in assessments. According to 98% of the students, the game supported the learning process. The data confirm the students' perception, indicating that the educational game improved their understanding about action potentials.

AB Simulation-based integrated clinical skills sessions have great potential for use in medical curricula. Integration is central to simulation efficacy. The aim of this study was to obtain medical students' perceptions toward effectiveness of integrated clinical skills sessions by using different simulation adjuncts and to know the challenges/obstacles encountered toward the implementation of such sessions. A study was conducted to obtain anonymous feedback from male (n = 156) and female (n = 179) medical students in years 2 and 3 during the 2014-2015 academic sessions at Alfaisal University about their perceptions of the effectiveness of integrated clinical skills sessions, uses of simulation adjuncts, and obstacles encountered toward the effective implementation of such sessions. The response rate was 93.4. Factor analysis showed data being valid and reliable. Cronbach's alpha - values for effectiveness of sessions, use of simulation adjunct, and obstacles encountered were 0.97, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively. We conclude that students perceived positively the effectiveness of integrated clinical skills sessions as well as the use of simulation adjuncts, especially SPs. They suggested overcoming the obstacles and limitations of simulation. They highly valued the role of the facilitators in achieving effective sessions.

AB An active learning activity was used to engage students and enhance in-class learning of cell cycle regulation in a PharmD level integrated biological sciences course. The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness and perception of the in-class activity. After completion of a lecture on the topic of cell cycle regulation, students completed a 10-question multiple-choice quiz before and after engaging in the activity. The activity involved reading of a headline news article published by ScienceDaily.com entitled "One Gene Lost Equals One limb Regained." The name of the gene was deleted from the article and, thus, the end goal of the activity was to determine the gene of interest by the description in the story. The activity included compiling a list of all potential gene candidates before sufficient information was given to identify the gene of interest (p21). A survey was completed to determine student perceptions of the activity. Quiz scores improved by an average of 20% after the activity (40.1 +/- 1.95 vs. 59.9 +/- 2.14, P < 0.0001, n = 96). Students enjoyed the activity, found the news article interesting, and believed that the activity improved their understanding of cell cycle regulation. The majority of students agreed that the in-class activity piqued their interest for learning the subject matter and also agreed that if they understand a concept during class, they are more likely to want to study that concept outside of class. In conclusion, the activity improved in-class understanding and enhanced interest in cell cycle regulation.

ID ASSOCIATIONS; RESPONSES
AB Researchers trained in pharmacology and physiology must possess not only a comprehensive knowledge of chemistry and the nature of compounds but also a deep understanding of physiology and predict how these compounds function in a system or organism. However, graduate programs in pharmacology and physiology have increasingly begun to focus on more reductionist approaches to basic science, neglecting training in integrative/systems physiology. In response to a decline in the competency of recent pharmacology and physiology graduates, a biennial meeting, National Directors of Graduate Studies (NDOGS) in pharmacology and physiology, was conceived to address these concerns and improve the quality of graduate education. NDOGS functions as a forum for directors of pharmacology and physiology programs to exchange ideas and tackle the challenges facing graduate education. The 2015 meeting was held on the campus of the University of Cincinnati, and each day of the meeting was allocated for discussion of a broad topic. On Friday, talks were aimed at "enhancing the professional pipeline." On Saturday, the theme of "fitting training to emerging needs" tackled ways that universities can respond to the emerging needs of a changing society. Sunday morning updated graduate program directors about changes to National Institutes of Health T32 Training Grant applications and provided a forum for program directors to share their experiences and concerns. Throughout the meeting, presentations and discussions highlighted challenges and opportunities that apply broadly to PhD training in the biomedical sciences and revealed best practices to improve training and career preparation of PhD trainees.

AB Student populations are diverse such that different types of learners struggle with traditional didactic instruction. Problem-based learning has existed for several decades, but there is still controversy regarding the optimal mode of instruction to ensure success at all levels of students' past achievement. The present study addressed this problem by dividing students into the following three instructional groups for an upperlevel course in animal physiology: traditional lecture-style instruction (LI), guided problem-based instruction (GPBI), and open problem-based instruction (OPBI). Student performance was measured by three summative assessments consisting of 50% multiple-choice questions and 50% short-answer questions as well as a final overall course assessment. The present study also examined how students of different academic achievement histories performed under each instructional method. When student achievement levels were not considered, the effects of instructional methods on student outcomes were modest; OPBI students performed moderately better on short-answer exam questions than both LI and GPBI groups. High-achieving students showed no difference in performance for any of the instructional methods on any metric examined. In students with low-achieving academic histories, OPBI students largely outperformed LI students on all metrics (short-answer exam: P < 0.05, d = 1.865; multiple-choice question exam: P < 0.05, d = 1.166; and final score: P < 0.05, d = 1.265). They also outperformed GPBI students on short-answer exam questions (P < 0.05, d = 1.109) but not multiple-choice exam questions (P < 0.071, d = 0.716) or final course outcome (P = 0.328, d = 0.513). These findings strongly suggest that typically low-achieving students perform at a higher level under OPBI as long as the proper support systems (formative assessment and scaffolding) are provided to encourage student success.

AB We hypothesized that the intellectual development of students, i.e., their beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning, affects their intrinsic motivation and class performance. Specifically, we hypothesized that students with low intellectual development (i.e., the naive beliefs that knowledge is simple, absolute, and certain) have low intrinsic motivation and low class performance, whereas students with high intellectual development (i.e., more sophisticated beliefs that knowledge is complex, tentative, and evolving) have high intrinsic motivation and class performance. To test this hypothesis, we administered the Learning Context Questionnaire to measure intellectual development. In addition, we administered the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory to assess our students' intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, we performed regression analyses between intellectual development with both intrinsic motivation and class performance. The results document a positive relationship among intellectual development, intrinsic motivation, and class performance for female students only. In sharp contrast, there was a negative relationship between intellectual development, intrinsic motivation, and class performance for male students. The slope comparisons documented significant differences in the slopes relating intellectual development, intrinsic motivation, and class performance between female and male students. Thus, female students with more sophisticated beliefs that knowledge is personally constructed, complex, and evolving had higher intrinsic motivation and class performance. In contrast, male students with the naive beliefs that the structure of knowledge is simple, absolute, and certain had higher levels of intrinsic motivation and class performance. The results suggest that sex influences intellectual development, which has an effect on intrinsic motivation for learning a specific topic.

AB Many chemistry educators have adopted the process-oriented guided-inquiry learning (POGIL) pedagogy. However, it is not clear which aspects of POGIL are the most important in terms of actual learning. We compared 354 first-year undergraduate psychology students' learning in physiological psychology using four teaching methods: control, POGIL, POGIL without reporting [no report out (NRO)], and POGIL run by untrained graduate students [new facilitator (NF)]. Student activities were identical across POGIL variations and highly similar for control. Participants' knowledge was evaluated before (pretest), immediately after (posttest), and 2 wk later (followup). Control and POGIL groups showed no improvement at posttest, whereas NRO and NF groups both recalled more material than at pretest (P = 0.002 and P < 0.0005, respectively). In a surprise test 2 wk later, control (P < 0.0005), NRO (P = 0.03), and NF (P < 0.0005) groups recalled less than at posttest. The POGIL group showed the smallest drop in knowledge (P = 0.05). Importantly, the control group's knowledge was below pretest levels (P < 0.0005), whereas the POGIL, NRO, and NF groups' knowledge was not. Self-assessment of knowledge was consistent across groups at pretest, but POGIL participants had the lowest confidence at posttest and 2 wk later. At followup, the control, NRO, and NF groups showed greater confidence in their knowledge than the POGIL group (P = 0.03, P = 0.002, and P = 0.004, respectively). POGIL and its variations appear to consolidate existing knowledge against memory decay even when student confidence does not match performance.

AB "The viscosity of the blood in narrow capillary tubes" by Robin Fahraeus and Torsten Lindqvist (Am J Physiol 96: 562-568, 1931) can be a valuable opportunity for teaching basic hemorheological principles in undergraduate cardiovascular physiology. This classic paper demonstrates that a progressive decline in apparent viscosity occurs when blood flows through glass capillary tubes of diminishing radius, which was later designated the "Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect." Subsequent studies have shown that apparent viscosity continues to decline at diameters that correspond to the arteriolar segments of the systemic vascular tree, where the majority of the total peripheral resistance resides and is actively regulated in vivo. The Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect thus reduces microvascular resistance, thereby maintaining local tissue perfusion at a relatively lower blood pressure. The paper by Fahraeus and Lindqvist can be used as a platform for a plenary discussion of these concepts as well as of the relationships among hematocrit, vessel diameter, red blood cell deformability, and resistance to blood flow, and how these factors may affect the work of the heart.

AB Fulop RM, Tanner KD. Investigating high school students' conceptualizations of the biological basis of learning. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 131-142, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00093.2011.-Students go to school to learn. How much, however, do students understand about the biological basis of this everyday process? Blackwell et al. (1) demonstrated a correlation between education about learning and academic achievement. Yet there are few studies investigating high school students' conceptions of learning. In this mixed-methods research study, written assessments were administered to 339 high school students in an urban school district after they completed their required biology education, and videotaped interviews were conducted with 15 students. The results indicated that the majority of students know little about the biological basis of learning, even with prompting, and they recall having learned little about it in school. Students appear to believe that people control their own ability to learn, and some have developed personal hypotheses to describe the learning process. On written assessments, 75% of participants demonstrated a nonbiological framework for learning, and, during interviews, 67% of participants revealed misconceptions about the biological basis of learning. Sample quotes of these interviews are included in this report, and the implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Oriol NE, Hayden EM, Joyal-Mowschenson J, Muret-Wagstaff S, Faux R, Gordon JA. Using immersive healthcare simulation for physiology education: initial experience in high school, college, and graduate school curricula. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 252-259, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00043.2011.- In the natural world, learning emerges from the joy of play, experimentation, and inquiry as part of everyday life. However, this kind of informal learning is often difficult to integrate within structured educational curricula. This report describes an educational program that embeds naturalistic learning into formal high school, college, and graduate school science class work. Our experience is based on work with hundreds of high school, college, and graduate students enrolled in traditional science classes in which mannequin simulators were used to teach physiological principles. Specific case scenarios were integrated into the curriculum as problem-solving exercises chosen to accentuate the basic science objectives of the course. This report also highlights the historic and theoretical basis for the use of mannequin simulators as an important physiology education tool and outlines how the authors' experience in healthcare education has been effectively translated to nonclinical student populations. Particular areas of focus include critical-thinking and problem-solving behaviors and student reflections on the impact of the teaching approach.

AB DeHoff ME, Clark KL, Meganathan K. Learning outcomes and student-perceived value of clay modeling and cat dissection in undergraduate human anatomy and physiology. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 68-75, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00094.2010.-Alternatives and/or supplements to animal dissection are being explored by educators of human anatomy at different academic levels. Clay modeling is one such alternative that provides a kinesthetic, three-dimensional, constructive, and sensory approach to learning human anatomy. The present study compared two laboratory techniques, clay modeling of human anatomy and dissection of preserved cat specimens, in the instruction of muscles, peripheral nerves, and blood vessels. Specifically, we examined the effect of each technique on student performance on low-order and high-order questions related to each body system as well as the student-perceived value of each technique. Students who modeled anatomic structures in clay scored significantly higher on low-order questions related to peripheral nerves; scores were comparable between groups for high-order questions on peripheral nerves and for questions on muscles and blood vessels. Likert-scale surveys were used to measure student responses to statements about each laboratory technique. A significantly greater percentage of students in the clay modeling group "agreed" or "strongly agreed" with positive statements about their respective technique. These results indicate that clay modeling and cat dissection are equally effective in achieving student learning outcomes for certain systems in undergraduate human anatomy. Furthermore, clay modeling appears to be the preferred technique based on students' subjective perceptions of value to their learning experience.

AB Many factors contribute to students' academic success, and some, including first-generation (FG) college student status and aca-demic preparation, are especially relevant in physiology programs. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine FG col-lege students' perceptions of academic preparedness and intended success strategies with the goal of informing program-level strategies to support FG students in similar undergraduate physiology-related programs. FG freshmen completed short surveys and reflections at the start and end of the semester. Qualitative responses from written reflections were compiled, and content was analyzed. Students were high achievers in high school; 98% expected As and Bs in college, but only 53% had achieved this by the end of the first semester. At the start of the semester, FG students reported feeling prepared academically but were hop-ing to improve their academic readiness skills, and academic success plans focused on organizational strategies. At the end of the semester, some thought they were as prepared as they expected, but most found they were not as academically prepared for college as they had expected. Several minor themes were identified as areas to address with future cohorts. This study pro-poses several potential avenues by which to support FG freshmen's academic success in similar physiology programs, including early identification of at-risk students, setting realistic expectations, educating students early and often about evidence-based strategies, and developing academic recovery strategies as needed.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A qualitative investigation of first-generation (FG) college freshmen's perceptions of academic prepared-ness and intended success strategies informs the development of potential avenues by which to support FG freshmen in physi-ology programs.

AB We have used ultrasound imaging and technology as a tool for nonclinical teaching of basic physiological concepts for several years and are aware anecdotally that only a few others in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (UK/ROI) are also using ultrasound with this intention in physiology and anatomy teaching. To better understand what areas ultrasound is used for by others, along with what barriers might exist to its use, we reached out to colleagues in UK/ROI institutions instructing on anatomy and physiology courses by asking them to complete a survey regarding their experiences. Relatively few institutions (9%) reported using the technology in this way but covered physiology and anatomy teaching in most major body systems. The perception of responding educators overall is that, overwhelmingly, ultrasound offers a useful addition to the teaching of physiology and anatomy and is very popular with students. Barriers to its implementation were identified, including unfamiliarity with equipment and potential uses. Lack of funding for equipment and staff, issues with class sizes, and lack of curriculum time were also identified. Despite these potential impediments, most nonusers were interested in finding out about the uses of ultrasound as a teaching tool. We conclude that the teaching community would benefit from wider dissemination of local practices.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY We surveyed UK and Republic of Ireland institutions to establish the extent of ultrasound use in teaching undergraduate modules with significant anatomy or physiology content. Responses indicate that although ultrasound is used for a wide variety of systems, only a small proportion of courses use ultrasound for teaching. There is widespread interest in its use, with the main barriers being unfamiliarity with potential uses and the technology. We endorse further dissemination of this teaching practice.

AB Since its discovery in the mid-20th century, the Hodgkin-Huxley biophysical model of the squid giant axon's (SGA's) neurophysiology has traditionally served as the basis for the teaching of action potential (AP) dynamics in the physiology classroom. This model teaches that leak conductances set membrane resting potential; that fast, inactivating, voltage-gated sodium channels effect the SGA AP upstroke; and that delayed, rectifying, noninactivating voltage-gated potassium channels carry AP repolarization and the early part of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP). This model serves well to introduce students to the fundamental ideas of resting potential establishment and maintenance, as well as basic principles of AP generation and propagation. Furthermore, the Hodgkin-Huxley SGA model represents an excellent and accessible starting point for discussion of the concept of AP threshold and the role of passive electrical properties of the neuron. Additionally, the introduction of the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the SGA AP permits the integration of physiological principles, as instructors ask students to apply previously studied principles of transporter and channel biophysics to the essential physiological phenomenon of electrical signal conduction. However, both some early observations as well as more recent evidence strongly suggest that this seminal invertebrate model of AP dynamics does not appropriately capture the full story for mammalian axons. We review recent evidence that mammalian axonal nodes of Ranvier repolarize largely (though not exclusively) through the activity of leak potassium-ion (K+) conductances carried through two-pore domain (K-2P) channels. We call for changes to physiology textbooks and curricula to highlight this remarkable difference in invertebrate and mammalian AP repolarization mechanisms.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Historically, physiology courses have typically taught that action potential repolarization occurs exclusively due to the activation of delayed-rectifier voltage-gated potassium channels. Here, we review and highlight recent evidence that leak potassium channels of the two-pore domain (K-2P) class may largely serve this repolarization role at mammalian nodes of Ranvier. We call for the inclusion of these ideas in physiology curricula at all levels, from high school to graduate school.

AB Research investigating how the brain develops and learns profoundly impacts education. Understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for learning and memory and the factors that influence them, such as age, environment, emotions, and motivation, can transform educational strategies by contributing to the development of programs that optimize learning. Including neuroscience education in teachers' training requires teaching them a multidisciplinary approach to science, which presents a challenge. Furthermore, the potential educational advances from the incorporation of neuroscience into teachers' training are hindered by significant obstacles such as translating research into the classroom; this includes the spread of neuromyths and the products, practices, and programs based on them. Our group has 9 years of experience in developing courses for training teachers. However, in 2020 the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed on society a new way of carrying out its daily activities, including teaching. This study reports the experiences of our group as we developed the ninth edition of the Neuroscience Applied to Education teachers' training in an online format that included synchronous and asynchronous activities. Sixty teachers participated in the course. The synchronous meetings lasted 1.5 h/wk and addressed different themes: neuroscience and education, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurobiology of learning and memory, factors that interfere with learning, and pedagogical innovation. According to the teachers' perceptions, the course was fundamental for them in terms of acquiring new knowledge about neuroscience. Everyone agreed on the possible applicability of the concepts covered to improve their pedagogical practice and teaching environment.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study reports the experience of developing the ninth edition of the Neuroscience Applied to Education course in an online format that included synchronous and asynchronous activities. Here we show that schoolteachers consider the course important for acquiring new knowledge about neuroscience and the applicability of the concepts covered to improve their pedagogical practice and teaching environment. The online format did not prejudice the experience, and the technologies used were well evaluated.

AB Retrieval practice improves long-term retention. Use of interactive retrieval practice in large group, in-person and online live classes, in combination with outside resources, is unreported for medical physiology classes. The primary study purpose was to compare student cohorts' performance with or without retrieval practice in renal physiology classes, relative to the national average on customized national examinations in renal physiology, nonphysiology, and all questions. The secondary purpose was to examine the students' educational experience. For the primary purpose, we used a nonequivalent group, posttest-only design. For the secondary purpose, we used cross-sectional and qualitative designs. We analyzed examination results of 684 students in four academic years. For renal physiology questions, students performed significantly better in years with retrieval practice compared with years without it (P < 0.001). There was no change in nonphysiology scores over the four years. Performance in all questions, too, significantly improved (P < 0.001). A large majority (86%) of students indicated retrieval practice helped them learn renal physiology. Student ratings of quality in online classes, which featured interactive retrieval practice, were higher than that of in-person classes (P < 0.001). Qualitative analysis revealed students found interactive retrieval practice, scaffolding, outside resources, and the instructor's teaching style helpful. Educators in medical physiology classes can use our findings to implement interactive retrieval practice.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

ID NERVE
AB The application of physico-chemical principles has been routinely used to explain various physiological concepts. The Nernst equation is one example of this, used to predict the potential difference created by the transmembrane ion gradient resulting from uneven ion distribution within cellular compartments and the interstitial space. This relationship remains of fundamental importance to the understanding of electrical signaling in the brain, which relies on current flow across cell membranes. We describe four distinct occasions when the Nernst equation was ingeniously applied in experimental design to illuminate diverse cellular functions, from the dependence of the action potential on Na thorn influx to K thorn buffering in astrocytes. These examples are discussed with the aim of inspiring students to appreciate how the application of seemingly textbook-bound concepts can dictate novel experimental design across physiological disciplines.

AB This an account of student feedback on the distance online tools adopted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for teaching cardiovascular (CVS) physiology to Year 2 medical students within a problem-based learning (PBL) medical curriculum. Students' achievement upon assessment of CVS physiology theory content was also evaluated. Most students were ready for online learning in terms of appropriate equipment and internet connectivity. Most students expressed a preference for face-to-face learning of CVS physiology; however, they relied on recorded videos mainly for learning, instead of real-time attendance of physiology learning activities. Most students also reported a negative experience of distance online learning of CVS physiology during the lockdown, and only a few students expressed connection with their instructor through the physiology learning activities. Students undertaking online learning and examination during the pandemic achieved comparably to the prior year's cohort of PBL students learning in person and undertaking paper-based assessment. This indicates that our medical students preferred asynchronous learning during the pandemic confinement and that they sufficiently achieved their learning outcomes in CVS physiology, displaying resilience in their adaptation to the online learning and examination formet.

AB The field of neuroscience has made notable strides that have contributed to progress and change in a number of academic pursuits. However, the lack of understanding of basic neuroscience concepts among the general public is likely to hinder, and in some instances possibly even prevent, the appropriate application of scientific advancements to issues facing society today. Greater neuroscience literacy among the general public is necessary for the benefits of neuroscientific discovery to be fully realized. By actively enhancing neuroscience literacy, scientists can dispel falsehoods established by early research that harmed underrepresented communities, ensure that public conversations concerning neuroscience (e.g., legalization of psychotropic substances) revolve around facts, and empower individuals to make better health decisions. The widespread implementation of communication technologies and various forms of media indicate there are numerous means to engage classroom learners across disciplines and age cohorts and the public to increase neuroscience knowledge. Thus, it is not only necessary but timely that neuroscientists seek meaningful ways to bridge the widening knowledge gap with the public.

AB Remote teaching can be both challenging and motivating. Professors and lecturers have developed innovative strategies to improve students' education and engage students in synchronous and asynchronous classes. In this Illuminations paper, we describe BodyWorks, online tools to support courses in physiology, motor control, and biomechanics. The tools are interactive and easy to use, have low computer and internet demands, and can be used in many conditions and topics of study. All resources are freely available online in three different languages. We hope our initiative can help professors and students worldwide promote more interactive and engaging motor control and related topics classes for both synchronous and asynchronous formats.

AB This article traces 60 years of investigation of the molecular motor of skeletal muscle from the 1940s through the 1990s. It started with the discovery that myosin interaction with actin in the presence of ATP caused shortening of threads of actin and myosin. In 1957, structures protruding from myosin filaments were seen for the first time and called "cross bridges." A combination of techniques led to the proposal in 1969 of the "swinging-tilting cross bridge" model of contraction. In the early 1980s, a major problem arose when it was shown that a probe attached to the cross bridges did not move during contraction. A spectacular breakthrough came when it was discovered that only the cross bridge was required to support movement in an in vitro motility assay. Next it was determined that single myosin molecules caused the movement of actin filaments in 10-nm steps. The atomic structure of the cross bridge was published in 1993, and this discovery supercharged the muscle field. The cross bridge contained a globular head or motor domain that bound actin and ATP. But the most striking feature was the long tail of the cross bridge surrounded by two subunits of the myosin molecule. This structure suggested that the tail might act as a lever arm magnifying head movement. Consistent with this proposal, genetic techniques that lengthened the lever arm resulted in larger myosin steps. Thus the molecular motor of muscle operated not by the tilting of the globular head of myosin but by tilting of the lever arm generating the driving force for contraction.

AB Traditionally teachers display the learning outline at the beginning and conclusions at the end of didactic teaching sessions, and students may find it difficult to understand how teaching activities relate to learning objectives and what they should study for assessments. We introduced the "concept-sharing approach" in our neurophysiology course. This approach explicates how the content relates with learning objectives throughout the entirety of each teaching session to help the students assimilate the learning material and direct their learning in an objective-orientated way. In this study, we aimed to examine satisfaction of the concept-sharing approach in medical students and to investigate the relationship between student perception of this teaching strategy and academic performance. The results demonstrated that most participants (74.1%) had a positive impression of this teaching strategy at the end of the course, which was significantly >50.7% at the beginning of the course (P < 0.001). The participants who agreed the concept-sharing approach was useful had significantly higher final assessment (P = 0.014) and end-of-course formative assessment scores (P = 0.001). The findings indicate that after experiencing this new teaching approach, medical students appreciate its utility and that students who engage with this approach are more likely to perform well in assessments. In summary, the concept-sharing approach is a simple teaching strategy which was favored by students and may promote academic performance.

AB As literature indicates, historic racism and implicit bias throughout academia have been profound metrics leading to a lack of diversity, as related to people from underrepresented groups according to race and ethnicity, among biomedical sciences graduate students in U.S. universities. Recognizing such challenges, a team of biomedical scientists and inclusivity educators developed and implemented a pilot training program within an academic health sciences center as an initial step to educate faculty and staff regarding their roles in the promotion of an inclusive academic environment, receptive to all students, including underrepresented students. The 3-h workshop included didactic modules, videos, teaching modules, and active attendee participation. Faculty and staff were presented common terminology and ways to promote the development of an inclusive and diverse academic workforce. Compared with pre-workshop, post-workshop survey results indicated a statistically significant improvement in attendee knowledge of correctly identifying definitions of "implicit bias," "status leveling," "color-blind racial attitudes," "tokenism," and "failure to differentiate." Additionally, by the end of the workshop, participants had a statistically significant increase in self-perceptions regarding the importance of improving diversity and recognizing biases and stereotypes in graduate education, knowing what to say when interacting with people from different cultures, and the ability to acknowledge bias when mentoring students from groups underrepresented in the biomedical field. This preliminary initiative was successful in the introduction of faculty and staff to the importance of fostering an inclusive academic environment and thereby developing a diverse workforce.

AB Access to knowledge has never been easier in the internet age, and so it is important that students develop skills to discriminate undependable information from reliably investigated research. We have created an exercise that teaches good research practice by exploring the history, ethics, and design of clinical trials. Students apply their understanding of these principles through an assessed systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) exercise. Here, a clinically themed hypothesis is tested using a structured literature search in conjunction with an eligibility matrix to map study design, ethics, subject selection, randomization and blinding, methodological standards, study power, and other potential sources of interstudy heterogeneity. Data extracted from selected studies are used to produce a forest plot with an aggregated effect size, confidence range, and measure of interstudy heterogeneity. A funnel plot is then used in conjunction with the eligibility matrix to evaluate study bias tendency, and, in this way, students reflect on the factors that promote disparate conclusionmaking among studies with a common research focus. This exercise produced a normally distributed grade-profile across three academic-year cohorts, and comparison of individual exercise grade with yearlong aggregated average suggested students who performed less well on conventional assignments engaged successfully with the systematic nature of this assessment. Those opting to use this format for their final-year capstone project also performed above their grade point average from the preceding year. We suggest that SRMA offers a readily applied method for students to quantitatively explore how differences in experimental research practices influence study dependability.

AB Obesity and diabetes are two of the biggest public health problems in the modern world. One possible way to combat the rising prevalence of these diseases is through the spread of awareness about its consequences and how to prevent them. Therefore, educational interventions focused on teaching the physiological basis of these conditions might be valuable tools. However, most scholar curriculums lack high-quality material devoted to this topic. Thus we developed an educational booklet, composed of playful elements, targeted toward high school students and destined for application in classrooms. The efficacy of the developed material was validated through a pretest-posttest design. in which the students had to answer a 10-question test. After booklet completion. students had better outcomes, with an increase in the percentage of correct answers in 7 out of 10 questions contained in the test (P < 0.05). Thus we developed an effective material for usage in the high school classroom to spread the awareness of the risks of metabolic diseases and how to prevent them.

AB Cost-effective student engagement poses a challenge for instructors, especially those who may not be familiar with new technologies and mobile devices. In this workshop, participants, experienced and discussed two ways of using smartphones in physiology classes: to engage in an online learning environment for discussions, and to make physiological measurements. Participants signed up for individual Twitter accounts and learned how to tweet, retweet. message, use a URL shortener, and use hashtags. They then went on to locate articles on an assigned topic from the Twitter accounts of credible science sources (American Journal of Physiology, The Scientist, CDC.gov , WHO.int) and applied their Twitter skills to discuss the science topic of current interest. Additionally, participants shared their knowledge about the use of smartphones as a tool for teaching; they discussed the foundations of smartphone-assisted learning and the concept of mobile-learning laboratories, which we refer to as MobLeLabs. Participants also performed an experiment that used an Axe dance video and smartphone applications to measure changes in heart rate and reaction time. Our report describes this international hands-on teaching workshop and highlights its outcomes.

ID MULTITASKING; PERFORMANCE
AB Poor academic performance from extensive social media usage appears to be due to students' inability to multitask between distractions and academic work. However, the degree to which visually distracted students can acquire lecture information presented aurally is unknown. This study examined the ability of students visually distracted by social media to acquire information presented during a voice-over PowerPoint lecture, and to compare performance on examination questions derived from information presented aurally vs. that presented visually. Students (n = 20) listened to a 42-min cardiovascular pathophysiology lecture containing embedded cartoons while taking notes. The experimental group (n = 10) was visually, but not aurally, distracted by social media during times when cartoon information was presented, similar to 40% of total lecture time. Overall performance among distracted students on a follow-up, open-note quiz was 30% poorer than that for controls (P < 0.001). When the modality of presentation (visual vs. aural) was compared, performance decreased on examination questions from information presented visually. However, performance on questions from information presented aurally was similar to that of controls. Our findings suggest the ability to acquire information during lecture may vary, depending on the degree of competition between the modalities of the distraction and the lecture presentation. Within the context of current literature, our findings also suggest that timing of the distraction relative to delivery of material examined affects performance more than total distraction time. Therefore, when delivering lectures, instructors should incorporate organizational cues and active learning strategies that assist students in maintaining focus and acquiring relevant information.

TI Value of artisanal simulators to teach ultrasound-guided percutaneous

AB The present study aimed to evaluate the applicability of artisanal simulators to teach veterinary and medical students the ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy using a tru-cut needle. The artisanal simulators consisted of bovine liver between two layers of commercially available grape gelatin. Students were paired, with one doing the biopsy and the other the ultrasound guidance. After performing the biopsies, each student answered a questionnaire with close-ended questions using a visual analog scale. The evaluated items were realism of the model, liver scanning, procedure instructions, biopsy feasibility, tru-cut needle handling, technique learning, and confidence to perform in vivo procedures. Items that received a score of 7 or higher were considered strong items; items with a score between 5 and 6.9 were classified as average items; and items with a score of 5 or lower were considered weak items. The answers to all questions had an average score of 7 or higher, suggesting that the simulator was classified as strong for all of the evaluated items. Answers to question 7 suggested that some of the students did not develop confidence to perform a tru-cut biopsy on a patient. Students evaluated the artisanal simulator as a strong method to be used in ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy with a tru-cut needle. Additionally, the model presented a low cost of production and was proven accurate to teach biopsy skills in health professional schools dealing with veterinary or human medicine.

AB The validity of learning styles needs supports of additional objective evidence. The identification of learning styles using subjective evidence from VARK questionnaires (where V is visual, A is auditory, R is read/write, and K is kinesthetic) combined with objective evidence from visual event-related potential (vERP) studies has never been investigated. It is questionable whether picture superiority effects exist in V learners and R learners. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate whether vERP could show the relationship between vERP components and VARK learning styles and to identify the existence of picture superiority effects in V learners and R learners. Thirty medical students (15 V learners and 15 R learners) performed recognition tasks with vERP and an intermediate-term memory (ITM) test. The results of within-group comparisons showed that pictures elicited larger P200 amplitudes than words at the occipital 2 site (P < 0.05) in V learners and at the occipital 1 and 2 sites (P < 0.05) in R learners. The between-groups comparison showed that P200 amplitudes elicited by pictures in V learners were larger than those of R learners at the parietal 4 site (P < 0.05). The ITM test result showed that a picture set showed distinctively more correct responses than that of a word set for both V learners (P < 0.001) and R learners (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the result indicated that the P200 amplitude at the parietal 4 site could be used to objectively distinguish V learners from R learners. A lateralization existed to the right brain (occipital 2 site) in V learners. The ITM test demonstrated the existence of picture superiority effects in both learners. The results revealed the first objective electrophysiological evidence partially supporting the validity of the subjective psychological VARK questionnaire study.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
DE intestine; acetylcholine; epinephrine; enteric nervous system
ID INTERSTITIAL-CELLS; RHYTHMICITY
AB Intestinal smooth muscle contracts rhythmically in the absence of nerve and hormonal stimulation because of the activity of pacemaker cells between and within the muscle layers. This means that the autonomic nervous system modifies rather than initiates intestinal contractions. The practical described here gives students an opportunity to observe this spontaneous activity and its modification by agents associated with parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity. A section of the rabbit small intestine is suspended in an organ bath, and the use of a pressure transducer and data-acquisition software allows the measurement of tension generated by the smooth muscle of intestinal walls. The application of the parasympathetic neurotransmitter ACh at varying concentrations allows students to observe an increase in intestinal smooth muscle tone with increasing concentrations of this muscarinic receptor agonist. Construction of a concentration-effect curve allows students to calculate an EC50 value for ACh and consider some basic concepts surrounding receptor occupancy and activation. Application of the hormone epinephrine to the precontracted intestine allows students to observe the inhibitory effects associated with sympathetic nerve activation. Introduction of the drug atropine to the preparation before a maximal concentration of ACh is applied allows students to observe the inhibitory effect of a competitive antagonist on the physiological response to a receptor agonist. The final experiment involves the observation of the depolarizing effect of K+ on smooth muscle. Students are also invited to consider why the drugs atropine, codeine, loperamide, and botulinum toxin have medicinal uses in the management of gastrointestinal problems.

ID LONGITUDINAL-FIELD; KNOWLEDGE
AB Lecturers have reverted to using a "blended" approach when teaching anatomy and physiology. Student responses as to how this contributes to their learning satisfaction were investigated using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of closed-and open-ended questions that were based on three determinants of learning satisfaction: perceived course learnability, learning community support, and perceived learning effectiveness. Regarding course learnability, students responded positively on questions regarding the relevance of the subject for their future careers. However, students identified a number of distractions that prevented them from paying full attention to their studies. As far as learning community support was concerned, respondents indicated that they were more comfortable asking a peer for support if they were unsure of concepts than approaching the lecturing staff. Most of the students study in their second language, and this was identified as a stumbling block for success. There was a difference in opinion among students regarding the use of technology for teaching and learning of anatomy and physiology. From students' perceptions regarding learning effectiveness, it became clear that students' expectations of anatomy and physiology were unrealistic; they did not expect the module to be so comprehensive. Many of the students were also "grade oriented" rather than "learning oriented" as they indicated that they were more concerned about results than "owning" the content of the module. Asking students to evaluate aspects of the teaching and learning process have provided valuable information to improve future offerings of anatomy and physiology.

AB During underwater submersion, the body responds by conserving O-2 and prioritizing blood flow to the brain and heart. These physiological adjustments, which involve the nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems, are known as the diving response and provide an ideal example of integrative physiology. The diving reflex can be stimulated in the practical laboratory setting using breath holding and facial immersion in water. Our undergraduate physiology students complete a laboratory class in which they investigate the effects of stimulating the diving reflex on cardiovascular variables, which are recorded and calculated with a Finapres finger cuff. These variables include heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, and arterial pressures (mean, diastolic, and systolic). Components of the diving reflex are stimulated by 1) facial immersion in cold water (15 degrees C), 2) breathing with a snorkel in cold water (15 degrees C), 3) facial immersion in warm water (30 degrees C), and 4) breath holding in air. Statistical analysis of the data generated for each of these four maneuvers allows the students to consider the factors that contribute to the diving response, such as the temperature of the water and the location of the sensory receptors that initiate the response. In addition to providing specific details about the equipment, protocols, and learning outcomes, this report describes how we assess this practical exercise and summarizes some common student misunderstandings of the essential physiological concepts underlying the diving response.

AB Evolutionary history and structural considerations constrain all aspects of animal physiology. Constraints on invertebrate locomotion are especially straightforward for students to observe and understand. In this exercise, students use spiders to investigate the concepts of adaptation, structure-function relationships, and trade-offs. Students measure burst and endurance performance in several taxonomic families of spiders whose ecological niches have led to different locomotory adaptations. Based on observations of spiders in their natural habitat and prior background information, students make predictions about spider performance. Students then construct their own knowledge by performing a hands-on, inquiry-based scientific experiment where the results are not necessarily known. Depending on the specific families chosen, students can observe that web-dwelling spiders have more difficulty navigating complex terrestrial terrain than ground-dwelling spiders and that there is a trade-off between burst performance and endurance performance in spiders. Our inexpensive runway design allows for countless variations on this basic experiment; for example, we have successfully used runways to show students how the performance of heterothermic ectotherms varies with temperature. High levels of intra- and interindividual variation in performance underscore the importance of using multiple trials and statistical tests. Finally, this laboratory activity can be completely student driven or standardized, depending on the instructor's preference.

AB Poor awareness among medical graduates about basic life support (BLS) is a matter of great concern. The presence of a trained rescuer is the key determinant of ultimate survival from life-threatening emergencies. To achieve this goal, early exposure to such life-saving skills is the right decision to foster these skills for medical students, which can be reenforced in succeeding years. Forty-two first-year medical students participated in this study. The entire procedure consisted of faculty training, assessment of knowledge of students by a pretest questionnaire, a lecture, a demonstration, and hands-on training using a mannequin (with special emphasis on the site, depth, rate, and sustainment of uninterrupted chest compressions). Posttest 1 was conducted to assess the knowledge gained. The retention of knowledge and skills in the second year was evaluated by posttest 2 and directly observed procedural skills, respectively. Student feedback was collected on five-point Likert scale. Analysis using a Freidman test indicated the mean rank for posttest 1 (2.81) to be significantly higher than the pretest (1.26), indicating a gain in knowledge. The mean rank for posttest 2 (1.93) was lower than for posttest 1 (2.81) but was significantly higher compared with the pretest (1.26), indicating a significant retention of knowledge during the second year. Directly observed procedural skill evaluation showed that 7% students could perform all the seven steps correctly and that 74% students could perform three or more steps correctly, signifying a good retention of skill. Two students taught BLS skills to their family members as well. The results of this study suggest that the program provides students with sound basic knowledge and adequate practical skills in BLS.

AB Physiology is a core requirement in the undergraduate biomedical engineering curriculum. In one or two introductory physiology courses, engineering students must learn physiology sufficiently to support learning in their subsequent engineering courses and careers. As preparation for future learning, physiology instruction centered on concepts may help engineering students to further develop their physiology and biomedical engineering knowledge. Following the Backward Design instructional model, a series of seven concept-based lessons was developed for undergraduate engineering students. These online lessons were created as prerequisite physiology training to prepare students to engage in a collaborative engineering challenge activity. This work is presented as an example of how to convert standard, organ system-based physiology content into concept-based content lessons.

AB Ziegler B, Montplaisir L. Examining integrative thinking through the transformation of students' written reflections into concept webs. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 307-312, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00057.2012.-A shift is currently taking place in which explicit connections between content are being emphasized. Biology is not an isolated discipline, yet undergraduate courses frequently focus on discrete knowledge. Students often engage in rote learning, struggle with transforming and applying content. Integrative thinking occurs when students recognize connections to content. Written reflections provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate this thinking. We transformed student-written reflections into concept webs to gain insights into how students connect biological concepts. We were interested in determining if characteristics of integrative thinking develop through reflections. The results indicate a significant relationship between concepts and integrated relationships. Integrative thinking varied but declined overall. Concept webs allow for an examination of student integrative thinking through the transformation of reflections and provide insights into the connections and relationships that students draw between biological concepts. Reflections can transform learning by facilitating and allowing for the evaluation of integrative thinking.

AB Pandolf KB, Francesconi R, Sawka MN, Cymerman A, Hoyt RW, Young AJ, Zambraski EJ. United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine: Warfighter research focusing on the past 25 years. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 353-360, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00049.2011.-The United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) celebrated its 50th anniversary on July 1, 2011. This article reviews its history, evolution, and transition of its research programs as well as its scientific and military accomplishments, emphasizing the past 25 yr. During the 1990s, USARIEM published a series of pocket guides providing guidance for sustaining Warfighter health and performance in Southwest Asia, Somalia, the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Haiti. Issues identified during Operation Desert Storm elicited research that improved nutritional guidelines for protracted desert operations; safer use of nuclear, chemical, and biological protective clothing; equipment, development, and fielding of efficient microclimate cooling systems; and effective evaluation of pharmaceuticals to protect soldiers from chemical and biological threats. During the first decade of the 21st century, USARIEM and the Department of the Army published official medical/performance doctrines for operations in the heat and cold and at high altitude. The current Global War on Terrorism focused research to improve doctrines for hot, cold, and high-altitude operations, reduce musculoskeletal training injuries, provide improved field nutrition, more efficient planning for operational water requirements, and improve both military clothing and materiel. This article also describes the critically important interactions and communications between USARIEM and deployed units and the benefits to Warfighters from this association. This report presents USARIEM's unique and world-class facilities, organizational changes, scientific and support personnel, and major research accomplishments, including the publication of 2,200 scientific papers over the past 25 yr.

AB Harris JR. Peer assessment in large undergraduate classes: an evaluation of a procedure for marking laboratory reports and a review of related practices. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 178-187, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00115.2010.-This study provides evidence that peer marking can be a reliable tool for assessing laboratory reports in large cohorts. It was conducted over a 4-yr period with first-year undergraduates (similar to 180 students/cohort) taking a mammalian physiology course, but the procedure adopted would be applicable to any other laboratory-based discipline. The process was found to be efficient in staff time, enabling a summative practical report to be marked in < 1 h (< 5% of the time that had previously been required for staff marking), facilitating rapid feedback to students on their performance. When samples of the peer-assessed reports were marked by a single member of staff, there was excellent correlation between peer and staff marks (r = 0.96-0.98), although peer-awarded marks exceeded staff marks by an average of 2.5-3.0%. The validity of peer marking was independent of both the sex of the marker and the staff score awarded to the marker for the same piece of work. Feedback from students was largely positive; they reported that the procedure adopted was effective in increasing their understanding of the underlying physiology and contributed to their understanding of best practice in presenting a laboratory report. Seventy percent of students agreed that it was acceptable for peer assessment to contribute a small (up to 5%) component of the overall mark for the course. The results are discussed in relation to other reports of peer marking, particularly when used to assess an academic product or process in a scientific discipline.

AB Carvalho H, West CA. Voluntary participation in an active learning exercise leads to a better understanding of physiology. Adv ;Physiol Educ 35: 53-58, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan. 00011.2010.-Students learn best when they are focused and thinking about the subject at hand. To teach physiology, we must offer opportunities for students to actively participate in class. This approach aids in focusing their attention on the topic and thus generating genuine interest in the mechanisms involved. This study was conducted to determine if offering voluntary active learning exercises would improve student understanding and application of the material covered. To compare performance, an anonymous cardiorespiratory evaluation was distributed to two groups of students during the fall (control, n = 168) and spring (treatment, n = 176) semesters. Students in both groups were taught by traditional methods, and students in the treatment group had the option to voluntary participate in two additional active learning exercises: 1) a small group discussion, where students would discuss a physiology topic with their Teaching Assistant before running BIOPAC software for the laboratory exercise and 2) a free response question, where students anonymously responded to one short essay question after the laboratory exercise. In these formative assessments, students received feedback about their present state of learning from the discussion with their peers and also from the instructor comments regarding perceived misconceptions. As a result of the participation in these activities, students in the treatment group had a better overall performance [chi(2) (degree of freedom = 1) = 31.2, P < 0.001] on the evaluation (treatment group: 62% of responses correct and control group: 49%) with an observed difference of 13% (95% confidence interval: 8, 17). In conclusion, this study presents sufficient evidence that when the opportunity presents itself, students become active participants in the learning process, which translates into an improvement in their understanding and application of physiological concepts.

AB Pulver SR, Hornstein NJ, Land BL, Johnson BR. Optogenetics in the teaching laboratory: using channelrhodopsin-2 to study the neural basis of behavior and synaptic physiology in Drosophila. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 82-91, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00125.2010.-Here we incorporate recent advances in Drosophila neurogenetics and "optogenetics" into neuroscience laboratory exercises. We used the light-activated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and tissue-specific genetic expression techniques to study the neural basis of behavior in Drosophila larvae. We designed and implemented exercises using inexpensive, easy-to-use systems for delivering blue light pulses with fine temporal control. Students first examined the behavioral effects of activating glutamatergic neurons in Drosophila larvae and then recorded excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) mediated by ChR2 activation at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Comparison of electrically and light-evoked EJPs demonstrates that the amplitudes and time courses of light-evoked EJPs are not significantly different from those generated by electrical nerve stimulation. These exercises introduce students to new genetic technology for remotely manipulating neural activity, and they simplify the process of recording EJPs at the Drosophila larval NMJ. Relatively little research work has been done using ChR2 in Drosophila, so students have opportunities to test novel hypotheses and make tangible contributions to the scientific record. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of student experiences suggest that these exercises help convey principles of synaptic transmission while also promoting integrative and inquiry-based studies of genetics, cellular physiology, and animal behavior.

AB Oral demonstration of knowledge is an effective learning and assessment strategy. It has been shown that generating explanations to oneself, or self-explaining, can improve student understanding of information. This can be achieved via student -generated videos. The quantitative effects of student-generated videos on learning and assessment in postsecondary education are unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the effects asynchronous student-generated videos have on student learning and assessment in a large-enrollment (-400 students), undergraduate physiology course. Students were charged with making self-generated videos discussing major physiological concepts and uploading these videos to Flip for assessment. Flip is an online, social education platform for asynchronous video-based discussion. In the present study, we combined four semesters (n = 1,100 students) of Flip data and analyzed the effects it had on student examination performance. Specifically, we first analyzed how students performed on exam questions corresponding to their Flip prompts in comparison to students not assigned those prompts [25/44 (57%) were statistically significantly different]. Second, we analyzed the association between Flip prompt score and performance on corresponding exam questions [39/44 (89%) were statistically significantly different]. Third, we analyzed the association between cumulative Flip score and performance on all corresponding, and noncorresponding exam questions. Finally, we analyzed the association between cumulative Flip score and averaged exam performance. There was a positive association (r = 0.54). Taken together, our data suggest that asynchronous student-generated Flip videos can facilitate student learning and assessment in a large-enrollment, undergraduate physiology course.

AB Formative assessment provides feedback to both students and instructors about the process of learning. The core concept structure-function provides a foundation upon which many topics in anatomy and physiology can be built across all levels of organization. This study contributes to existing research about student conceptual understanding of the core concepts. Implications for practitioners include the design of formative assessments and a suite of questions to be used to gauge student understanding of structure-function.
   The structure and function relationship is a core concept identified by physiology faculty. Prior research has shown this may be a difficult concept for students to understand. Formative written assessments, such as short answer essay questions, allow students to demonstrate their thinking by encouraging students to use their diverse ideas to construct their responses. Varying the context of a question, such as the inclusion of a scenario, may be used to provide insight into the different stages of students' emerging biological expertise. Short answer questions based on the core concept structure & LRARR;function were administered to students in a junior level General Physiology course and a sophomore level Human Anatomy and Physiology course at a large southeastern public university. Questions were based on the integumentary, muscular, digestive, and cardiovascular systems. Student responses were scored with a conceptual rubric developed for each question prompt as well as each organ system represented in the question prompts. Students were interviewed to determine if their responses to the short answer questions accurately reflected their thinking. Less than half of the student responses in this study demonstrated a conceptual understanding of the structure-function relationship. Students demonstrated different conceptual understanding of structure & LRARR;function concepts depending on the question prompt with a scenario versus the question prompt without a scenario. The question prompts with scenarios versus non-scenarios provided a different context, which may have influenced student explanations. These results suggest that instructors should provide students with questions in varying contexts to allow students to demonstrate their heterogeneous ideas about a concept.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Formative assessment provides feedback to both students and instructors about the process of learning. The core concept structure-function provides a foundation upon which many topics in anatomy and physiology can be built across all levels of organization. This study contributes to existing research about student conceptual understanding of the core concepts.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional face-to-face human physiology teaching for students at the Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Thailand since February 2020. An online curriculum for both lectures and laboratory sessions was developed to continue the education. This work compared the effectiveness of online physiology labs to the traditional onsite counterparts for 120 dental and pharmacy sophomore students during the 2020 academic year. The method used was a Microsoft Teams synchronous online laboratory experience consisting of eight topics. Faculty lab facilitators created protocols, video scripts, online assignments, and instruction notes. Group lab instructors prepared and delivered the content for recording and led the student discussion. Data recording and live discussion were synchronized and executed. The response rates for the control (2019) and study (2020) groups were 36.89 and 60.83%, respectively. The control group reported higher satisfaction about general laboratory experience, compared to the online study group. The online group rated the laboratory online experience with equal satisfaction to that of an onsite lab experience. The onsite control group reported 55.26% satisfaction with the equipment instrument, while only 32.88% online group voiced their approval of this measure. It was understandable because the excitement in physiology work relies heavily on the experience of the work (P < 0.027). With the same difficulty index for both academic year examination papers, the nonsignificant difference in academic performance of the control and study groups (59.50 +/- 13.50 and 62.40 +/- 11.43, respectively) showed the effectiveness of our online synchronous physiology lab teaching. In conclusion, the online physiology learning experience was appreciated when a good design was achieved.

TI COVID struggles: undergraduate teaching assistants balance teaching and

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Editorial Material
DE coping; COVID; learning; teaching assistants
AB Undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs) have become valuable collaborators with faculty in large undergraduate first-year classes. Their participation requires them to manage their teaching duties and their own learning. The pandemic posed unusual problems for them. Here, two students, along with their instructor, provide an inside look. Throughout the pandemic, UTAs were found to increase their efforts during tutorials in attempts to help ensure that students were more prepared and engaged through the online learning formats. New strategies were implemented to maintain student attendance and participation in class, which greatly increased the workload for UTAs. Students not turning on their cameras and speaking up in online classes made teaching more tiring and stressful, which was compounded by the already present "Zoom fatigue" during online education. UTAs found real challenges in balancing senior year classes and extracurriculars with preparation for tutorials, especially closer to assignment or exam deadlines when the engagement and questions from students would sharply increase. Despite numerous efforts and adaptations made by UTAs to adjust to the impacts of the pandemic, online learning was an immense challenge to both students and teachers in comparison to the in-person formats.

AB COVID-19 struck the world suddenly and unexpectedly. Since traditional education requires face-to-face communication, to avoid further spreading of the virus a majority part of that education has moved online. Our study attempts to compare the differences between online medical education with a unique course design and traditional face-to-face education. We conducted a retro-spective analysis of a total of 4,098 medical students between 2019 and 2020, including two groups of students who received online education and classroom education for the same subjects, respectively. Freshmen enrolled in September 2018 received traditional classroom physiology and pharmacology education in the spring semester of 2019. Because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, freshmen who were enrolled in September 2019 received online physiology and pharmacology education in the spring semester of 2020. The final marks of the two groups of students were recorded and compared. Data on students participating in online discussions, learning, homework, and watching instructional videos were also recorded. There was no sig-nificant difference in the final academic performance between the two groups [average mark: 55.93 (online education) vs. 56.27 (classroom education), P = 0.488]. Further analysis showed that student participation rates in online discussions, online learning, and online viewing of instructional videos were closely correlated with final grades in online courses (P < 0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that the pedagogical effects of online education during COVID-19 were promising, and we provide a well -designed medical online course to inspire further improvements in online education. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive temporary conversion of offline education to online edu-cation worldwide. Previous studies have noted that more students believed they had better learning experience in face-to-face learning. However, with our method of online teaching, we still showed a relatively similar performance result compared with off-line education.

AB This study assessed the impact of an "active learning" strategy employed alone or in combination with traditional lectures on the learning of mammalian physiology by undergraduate students. The study investigated the impact of three teaching strategies, namely 1) traditional lecture, 2) group discussion alone, and 3) combination of lecture and group discussion. For all strategies, students were given homework in a textbook and they completed written assignments before each session. Every student led the discussion of at least one assigned theme during each group session. The students had no access to the textbook or notes during group discussions. Four examinations (3 in-semester and a final) assessed the students' knowledge of fundamental concepts of physiology of specific organ systems. Part of the final examination reassessed knowledge of previously tested topics. The results show that the teaching modality employed to introduce physiology topics influenced students' learning. The average marginal effect of the lecture + discussion modality (average improve-ment linked to lecture + discussion strategy) on students' performance was 6.45% [95% confidence interval (CI95) (4.73, 8.16), P = 1.74 x 10-13], and the average improvement associated with the discussion-only modality was 5.5% [CI95 (3.84, 7.16), P = 7.84 x 10-11]. On average, all class ranks performed better on materials covered under active learning settings than under lecture-only conditions. Moreover, students' performance under combined lecture and discussion conditions is predictive of their overall performance in the course. The results support the positive effect of student-centered learning and demonstrate the efficacy of a combination of lectures and group discussions on learning of physiology by nonmajor students.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has been a strong driver for moving more teaching and learning activities online. Border restrictions have had a severe impact on international students either hoping to enroll in courses offered in Australia or continue with such courses if they are already enrolled. The online learning experience is likely different between students onshore and offshore. This study took a unique opportunity to investigate any such differences in students' attitudes toward remote learning, necessitated by the pandemic, by comparing two cohorts of students, Australia versus China based. An anonymous survey using the Likert Scale and open-ended questions was available for student feedback on subject delivery. The students based in Australia expressed a preference for remote learning due to the convenience of attendance and availability of the video recordings. However, students in China had a strong preference for face-to-face sessions, with the lack of prior experience in an English-speaking learning environment and hesitance to speak with the lecturers and engage in the learning activities possible reasons for this. In quizzes, students in Australia performed better than those in China regardless of local or international student status. This difference may be due to the Australian-based students' prior experience of English-speaking environments and open-book quizzes. In conclusion, remote learning in a familiar language and learning environment is accepted by students, whereas if the teaching is delivered in a second language using unfamiliar teaching methods, remote learning will require additional scaffolding to enhance their learning experience.

AB Traditional didactic methods have not been successful in promoting independent and reflective students. Thus new teaching techniques are essential to optimize the way students learn. This study aimed to evaluate the perception of students, from the Faculty of Ceilandia, University of Brasilia (FCE/UnB), about the active method "inverted class," which has as its primary characteristic to stimulate the student to study and research the contents before the theoretical classes or explanation of the teacher. To this end, 64 students of the summer course participated in the Flipped Classroom and later evaluated the discipline method. Initially, they received a script with clinical questions about the class's content, which should be discussed and answered about the basic, clinical, and practical application concepts. To evaluate the didactic method applied, on the last day of class, the summer class students were invited to answer a survey about satisfaction when learning the contents. For 98% of the students, the teaching method used was approved. It is also emphasized that this class had 48 repeating students, unmotivated with the course because, for many, they declared themselves unable to be approved. Given the success of the method, we decided to apply it throughout 2018, so the method was applied to over 180 students of FCE/UnB health courses. In short, it is considered that the results presented here to support other studies that highlight the need for changes in traditional teaching methods, which is a didactic option in undergraduate courses.

AB There is increasing evidence that attendance is not a reliable predictor of academic performance, which invites the question of whether attendance may have alternative positive effects such as increased student wellness. While conducting an observational cohort study on the relationship of attendance to performance and wellness, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown changed the ability of students to attend class. Matriculating medical students were recruited to participate at the beginning of their first year in August 2019. In-person attendance was collected prospectively until the lockdown began in March 2020. This was then correlated with performance on course final examinations and responses to two separate incidences of a survey on stress, burnout, social isolation, and loneliness. The first survey was deployed January through February 2020 (pre-COVID) and the second June 2020 (during COVID lockdown). Attendance declined across the year (76.0%-25.0%). There was a small positive correlation of attendance to performance in module 1 (r = 0.235, P = 0.035) with none in the remaining two modules (P = 0.870, P = 0.410). The high attenders at the time of the lockdown had no decline in their performance when attendance was no longer possible. Attendance negatively correlated with stress and loneliness but not with the remainder of the wellness metrics. There was no significant change in any of the wellness metrics between the pre-COVID and during COVID time points. While the data support the conclusion that attendance is not required to maintain performance in this population, these data suggest a small protective effect against stress and loneliness.

AB The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) mandates that its Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and Institutional Development Award Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) institute formal mentoring programs to promote the core program objective of junior investigator development. Despite this NIGMS requirement, and the many career-related benefits associated with mentoring, few tools exist for purposes of rigorously evaluating COBRE and INBRE mentoring programs. The purpose of this project was to develop a mentoring assessment tool to aid in the evaluation of COBRE and INBRE mentoring programs. In study 1, a list of items comprising the tool was created via a multiphase item generation process based on input received from subject matter experts within the Cognitive and Neurobiological Approaches to Plasticity Center. In study 2, feedback about this tool was solicited from 78 grant directors, mentees, and mentors representing 21 unique COBRE programs and 8 unique INBRE programs from across the United States. The results provide initial evidence that this tool possesses suitable psychometric properties, is a flexible instrument with many potential uses, and represents a valuable resource for helping evaluate COBRE and INBRE mentoring programs. Having a tool for evaluating mentoring can help promote the grant success and career development of junior investigators in COBRE and INBRE programs and help program directors develop more sustainable research centers.

AB The field of life sciences encompasses a myriad of disciplines that collectively provide insight toward the intrinsic framework of life. Developmental physiology is one of these disciplines that can describe the origins of life at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal level. However, organismal development is a continual process that transcends conception and progresses throughout the lifetime of an organism. In this Illumination, we discuss opportunities that secondary-level life science educators have when teaching developmental physiology through an agricultural lens. Specifically, we propose teaching about the origins of meat and milk, as a nontraditional approach for introducing developmental physiology to students. To justify this notion, we explore how novel research in livestock production focuses on meeting food demands imposed by our growing global population. In addition, we link these concepts to commonly employed standards in secondary-level science classrooms across the United States. In conclusion, the science of livestock production provides a window of opportunity for secondary-level physiology instructors to teach developmental physiology in a form that can readily adhere to institutionally employed standards.

AB In the wake of COVID-19, the postgraduate activities in physiology were shifted from live (face to face teaching) to virtual mode. This transition posed a challenge to postgraduate students and faculty moderators, especially for participant-centric group discussion, wherein face-to-face interaction contributes significantly to active learner engagement. To bridge the gap between live group discussion (GD) and virtual GD in the conventional format (VGD), we implemented an innovative yet feasible multistep approach of conducting structured virtual group discussion (sVGD). It involved priming of students during the preparatory phase and incorporation of the Tuckman model of group dynamics, which consists of sequential substages of forming, storming, norming, and performing into the virtual format. Unsupervised synchronous and asynchronous, as well as supervised synchronous interactions within and in between the minigroups in a structured way, led to active engagement of students with one another and the moderator, despite the constraints imposed by the virtual format. After establishing the feasibility of the approach during the first GD (sVGD-1), sVGD-2 was conducted, further refining the approach, and feedback was obtained from the postgraduate students. Pre-GD feedback revealed that the live session was preferred over virtual for the conduct of GD, whereas both live GD and sVGD were perceived to be more effective than VGD in the post-GD feedback. Such pedagogical innovations may also help to address the challenges posed in traditional teaching across the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medical education and beyond during such unforeseeable circumstances.

AB The teaching-learning process is complex and requires continuous research and dedication. Research has been important to prove that student achievement can improve when active methodologies are properly implemented, either in isolation or integrated with a short lecture. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the performance and perception of first-year medical students subjected to a protocol involving the integration of a short lecture and collaborative compilation of portfolios on the topic of digestive physiology. After the lectures and elaboration of the portfolios, the students completed two tests: cognitive monitoring test (CMT) and integrative cognitive test (ICT), and then, they gave their opinions of the strategy. For CMT, the percentage of grade exceeding 7.0 was higher for the group who performed the portfolio activity, compared with the group who did not undertake the activity, and there was a lower percentage of incorrect answers among the portfolio group students, compared with the group that did not perform the activity. For ICT, the percentage of grades exceeding 7.0 was higher for the students who used the portfolio, compared with those who did not perform the activity, and there was also a reduction in incorrect answers among students who performed the portfolio activity, compared with those who did not perform the activity. The combination of short lectures and collaborative group work using a portfolio improved the grades obtained for digestive physiology. Most of the students believed that the collaborative work contributed to their learning about digestive physiology. In addition, most of them were comfortable working in their groups and did not feel dominated by other group members.

AB The ability to understand the relationship between the reversal potential and the membrane potential is a fundamental skill that must be mastered by students studying membrane excitability. To clarify this relationship, we have reframed a classic experiment carried out by Hodgkin and Katz, where we compare graphically the membrane potential at three phases of the action potential (resting potential, action potential peak, and afterhyperpolarization) to reversal potential for K+ (E-K), reversal potential for Na (E-Na), and membrane potential (E-m) (calculated by the Goldman Hodgkin Katz equation) to illustrate that the membrane potential approaches the reversal potential of the ion to which it is most permeable at that instant.

AB Academic advising outcomes can be linked to both student success and retention. Yet relatively little is known specifically related to advising in physiology programs. Professional organizations dedicated to academic advising in general, and more specifically advising future health professional students exist, yet, whether current physiology programs utilize these resources remains unknown, as does a number of other demographic information about advising in physiology programs. Here we present data gathered from a sample of physiology educators to inform what current advising practices of physiology students are. Forty-five respondents from a variety of institutions and programs provided information on advising structures, resources utilized, student populations, and concerns. While programs may differ, many of the concerns regarding advising physiology students are the same.

ID TESTABLE CONCEPT MAPS; PATHOGENESIS; EDUCATION; BENEFITS
AB Concept mapping methodology is a way of representing knowledge described as a useful tool in medical education. It was introduced in the pathophysiology curricular unit at NOVA Medical School in 2002, within an ongoing experience of problem-based learning. Our goal is to present a comparison between the students' opinions and performances in two academic years, 2017-18 and 2018-19, to evaluate the effects of pedagogical changes in the concept mapping methodology, applied in the last year, which is also described in detail. Our convenience samples were composed by 224 students in 2017-2018 and by 216 students in 2018-2019. The analysis used the students' responses to the yearly institutional questionnaire on the quality of teaching and to a specific questionnaire applied to evaluate the tutorial sessions of 2018-19. Both were anonymous, and the response rate was above 50%. A comparison was also made between the continuous assessment during the tutorial sessions, expressed as a final cumulative score, and the results of an obligatory multiple-choice final test. The students considered the introduced pedagogical changes useful in their different components, such as identification of core concepts, construction of mini-maps, and their inclusion in final global maps. The better performance of the tutors, signaled by the students in 2018-19, was probably due to the preparatory pedagogical sessions.

AB Ultrasound imaging is being used increasingly to aid in the teaching of human physiology and anatomy. Here we describe how its use can be integrated into the teaching of concepts surrounding venous circulation. specifically 1) venous valves and the muscle pump, 2) the effects of hydrostatic pressure on venous pressure, and 3) central venous pressure. The imaging procedures described are relatively simple but add a dimension that helps deliver the teaching points clearly and is enjoyable for students. They also aid in the link of basic physiology to clinical aspects of venous circulatory physiology.

ID ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; CLASS ATTENDANCE
AB Historically, attendance has been a marker of academic performance, but the current medical education literature has had mixed results. In addition, attendance is dropping in the preclinical curricula, whereas, at the same time, the focus on United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 performance is increasing. This present study is a mixed-method approach correlating student attendance and access to the formal curriculum in a second-year pathophysiology course to performance on Step 1. Additionally, survey and focus group data evaluated the usage and importance of both the formal curriculum and third-party resources. Out of 112 eligible students, 77 participated in the study. There was no correlation between attendance or access to the learning materials and Step 1 performance. There was a strong correlation between the performance on the final examination and that of Step 1 (r = 0.813; P < 0.001) and a moderate correlation between formative quiz (r = 0.321; P = 0.005) and individual readiness assessment test performance (r = 0.351: P = 0.02) and Step 1 performance. Survey and focus group data show that students place high importance on faculty-developed materials that they can use on their own, but not attendance. The third-party resources are highly used as an adjunct to the formal curriculum and to focus on Step 1 study. Attendance and access to the formal curriculum do not predict Step 1 performance, whereas performance on high- and low-stakes internal assessments do. Further study on how the lack of social interaction gained from attendance affects development of other competencies and the learning climate are warranted.

   STATEMENT
AB The textbook is a pedagogical tool that provides students and professionals with scientific information. As exercise is an important strategy for the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and arterial hypertension, the presence of correct and up-to-date scientific information in exercise physiology textbooks is important. Our aim was to analyze T2DM and arterial hypertension content in exercise physiology textbooks and compare this content with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) position stands. Comparative descriptions were made between information regarding T2DM and arterial hypertension found in textbooks (n = 10) and similar information contained in the official ACSM position stands. The quality of the content was compared with current scientific information present in the ACSM position stands. In regards to T2DM, eight textbooks provided information regarding the purpose and benefits of exercise, two provided information regarding exercise prescription, seven provided information regarding the type of exercise, six provided information regarding general care and recommendations, and five provided information regarding the mechanisms involved. In regards to arterial hypertension, all textbooks provided information regarding the purpose and benefit of exercise, six provided information regarding exercise prescription, nine provided information regarding the type of exercise. two provided information regarding general care and recommendations, and seven provided information regarding the mechanisms involved. All textbooks analyzed contained information related to physical exercise for patients with T2DM and arterial hypertension. however, the textbooks differed in terms of the quality of the contents, especially in regard to exercise prescription.

   IMPACT
AB Human physiology is a core physical sciences course for health professions students, such as nurses and exercise science majors. The concepts of human physiology lay the foundation for health professions courses, such as pathophysiology. The National Council Licensing Exam for registered nurses (a timed nursing licensure exam) and the American College of Sports Medicine timed licensure exams for exercise sciences students have a framework consisting of human physiology concepts and are computer adaptive testing (CAT) assessments. This provides a case for electronic testing (in the undergraduate class setting) as a preparatory measure for CAT licensing exams. Case studies have illustrated a high information retention rate, with students completing online homework vs. paper, as well. Additionally, in recent years, virtual laboratories for nonphysical science majors have been described as safer and effective for the purposes of educating students in laboratory techniques and experimental measures. Lastly, a successful learning approach utilized by museums has been found to be effective in younger students as well: "touch learning" (tactile learning). It also is important to note that student discussions and the face-to-face teaching dynamic play a critical role in the undergraduate education process. As such, the teaching methodology discussed here combines e-learning, virtual laboratories, tactile learning, and face-to-face didactic instruction of human physiology in developing a course to engage undergraduate health professions students, increase retention of human physiology course materials, and simultaneously prepare students for the CAT assessments that are licensing exams.

ID PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
AB Since 2005, nearly 600 Physiology Understanding Week (PhUn Week) events have taken place across the U.S., involving American Physiological Society (APS) members in K-12 outreach. The program seeks to build student understanding of physiology and physiology careers, assist teachers in recognizing physiology in their standards-based curriculum, and involve more physiologists in K-12 outreach. Formative goals included program growth (sites, participants, and leaders), diversification of program models, and development of a community of practice of physiologists and trainees involved in outreach. Eleven years of member-provided data indicate that the formative goals are being met. Nearly 100,000 K-12 students have been reached during the last decade as an increasing pool of physiologists took part in a growing number of events, including a number of international events. The number and types of PhUn Week events have steadily increased as a community of practice has formed to support the program. Future program goals include targeting regional areas for PhUn Week participation, establishing research collaboratives to further explore program impacts, and providing on-demand training for physiologists.

FU APS Council
FX Many persons contributed to the development of the PhUn Week program,
   including both APS members and staff. APS K-12 program coordinators
   Kathleen Kelly Ngo and Melvin Limson were instrumental in the initial
   development of program structure and resources. Members of the APS
   Education Committee and Career Opportunities in Physiology Committee
   over the 10 yr of the program helped develop the program goals,
   initiated requests for funding from the APS Council, and provided
   oversight of program evaluation. The authors especially thank the APS
   Council and APS Executive Director, Martin Frank, for leadership in
   supporting K-12 outreach as an APS priority. We thank ADInstruments for
   support of the annual PhUn Week training session at EB. Finally, PhUn
   Week is truly a grassroots effort. This paper reflects the contributions
   of hundreds of physiologists, trainees, K-12 teachers, and school
   leaders who want students to understand the excitement and importance of
   scientific research.

AB Basic cardiac electrophysiology is foundational to understanding normal cardiac function in terms of rate and rhythm and initiation of cardiac muscle contraction. The primary clinical tool for assessing cardiac electrical events is the electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides global and regional information on rate, rhythm, and electrical conduction as well as changes in electrical activity associated with cardiac disease, particularly ischemic heart disease. This teaching review is written at a level appropriate for first- and second-year medical students. Specific concepts discussed include ion equilibrium potentials, electrochemical forces driving ion movements across membranes, the role of ion channels in determining membrane resting potentials and action potentials, and the conduction of action potentials within the heart. The electrophysiological basis for the ECG is then described, followed by discussion on how ischemia alters cellular electrophysiology and ECG recordings, with particular emphasis on changes in T waves and ST segments of the ECG.

AB Total body potassium content and proper distribution of potassium across the cell membrane is of critical importance for normal cellular function. Potassium homeostasis is maintained by several different methods. In the kidney, total body potassium content is achieved by alterations in renal excretion of potassium in response to variations in intake. Insulin and beta-adrenergic tone play critical roles in maintaining the internal distribution of potassium under normal conditions. Despite homeostatic pathways designed to maintain potassium levels within the normal range, disorders of altered potassium homeostasis are common. The clinical approach to designing effective treatments relies on understanding the pathophysiology and regulatory influences which govern the internal distribution and external balance of potassium. Here we provide an overview of the key regulatory aspects of normal potassium physiology. This review is designed to provide an overview of potassium homeostasis as well as provide references of seminal papers to guide the reader into a more in depth discussion of the importance of potassium balance. This review is designed to be a resource for educators and well-informed clinicians who are teaching trainees about the importance of potassium balance.

AB Faculty members in higher education are involved in many instructional design activities without formal training in learning theories and the science of instruction. Learning theories provide the foundation for the selection of instructional strategies and allow for reliable prediction of their effectiveness. To achieve effective learning outcomes, the science of instruction and instructional design models are used to guide the development of instructional design strategies that elicit appropriate cognitive processes. Here, the major learning theories are discussed and selected examples of instructional design models are explained. The main objective of this article is to present the science of learning and instruction as theoretical evidence for the design and delivery of instructional materials. In addition, this article provides a practical framework for implementing those theories in the classroom and laboratory.

ID PREFERENCES
AB PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) have become routine in medical colleges because of their flexible and varied presentation capabilities. Research indicates that students prefer PPTs over the chalk-and-talk method, and there is a lot of debate over advantages and disadvantages of PPTs. However, there is no clear evidence that PPTs improve student learning/performance. Furthermore, there are a variety of learning styles with sex differences in classrooms. It is the responsibility of teacher/facilitator and student to be aware of learning style preferences to improve learning. The present study asked the following research question: do PPTs equally affect the learning of students with different learning styles in a mixed sex classroom? After we assessed students' predominant learning style according to the sensory modality that one most prefers to use when learning, a test was conducted before and after a PPT to assess student performance. The results were analyzed using Student's t-test and ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test. A z-test showed no sex differences in preferred learning styles. There was significant increase in posttest performance compared with that of the pretest in all types of learners of both sexes. There was also a nonsignificant relationship among sex, learning style, and performance after the PPT. A PPT is equally effective for students with different learning style preferences and supports mixed sex classrooms.

AB Concept mapping and retrieval practice are both educational methods that have separately been reported to provide significant benefits for learning in diverse settings. Concept mapping involves diagramming a hierarchical representation of relationships between distinct pieces of information, whereas retrieval practice involves retrieving information that was previously coded into memory. The relative benefits of these two methods have never been tested against each other in a classroom setting. Our study was designed to investigate whether or not concept mapping or retrieval practice produced a significant learning benefit in an undergraduate physiology course as measured by exam performance and, if so, was the benefit of one method significantly greater than the other. We found that there was a trend toward increased exam scores for the retrieval practice group compared with both the control group and concept mapping group, and that trend achieved statistical significance for one of the four module exams in the course. We also found that women performed statistically better than men on the module exam that contained a substantial amount of material relating to female reproductive physiology.

AB Skeletal muscle contraction is associated with the production of ROS due to altered O-2 distribution and flux in the cell. Despite a highly efficient antioxidant defense, a small surplus of ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, may serve as signaling molecules to stimulate cellular adaptation to reach new homeostasis largely due to the activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways. Recent research has highlighted the important role of NF-kappa B, MAPK, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha, along with other newly discovered signaling pathways, in some of the most vital biological functions, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defense, inflammation, protein turnover, apoptosis, and autophagy. There is evidence that the inability of the cell to maintain proper redox signaling underlies some basic mechanisms of biological aging, during which inflammatory and catabolic pathways eventually predominate. Physical exercise has been shown to activate various redox signaling pathways that control the adaptation and remodeling process. Although this stimulatory effect of exercise declines with aging, it is not completed abolished. Thus, aged people can still benefit from regular physical activity in the appropriate forms and at proper intensity to preserve muscle function.

AB Engagement of academic medical centers in community outreach provides the public with a better understanding of basic terms and concepts used in biomedical sciences and increases awareness of important health information. Medical students at one academic medical center initiated an educational outreach program, called PULSE, that targets secondary students to foster their interest in healthcare and medicine. High school student participants are engaged in a semester-long course that relies on interactive lectures, problem-based learning sessions, mentoring relationships with medical students, and opportunities for shadowing healthcare providers. To date, the curriculum has been offered for 7 consecutive years. To determine the impact that participation in the curriculum has had on college/career choices and to identify areas for improvement, an electronic questionnaire was sent to former participants. Based on a 32% response rate, 81% of former participants indicated that participation in the course influenced their decision to pursue a medical/science-related career. More than half (67%) of respondents indicated intent to pursue a MD/PhD or other postgraduate degree. Based on responses obtained, additional opportunities to incorporate laboratory-based research and simulation sessions should be explored. In addition, a more formalized mentoring component has been added to the course to enhance communication between medical students and mentees. Health/medicine-related educational outreach programs targeting high school students may serve as a pipeline to introduce or reinforce career opportunities in healthcare and related sciences.

AB To modernize its stagnant, traditional curriculum and pedagogy, the Medical School of Wuhan University in China adopted (with modifications) the University of Chicago's medical curriculum model. The reform effort in basic sciences was integrating histology and physiology into one course, increasing the two subjects' connection to clinical medicine, and applying new pedagogies and assessment methods. This study assessed the results of the reform by comparing the attitudes and academic achievements of students in the reform curriculum (n = 41) and their traditional curriculum peers (n = 182). An attitude survey was conducted to obtain students' views of their respective histology and physiology instruction. Survey items covered lectures, laboratory teaching, case analyses and small-group case discussions, assessment of students, and overall quality of the courses and instruction. A knowledge test consisting of questions from three sources was given to measure students' mastery of topics that they had learned. Results showed that reform curriculum students were rather satisfied with their course and new teaching methods in most cases. When these students' attitudes were compared with those of their traditional curriculum peers, several significant differences favoring the reform were identified regarding physiology teaching. No other significant difference was found for physiology or histology teaching. Reform curriculum students outperformed their peers on four of five subcategories of the knowledge test questions. These findings support the benefits of integration and state-of-the-art teaching methods. Our study may offer lessons to medical schools in China and other countries whose medical education is in need of change.

AB Neural reflexes support homeostasis by modulating the function of organ systems. Recent advances in neuroscience and immunology have revealed that neural reflexes also regulate the immune system. Activation of the vagus nerve modulates leukocyte cytokine production and alleviates experimental shock and autoimmune disease, and recent data have suggested that vagus nerve stimulation can improve symptoms in human rheumatoid arthritis. These discoveries have generated an increased interest in bioelectronic medicine, i.e., therapeutic delivery of electrical impulses that activate nerves to regulate immune system function. Here, we discuss the physiology and potential therapeutic implications of neural immune control.

AB Puglisi JL, Negroni JA, Chen-Izu Y, Bers DM. The force-frequency relationship: insights from mathematical modeling. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 28-34, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00072.2011.-The force-frequency relationship has intrigued researchers since its discovery by Bowditch in 1871. Many attempts have been made to construct mathematical descriptions of this phenomenon, beginning with the simple formulation of Koch-Wesser and Blinks in 1963 to the most sophisticated ones of today. This property of cardiac muscle is amplified by beta-adrenergic stimulation, and, in a coordinated way, the neurohumoral state alters both frequency (acting on the sinoatrial node) as well as force generation (modifying ventricular myocytes). This synchronized tuning is needed to meet new metabolic demands. Cardiac modelers have already linked mechanical and electrical activity in their formulations and showed how those activities feedback on each other. However, now it is necessary to include neurological control to have a complete description of heart performance, especially when changes in frequency are involved. Study of arrhythmias (or antiarrhythmic drugs) based on mathematical models should incorporate this effect to make useful predictions or point out potential pharmaceutical targets.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 116-124, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00132.2010.-The student body at the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine (NRMSM) is very diverse, representing many cultures, religions, and languages. Research has shown that weakness in English can impact student performance. Recent studies have also highlighted sex-based differences in students' learning and listening styles. These factors pose both challenges and opportunities for teachers of physiology. Student presentations were incorporated for a number of years into the traditional didactic second-year medical physiology curriculum at the NRMSM. Feedback obtained about the perceived benefits of these presentations for the learning of gastrointestinal and endocrine physiology included demographic data pertaining to students' sex, home language, and self-reported performance in tests. Analysis of the 50-item questionnaire responses, obtained over a 2-yr period, provided some interesting insights. Student responses to the items differed significantly in 27 of the 50 items in the questionnaire, based on sex alone (22%), sex and home language (7%), home language alone (37%), performance alone (26%), and performance and home language (7%). Our analyses of student perceptions support the findings of other studies and show that factors such as sex, home language, and student performance can play an important role in the way students are motivated to learn. In designing active learning strategies, academics need to take into account the potential influences that might affect student learning in diverse, multicultural, and multilingual classes.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 154-157, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00080.2011.-This article describes a laboratory protocol for a multiweek project piloted in a new upper-level biology laboratory (BIO 426) using cell culture techniques. Human embryonic kidney-293 cells were used, and several culture media and supplements were identified for students to design their own experiments. Treatments included amino acids, EGF, caffeine, epinephrine, heavy metals, and FBS. Students researched primary literature to determine their experimental variables, made their own solutions, and treated their cells over a period of 2 wk. Before this, a sterile technique laboratory was developed to teach students how to work with the cells and minimize contamination. Students designed their experiments, mixed their solutions, seeded their cells, and treated them with their control and experimental media. Students had the choice of manipulating a number of variables, including incubation times, exposure to treatment media, and temperature. At the end of the experiment, students observed the effects of their treatment, harvested and dyed their cells, counted relative cell numbers in control and treatment flasks, and determined the ratio of living to dead cells using a hemocytometer. At the conclusion of the experiment, students presented their findings in a poster presentation. This laboratory can be expanded or adapted to include additional cell lines and treatments. The ability to design and implement their own experiments has been shown to increase student engagement in the biology-related laboratory activities as well as develop the critical thinking skills needed for independent research.

AB There remains a clear deficiency in recruiting middle school students in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine fields, especially for those students entering physiology from underrepresented backgrounds. A large part of this may be arising from a disconnect between how science is typically practiced at a collegiate and K-12 level. Here, we have envisioned mitochondria and their diverse subcellular structures as an involver for middle school students. We present the framework for a workshop that familiarizes students with mitochondria, employing three-dimensional visual-spatial learning and real-time critical thinking and hypothesis forming. This workshop had the goal of familiarizing middle school students with the unique challenges the field currently faces and better understanding the actuality of being a scientist through critical analysis including hypothesis forming. Findings show that middle school students responded positively to the program and felt as though they had a better understanding of mitochondria. Future implications for hands-on programs to involve underrepresented students in science are discussed, as well as potential considerations to adapt it for high school and undergraduate students.

AB The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools around the world to adopt emergency remote learning as a resort to avoid interruption of courses. However, the effectiveness of online classes as an educational strategy has been questioned by medical educators and students. In a prospective observational study design, students enrolled in a renal physiology and pathophysiology course were exposed to either face-to-face or remote synchronous classes. Students taught online obtained significantly higher mean scores than the group who had in-person classes, both groups assessed with identical exams. Appropriate screening tests suggested that fraud is unlikely to have significantly influenced these results and that the observed differences in performance reflected increased learning by the remote group. These observations suggest that online classes can help to maintain the continuity of physiology and pathophysiology courses during periods of social isolation and may contribute to improving learning under normal conditions.

TI Teaching science with the "universal language" of music: alignment with
   the Universal Design for Learning framework
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article

ID STUDENTS; BIOLOGY
AB The idea of teaching science through music has undeniable appeal in implying that learning can be engaging and fun while also covering content efficiently. Indeed, there is little doubt that songs can be uniquely memorable, suggesting mnemonic options for core content. However, many classroom implementations of science music have limitations such as an overemphasis on rote memorization, rather than a constructivist building of understanding. In this brief review, we ask how music might facilitate the learning of science content in a manner consistent with the well-known pedagogical framework of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). In our view, UDL suggests certain distinct possible benefits of incorporating music into curricula, leading us to propose four models of practice. These four models are as follows: 1) students enjoy music together, 2) students critically analyze songs as texts, 3) students creatively augment existing songs, and 4) students create new songs. Model 1 can contribute to an inclusive learning environment, while models 2- 4 can encourage cognitively rich active learning, and models 3-4 can additionally help students channel scientific understanding into the creation of authentic products. We conclude with comments on logistical issues that arise in implementing these four models, including the use of appropriate rubrics and the prioritization of artistic quality.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Instructors and students often find it fun to incorporate music into science classes. However, the casual usage of music in this context can unintentionally convey that science courses are mostly about memorizing scientific facts. In this article, the authors argue for a more nuanced approach to teaching science with music, rooted in Universal Design for Learning (UDL).

Unfortunately, a fundamental flaw has crept into the core concept of flow down gradients. Fluids do not generally flow from high to low pressure, as claimed, but only because of a specific pressure difference, that is, the perfusion pressure. This is related to a problem that is widespread in physiology, from which even the core concepts are not free, namely, the description of mean arterial pressure (MAP) solely by means of Ohm's law of circulation, although this law actually describes perfusion pressure. Both pressures can be numerically approximately equal in the physiological case, but conceptually they remain different in principle. We solved this problem using the extended Bernoulli equation (a combination of Ohm's law and the simple Bernoulli equation). Thereafter, MAP depends on the following pressure components, all of which are essential for a basic understanding of circulation: perfusion, central venous, gravitational, and dynamic pressures. These pressures also have great pathophysiological and clinical importance, which we exemplify here. Toward the end of this article, we provide recommendations that should be considered in teaching, whether it is a beginner or advanced course. We address physiology teachers who are open to critical constructive improvements in their teaching, especially in hemodynamics. In particular, we encourage the authors of the flow down gradients core concept to improve and refine its "unpacking."

AB The basis for mastering neurophysiology is understanding ion movement across cell membranes. The Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device (EGAD) is a 17-item test assessing students' understanding of fundamental concepts of neurophysiology, e.g., electrochemical gradients and resistance, synaptic transmission, and stimulus strength. We collected responses to the EGAD from 534 students from seven institutions nationwide, before and after instruction. We determined the relative difficulty of neurophysiology topics and noted that students did better on "what" questions compared to "how" questions, particularly those integrating concentration gradient and electric forces to predict ion movement. We also found that, even after instruction, stu-dents selected one incorrect answer, at a rate greater than random chance for nine questions. We termed these incorrect answers attractive distractors. Most attractive distractors contained terms associated with concentration gradients, equilibrium, or anthropomorphic and teleological reasoning, and incorrect answers containing multiple terms were more attractive. We used v2 analysis and alluvial diagrams to investigate how individual students moved or did not move between answer choices on the pre-and posttest. Interestingly, students selecting the attractive distractor on the pretest were just as likely as other incorrect students to move to the correct answer on the posttest. In contrast, of students incorrect on both the pre-and posttest, students who selected the attractive distractor on the pretest were more likely to stick with this answer on the posttest than students choosing other incorrect answers. Combining the EGAD results with alluvial diagrams can inform neurophysiology instruction to address points of student confusion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Investigating students' alternative reasoning in neurophysiology, this research is the first to investigate how analyzing the most common incorrect answer can shed light on the concepts students struggle with when reasoning about neurophysiological problems, especially those dealing with both chemical and electrical driving forces to predict ion movement across cell membranes.

AB Developing engaging activities that build skills for understanding and appreciating research is important for undergraduate and postgraduate science students. Comparing and contrasting opposing research studies does this, and more: it also appropriately for these cohorts challenges higher level cognitive processing. Here, we present and discuss one such scenario, that of calcineurin in the heart and its response to exercise training. This scenario is further accentuated by the existence of only two studies. The background is that regular aerobic endurance exercise training stimulates the heart to physiologically adapt to chronically increase its ability to produce a greater cardiac output to meet the increased demand for oxygenated blood in working muscles, and this happens by two main mechanisms: 1) increased cardiac contractile function and 2) physiologic hypertrophy. The major underlying mechanisms have been delineated over the last decades, but one aspect has not been resolved: the potential role of calcineurin in modulating physiologic hypertrophy. This is partly because the existing research has provided opposing and contrasting findings, one line showing that exercise training does activate cardiac calcineurin in conjunction with myocardial hypertrophy, but another line showing that exercise training does not activate cardiac calcineurin even if myocardial hypertrophy is blatantly occurring. Here, we review and present the current evidence in the field and discuss reasons for this controversy. We present real-life examples from physiology research and discuss how this may enhance student engagement and participation, widen the scope of learning, and thereby also further facilitate higher level cognitive processing.

AB Students' preferences and engagement with online educational resources and activities are crucial for academic success in the context of online medical education. This study investigated the preferences of Chinese medical students regarding the teaching strategies used by instructors and their relationship with course difficulty level, student's academic performance, and perceived effectiveness. Survey data (n = 375) were collected from the medical students from one of the largest medical schools in Southern China during the spring semester of 2020. First, exploratory factor analysis demonstrated that there were three latent factors behind online teaching strategies, including teacher-led instructional strategies, supervised and monitored learning strategies, and self-directed learning strategies. Instructional activities under teacher supervision and monitoring received the highest rating while teacher-led strategies received the lowest ratings. Second, the popularity of the three online instructional strategies we have identified was positively associated with students' perceived effectiveness of online teaching and their self-reported academic performance. Third, analysis of the quantified answers to the open-ended question reported a positive association between the perceived difficulty level of the courses and students' preference of teacher-led strategies. It also manifested a positive correlation between perceived effectiveness level of the online teaching and the use of self-directed learning strategies before their online lectures. Further implications of the findings are fully discussed.

TI Using the "Hallmarks of Cancer" as a framework for medical students and
   clinicians to understand oncogenesis
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE hallmarks; cancer; oncogenesis; facilitator
AB Two landmark reviews in 2000 and 2011, describing the "Hallmarks of Cancer", provided a new and valuable framework for understanding the process of oncogenesis as a progressive accumulation of characteristics, each characteristic essential for a tumor to become a clinically relevant, metastatic neoplasia. The process of oncogenesis is conceptually important for physicians, both for clinical reasons, and for their engagement in oncological research. However, these reviews are written for specialists in the field, which presents barriers for novice learners. Therefore, to allow students, and also clinicians external to the oncological field, to access this valuable framework for understanding oncogenesis, we have created a condensed summary of the original reviews. Our institutions use a "flipped" approach to the large-group components of our preclinical education. We have successfully used our Hallmarks of Cancer summary as the prework for sessions on oncogenesis for five years at one institution, and nine years at the other, typically at the end of cancer blocks within integrated, multidisciplinary courses. We report here survey results indicating learners strongly appreciate the summary as both preparation material for participation in relevant flipped classroom sessions, and as a general review of oncogenesis. This condensed summary of the original Hallmarks of Cancer reviews makes many of the key concepts of oncogenesis available to medical students in their preclinical years, as well as to physicians outside the field of oncology.

TI Critical skill of teaching: learning the cognitive and emotional states
   of our students during class
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Letter
AB There has been an increased reliance on prerecorded lectures as a source of learning in place of live lectures in higher education. However, we must appreciate that our students send countless intended and unintended messages during class that relate to their cognitive and emotional states. Shaping productive learning experiences requires understanding their cognitive and emotional states by interpreting their statements, actions, and body language in real time. This can only occur with face-to-face instruction and makes it possible to tailor the class to the students' needs. Becoming aware of the students' cognitive and emotional state by listening and learning their body language is fundamental to teaching, as it will alert educators to cognitive effort and attention, surprise, or uncertainty, as well as a range of emotions, including confusion. Without an understanding of the students cognitive and emotional states, we lose our ability to structure conversations or to reinforce difficult concepts and important ideas in real time. We also lose our ability to adjust on the fly and modify instruction on the basis of the needs of our students. Thus, learning the cognitive and emotional states of our students during class is an essential skill of teaching and the critical means that a teacher uses to promote understanding and positive attitudes about education.

AB Online resources are becoming increasingly important in undergraduate education and have been associated with a number of advantages and positive outcomes on students' learning experience. However, online resource use by veterinary students for physiology learning remains poorly understood. Thus the present questionnaire-based study aims to investigate the extent to which first- and second-year veterinary students use online resources, including online video clips and social media, in their physiology learning and if this is influenced by factors of age, gender, entry status, or year of study. One-hundred and twenty-two students across seven UK universities completed the survey. Traditional resources (the lecturer and recommended textbooks) were the most preferred sources for physiology learning. Nonetheless, 97.5% of students used Internet search engines to explore physiology topics. Furthermore, students' tendency to contact their instructor regarding a physiology question was low. Rather, 92.6% said they would first search for an answer online. Particularly popular was the use of online video clips with 91.1% finding them valuable for physiology learning and 34.21% finding them more useful for understanding physiology than university taught material or lecture slides. YouTube was the most common online video clip platform used by students. Most students stated that they would enjoy interacting with course materials on an instructor-led social media page, but only 33.9% currently use social media to discuss physiology-related issues with classmates. Additionally, most students expressed concerns regarding the reliability of online resources but attempts to fact-check these resources were relatively low. Therefore, online resources represent an essential part of veterinary students' physiology learning and this suggests that educators can significantly improve student engagement and understanding of physiology by integrating these resources.

AB In 2011, we published a description of 15 core concepts of physiology, and in 2017 we described how core concepts could be used to teach physiology. On the basis of publications and conference presentations, it is clear that the core concepts, conceptual frameworks, and the homeostasis concept inventory have been used by faculty in many ways to improve and assess student learning and align instruction and programs. A growing number of colleagues focus their teaching on physiology core concepts, and some core concepts have been used as explicit themes or organizing principles in physiology or anatomy and physiology textbooks. The core concepts published in 2011 were derived from inputs from a diverse group of physiology instructors and articulated what this group of instructors expressed a decade ago. On the basis of current feedback from the physiology teaching community as a consequence of the use of core concepts in teaching and learning, we have revisited these concepts and made revisions to address issues that have emerged. In this article, we offer revised definitions and explanations of the core concepts, propose an additional core concept ("physical properties of matter" which combines two previous concepts), and describe three broad categories for the revised core concepts. Finally, we catalog published resources for each of the core concepts that provide instructors tools to focus facilitation of student learning on goals (learning outcomes), activities and assessments to enable students to develop and apply their understanding of the core concepts of physiology.

AB Unlike other STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) disciplines, program guidelines for undergraduate physiology degree programs have yet to be firmly established. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of physiology core concepts within undergraduate physiology curricula to discern whether a common subset could be broadly recommended for inclusion in programmatic guidelines. A curricular survey tool was developed to evaluate the depth to which each core concept was included in physiology curricula. Seven self-selected physiology programs assessed core concept inclusion across all courses within the major (0 = not covered, 1 = minimally covered, and 2 = covered to a great extent). The top core concepts ranked by each institution varied considerably, but all were robustly represented across programs. The top five combined rankings for all institutions were as follows: 1) interdependence (1.47 +/- 0.63); 2) structure/function (1.46 +/- 0.72); 3) homeostasis (1.45 +/- 0.71); 4) scientific reasoning (1.44 +/- 0.70); and 5) cell-cell communication (1.38 +/- 0.75). No common subset of specific core concepts was evident among the seven participating institutions. Next, results were compared with recent Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG) faculty and student surveys that ascertained perceptions of the top five most important core concepts. Three core concepts (homeostasis, structure/function, cell-cell communication) appeared in the top five in more than one-half of survey questions included. We recommend that future programmatic guidelines focus on inclusion of the core concepts of physiology as general models to scaffold learning in physiology curricula, but the programmatic guidelines should allow flexibility in the core concepts emphasized based on program objectives.

AB The integrated mechanisms of heart contraction are some of the most complex processes for undergraduate biomedical students to understand. Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students' drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen's kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course. Our results indicate that using AR enhances the comprehension of anatomical and physiological concepts of the cardiac cycle for under-graduate biomedical students.

AB Using a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning lens, this study systematically examined if a targeted intervention in at-risk students within a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)based physiology program would elicit positive student perceptions and higher retention rates into the second year. Those students who were considered at risk for attrition (retention; n = 82) were compared against a control group (non-retention; n = 165), and outcomes were evaluated with an End-of-Semester Survey and university enrollment data. Students in the retention group reported more favorable responses to questions pertaining to a first-year seminar course and academic advising. By the start of the following (spring 2019) semester, 48 students transferred out of the program (20%) with little difference between groups (non-retention 19%; retention 22%). At the start of fall 2019 term, 55% of the 2018 freshman class were retained within the program (non-retention 66%; retention 39%), and 85% were retained within the university (non-retention 91%, retention 74%). The intervention was successful in eliciting positive student perceptions of the major, but did not improve retention of at-risk students within the physiology major.

AB College biology courses commonly use diagrams to convey information. These visual representations are embedded in course materials with the expectation that students can comprehend and learn from them. Educational research, however, suggests that many students have difficulty understanding diagrams and the conventions (e.g.. labels. arrows) they contain. The present study evaluates biology students' ability to comprehend scientific diagrams and the diagram characteristics that affect this comprehension. Participants were students in a physiology course who completed a multiple-choice test of diagram comprehension ability (DCA) (Cromley JG. Perez TC, Fitzhugh SL. Newcombe NS, Wills TW, Tanaka JC. J Exp Educ 81: 511-537. 2013). We coded the conventions used in each test diagram and used these codes to capture the diagram characteristics of conventions and complexity. Descriptive analyses examine students' ability to understand scientific diagrams and which diagram characteristics cause the most difficulty. We also compared groups with low and high DCA scores to evaluate how students at different levels of comprehension ability are affected by diagram characteristics. Results show relatively poor DCA; the average total test score was only 69.5%. The conventions used in a diagram also affected diagram comprehension, and results show students had the most difficulty comprehending diagrams using a letter or numbering system, where arbitrary letters/numbers were used to signify objects and diagrams using cut-outs that showed cross sections and magnified interior views. Additionally, students' comprehension was higher on diagrams with higher complexity (i.e., more types of conventions used), potentially indicating students are able to take advantage of the supports that different conventions provide. Implications for instruction are identified.

ID BODY-COMPOSITION; SCIENCE
AB Research in the health sciences devotes much attention to overweight and obesity and, consequently, to body composition. In recent years, traditional body measures have been questioned as efficient variables in health sciences due to the fact that they cannot give information about body fat mass. Our aim is to teach how to analyze body composition through anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis to our "Physiology of Vegetative and Reproductive Functions" students, who are studying for their degree in Biology. We proposed project-oriented-learning to promote collaborative interactions among students. Fifty-two students voluntarily formed five groups; they worked with the concepts of basal metabolic rate and body composition from a theoretical point of view and later transformed these concepts into a practical perspective by preparing a manuscript in groups with objectives proposed by our teaching team. In this research, we show a collaborative educational scenario for university students in which students are tutored from a constructivist perspective to promote social interactions, resulting in new knowledge acquisition.

AB The educators have underlined the importance of lecture attendance for decades. Nowadays, students have ample online educational sources, which began a debate on the necessity of in-class lectures. In the present study, we investigated the influence of lecture attendance on the exam success. To this aim, we adopted a novel approach and matched second-year medicine students' answers in three interim exams with the lectures related to those questions. Thereby, we were able to evaluate if attending lectures increases the chance of giving a correct answer to the exam question generated from the attended lecture. Furthermore, we examined students who had never taken the course before ( first-time takers) and students who had failed and repeated the course ( repeat takers) separately, since repeat takers may have attended a lecture previously. We found that first-time takers attended more lectures and gained higher total scores than repeat takers. Lecture-matched correct answers were significantly higher for attended lectures than for skipped lectures in all interim exams. Moreover, the correlation analyses revealed that the number of correct answers increases by lecture attendance in both first-time and repeat takers. These results indicate that in-class lectures still should be considered as an essential part of the medical physiology education, even in the internet era.

AB Using an educational data mining approach, first-year academic achievement of undergraduate nursing students, which included two compulsory courses in introductory human anatomy and physiology, was compared with achievement in a final semester course that transitioned students into the workplace. We hypothesized that students could be grouped according to their first-year academic achievement using a two-step cluster analysis method and that grades achieved in the human anatomy and physiology courses would be strong predictors of overall achievement. One cohort that graduated in 2014 (n = 105) and one that graduated in 2015 (n = 94) were analyzed separately, and for both cohorts, two groups were identified, these being "high achievers" (HIGH) and "low achievers" (LOW). Consistently, the anatomy and physiology courses were the strongest predictors of group assignment, such that a good grade in these was much more likely to put a student into a high-achieving group. Students in the HIGH groups also scored higher in the Transition to Nursing course when compared with students in the LOW groups. The higher predictor importance of the anatomy and physiology courses suggested that if a first-year gradepoint average was calculated for students, an increased weighting should be attributed to these courses. Identifying high-achieving students based on first-year academic scores may be a useful method to predict future academic performance.

AB The chick embryo cardiomyocyte model of cell culture is a staple technique in many physiology and pharmacology laboratories. Despite the relative simplicity, robustness, and reproducibility inherent in this model, it can be used in a variety of ways to yield important new insights that help facilitate student understanding of underlying physiological and pharmacological concepts as well as, more generally, the scientific method. Using this model, this paper will show real data obtained by undergraduate students in the authors' laboratories. It will first demonstrate classical pharmacological concepts such as full and partial agonism, inverse agonism, and competitive reversible antagonism and then move on to more complex pharmacology involving the characterization of novel receptors in these cells.

AB Teaching of pathophysiology concepts is a core feature in health professional programs, but it can be challenging in undergraduate medical/biomedical science education, which is often highly theoretical when delivered by lectures and pen-and-paper tutorials. Authentic case studies allow students to apply their theoretical knowledge but still require good imagination on the part of the students. Lecture content can be reinforced through practical learning experiences in clinical environments. In this study, we report a new approach using clinical simulation within a Human Pathophysiology course to enable undergraduate science students to see "pathophysiology in action" in a clinical setting. Students role played health professionals, and, in these roles, they were able to interact with each other and the manikin "patient," take a medical history, perform a physical examination and consider relevant treatments. Evaluation of students' experiences suggests that using clinical simulation to deliver case studies is more effective than traditional paper-based case studies by encouraging active learning and improving the understanding of physiological concepts.

AB The properties of blood and the relative ease of access to which it can be retrieved make it an ideal source to gauge different aspects of homeostasis within an individual, form an accurate diagnosis, and formulate an appropriate treatment regime. Tests used to determine blood parameters such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, bleeding and clotting times, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean cell volume, and determination of blood groups are routinely used clinically, and deviations outside the normal range can indicate a range of conditions such as anemia, pregnancy, dehydration, overhydration, infectious disease, cancer, thyroid disease, and autoimmune conditions, to mention a few. As these tests can be performed relatively inexpensively and do not require high levels of technical expertise, they are ideally suited for use in the teaching laboratory, enabling undergraduate students to link theory to practice. The practicals described here permit students to examine their own blood and that of their peers and compare these with clinically accepted normal ranges. At the end of the practicals, students are required to answer a number of questions about their findings and to link abnormal values to possible pathological conditions by answering a series of questions based on their findings.

AB Review quizzes can provide students with feedback and assist in the preparation for in-class tests, but students often do not voluntarily use self-testing resources. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if taking a mandatory online review quiz alters performance on subsequent in-class tests. During two semesters of a single-semester introductory anatomy and physiology course, students were required to complete brief online quizzes after each textbook chapter had been covered during lecture as well as the day before an in-class test. During the next two semesters, students were not required to take the online review quizzes. Overall scores on chapter specific in-class tests were higher (P < 0.05) during the semesters in which students took online review quizzes (82.9 +/- 14.3%) compared with when they did not (78.7 +/- 15.5%), but all in-class tests were not improved. Scores on comprehensive midterm examinations were higher (83.0 +/- 12.9% vs. 78.9 +/- 13.7%, P < 0.05) but not on final examinations (72.4 +/- 13.8% vs. 71.8 +/- 14.0%) between those with online review quizzes and those without, respectively. Overall scores on in-class tests and comprehensive examinations were higher (P < 0.05) during the semesters in which students took online review quizzes (83.4 +/- 16.8%) compared with when they did not (80.3 +/- 17.6%). These data suggest that an online review quiz taken the day before an in-class test increases performance on some in-class tests. However, online review quizzes taken after completion of each chapter do not consistently enhance performance on comprehensive examinations.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 313-318, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00132.2011.-In this report, we present a practical approach to teaching several topics in nutrition to science students at the high school and college freshmen levels. This approach uses baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a biological system model. The diameters of yeast colonies, which vary according to the nutrients present in the medium, can be observed, compared, and used to teach metabolic requirements. The experiments described in this report show simple macroscopic evidence of submicroscopic nutritional events. This can serve as a useful base for an analogy of heterotrophic human cell nutrition.

AB Jackson TA, Evans DJ. Can medical students teach? A near-peer-led teaching program for year 1 students. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 192-196, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00035.2012.-The General Medical Council states that United Kingdom graduates must function effectively as educators. There is a growing body of evidence showing that medical students can be included as teachers within a medical curriculum. Our aim was to design and implement a near-peer-led teaching program in an undergraduate medical curriculum and assess its acceptability among year 1 students. Students received six tutorials focusing on aspects of cardiac, respiratory, and blood physiology. Tutorials ran alongside standard module teaching. Students were taught in groups of similar to 30 students/group, and an active teaching approach was used in sessions where possible. Using anonymous evaluations, student feedback was collected for the program overall and for each tutorial. The program was voluntary and open to all first-year students, and 94 (of 138) medical students from year 1 at Brighton and Sussex Medical School were recruited to the study. The tutorial program was popular among students and was well attended throughout. Individual tutorial and overall program quantitative and qualitative feedback showed that students found the tutorials very useful in consolidating material taught within the module. Students found the small group and active teaching style of the near-peer tutors very useful to facilitating their learning experience. The end-of-module written examination scores suggest that the tutorials may have had a positive effect on student outcome compared with previous student attainment. In conclusion, the present study shows that a near-peer tutorial program can be successfully integrated into a teaching curriculum. The feedback demonstrates that year 1 students are both receptive and find the additional teaching of benefit.

AB Dobson JL. A comparison between learning style preferences and sex, status, and course performance. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 197-204, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00078.2010.-Students have learning style preferences that are often classified according to their visual (V), aural (A), read-write (R), and/or kinesthetic (K) sensory modality preferences (SMP). The purposes of this investigation were to compare student perceived and assessed SMPs and examine the associations between those SMPs and status (i.e., undergraduates vs. graduates), sex, and course performance. Students from the fall 2009 APK 3110 and APK 6116 Exercise Physiology courses were asked to indicate their perceived SMPs and complete the standard VARK SMP assessment. There were 64 student respondents: 50 undergraduates and 14 graduates (40 women and 24 men). According to the perceived SMP results, the largest number of respondents chose V (36%), followed by R (28%), K (19%), and A (17%). In terms of assessed SMPs, the largest number of respondents were classified as VARK (37%), followed by R (14%), AK (11%), K (8%), VK (6%), ARK (6%), A (5%), VAK (3%), RK (3%), V (2%), AR (2%), and VRK (2%). Nearly two-thirds of the respondents correctly matched their perceived and dominant assessed SMP. There was no statistical association between SMP and status. There was a very nearly significant relationship between sex and both perceived (chi(2) = 7.18, P = 0.06) and assessed (chi(2) = 17.36, P = 0.09) SMP. Finally, there was a significant relationship between perceived SMP and course scores (P = 0.01 by ANOVA). Post hoc tests revealed that the K group scored significantly lower than the other three modality groups.

AB Navalta JW, Lyons TS. Student peer review decisions on submitted manuscripts are as stringent as faculty peer reviewers. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 170-173, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00046.2010.-The International Journal of Exercise Science is the only student-centered peer-reviewed journal in its field. Upon graduate student first author submissions, two student reviewers and one faculty reviewer are asked to review. On professionally submitted papers, two faculty peers are asked to assess the manuscript. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether graduate students returned similar decisions compared with faculty reviewers who evaluated the same manuscript. In addition, decisions of faculty peers reviewing graduate student-versus faculty-submitted manuscripts were compared. Mean comparisons between groups were evaluated using independent t-tests with significance at P <= 0.05. Graduate students (2.21 +/- 0.69) and faculty peers (2.24 +/- 0.66) returned similar decisions on student-submitted manuscripts (P = 0.84). Faculty decisions on manuscripts submitted by a professional primary author (1.86 +/- 0.77) were not different compared with faculty peers reviewing student manuscripts (P = 0.06). Statistics revealed that graduate students are just as stringent in the peer review process as established reviewers. Additionally, faculty reviewers evaluated manuscripts equally regardless of submission type.

AB Ramirez BU. Effect of self-assessment on test scores: student perceptions. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 134-136, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00021.2010.-After a sudden increase in most of the individual grades in a multiple-choice test, students were asked to rank the three most relevant factors responsible for this outcome. Among eight others, the availability of a test for self-assessment before the final test was by far the most frequently mentioned (82.4% of the students). Questions applied during different course activities did not have the same effect on student scores as the "online" self-assessment test.

AB Higgins-Opitz SB, Tufts M. Student perceptions of the use of presentations as a method of learning endocrine and gastrointestinal pathophysiology. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 75-85, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00105.2009.-Second-year medical students at the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine (Durban, South Africa) were given a brief to prepare oral presentations on topics related to disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and endocrine system in the form of "patient-doctor" role play and to submit written documents about their topics. This initiative was introduced to assist medical students in their application and understanding of physiology to clinical situations. The aims of the student presentations were to improve the understanding of the physiological basis of diseases; promote independent research, active, and group-based learning; encourage social interactions; and develop presentation and peer review skills. Students rose to the challenge, producing a variety of presentations reflecting a wealth of creativity, humour, sensitivity to local cultural issues, and analytic thinking skills. The quality of the supporting posters and computer-generated slides was outstanding. Numerous "fun" prizes for specific individual and group performances were given based on peer and staff evaluations. This exercise ran over a 5-yr period before the introduction of a problem-based learning medical curriculum. Student feedback obtained over these years is reported here. Students were asked to complete semistructured questionnaires, which elicited feedback on various aspects of the learning exercise, including whether it should be continued and how it could be improved upon, especially if they were in groups that did not function well. The feedback obtained revealed that most students perceived the presentations to be fun, informative, creative/innovative, and, most importantly, beneficial to their learning. The majority of students felt that this exercise improved their understanding of pathophysiology, taught them to research independently, and encouraged better class interactions and group learning. The inclusion of such initiatives is beneficial not only to students' understanding and their experience in studying physiology but also for the development of skills useful in their future careers.

Adv Physiol Educ 34: 54-58, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00059.2009.-Recently, the use of animal laboratories has decreased in medical and basic science programs due to lack of trained faculty members, student concerns about animal welfare, and the increased availability of inexpensive alternatives such as computer simulations and videos. Animal laboratories, however, have several advantages over alternative forms of instruction, including an increased sense of learner responsibility, long-term psychomotor competency, and improved ability to examine functional relationships. While the use of animal laboratories has been studied in medical programs, it has not been examined in physical therapy or other allied health programs. The purposes of this study were to examine the attitudes of student physical therapists toward clinically relevant animal laboratories and to determine if student physical therapists felt that the laboratory modules prepared them for future course work and clinical internships. Written surveys completed by the study participants indicated that most students enjoyed the labs and believed that they helped prepare them for course examinations. Additionally, the majority of students believed that the laboratory modules helped them prepare for future course work and clinical internships.

AB A 3-year study (2017-2019) was conducted to obtain the views of nonmajor undergraduate students about discussions in learning physiology. The teaching methods used were lecture only (lecture), group discussion alone (discussion), and a combination of lecture and discussion (lecture + discussion). Students were assigned homework in a textbook, and they did not have access to textbook/notes during discussions. Under these conditions, 58% of students indicated that they learned best with lecture + discussion strategy, compared with 49% for lecture and 18% for discussion approaches. Remarkably, 61% of students said the discussion did not enhance learning; by comparison, 35% and 14% had the same views about lecture and lecture + discussion, respectively. Furthermore, if given the opportunity to choose a teaching/learning environment, 66% of students would select lecture + discussion, 33% would pick lecture, and only 6% would choose discussion setting. As many as 77% of students would reject the discussion setting if given the choice. The opinions of students were similar irrespective of their expected grades (whether A, B, or C); however, greater proportions of B or C students disliked discussion than A students. Thus, whereas 63% of A students disliked discussion, 81% of B students and 83% of C students disliked it. Also, 64% of students indicated that they would have been poorly prepared for classes without assigned homework. Essential outcomes of this study include undergraduates viewed the lecture + discussion setting as a supportive/desirable environment for learning physiology, and they consistently rated the lecture method higher than the discussion-only approach. Students did not relish learning physiology in a discussion-only setting. These findings may help in establishing teaching/learning environments from the student's perspective.

   metabolism; simplex learning index
AB Difficulty index and its derivative performance index (PFI) have been commonly used to measure student learning outcomes. However, these indexes have a high volatility and low sensitivity. This work has established the simplex learning index (SLI), which has a low volatility and high sensitivity. To construct SLI, students were divided into two groups based on their scores on the whole quiz. The item SLI and lecture SLI were derived from the results of students in the high-scoring group. Exam results from nine cohorts of medical students in two phases of learning were analyzed. The volatility, measured by the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean, was >65% lower in SLI than in PFI. Using the lecture SLI as a metric, one lecture B22 (Metabolism of Amino Acids), was identified that had an average SLI of 0.66 in earlier four student cohorts in phase 1 learning. Two major changes were made on the lecture, lecture organization and the delivery method, in phase 2. Students from recent five cohorts in phase 2 had an average SLI of 0.84, which was 26.6% higher than that in phase 1 (P < 0.02). In contrast, when PFI was used, the change was only 13.46% and insignificant (P = 0.29). In the same period, implementation of the same delivery method did not yield significant changes in learning outcomes in lecture B24 (Metabolism of Nucleotides). Taken together, this work shows that SLI is a better indicator for learning outcomes and suggests that lecture reorganization is the key to improved student learning.

AB Supplemental resources in science education are made available to students based on the belief that they will improve coursebased student learning. This belief is ubiquitous, with supplemental resources being a traditional component of physiology education. In addition, the recent large-scale transition to remote learning caused by the Covid-19 pandemic suggests an increased relevance and necessity of digital versions of supplemental resources. However, the use of a supplemental resource is entirely dependent on whether students view it as beneficial. If students in a specific course do not perceive a supplemental resource as useful, there is little reason to believe the resources will be used and are worthy of investment. Consequently, measurement of student perception regarding the effectiveness of any digital learning tool is essential for educators and institutions in order to prioritize resources and make meaningful recommendations to students. In this study, a survey was used to determine student perceptions of a digital, supplemental resource. Quantitative methods, including exploratory factor analysis, were performed on data collected from the survey to examine the dimensionality and functionality of this survey. The findings from this study were used to devise an improved, standardized (i.e., reliable and valid) survey that can be used and adapted by physi3ology researchers and educators to determine student perception of a digital supplemental resource. The survey, with known construct validity and internal reliability, can provide useful information for administrators, instructors, and designers of digital supplemental resources.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting "lockdown" have forced many medical schools to shift from traditional "face-to-face" teaching methodologies and embrace full online delivery. Although lectures and tutorials are readily communicated by this approach, the execution of laboratory exercises is much more difficult. To overcome these challenges, face-to-face laboratory sessions were replaced by a blended learning approach in which students were provided instructional material online and then required to conduct the laboratory exercises at home. These laboratory exercises made use of easily accessible household materials and mobile applications. A self-report survey was designed to assess students' perception of their learning experience and attitudes to the home-based laboratory exercises. The survey consisted of 16 questions that students had to respond to using a 5-point Likert scale. Students were also allowed to provide open responses to select questions. Overall, the 80% of students that completed the survey expressed strong satisfaction with their learning experience and were enthusiastic toward home-based laboratory exercises. However, concerns about not being able to complete particular face-to-face exercises that required specialized equipment were expressed. Several students proposed a combined approach going forward. Our results show that home-based laboratory exercises offer a multimodal option that enriches the learning curriculum by engaging students in "hands-on" bespoke practicals using inexpensive household materials.

AB Research on the extent and nature of commonly misunderstood fundamental biomedical concepts across a medical curriculum is scarce. These misunderstandings could point toward robust misconceptions. We examined first whether common misunderstandings persist throughout a medical curriculum, followed by a fine-grained analysis to identify their nature. We designed and administered a 2-tier test to 987 medical students across our curriculum, with 8 questions covering the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, cell division, and homeostatic processes. Proportions of incorrect responses were computed. Four questions where misunderstandings persisted were further qualitatively analyzed. A one-way ANOVA showed the proportion of incorrect responses decreased significantly by students' academic year [F(6, 986) = 96.05, P < 0.001]. While novices and end-of -first-year students showed similar proportion of incorrect responses (P > 0.05), incorrect responses decreased significantly between first years and second years (P < 0.001). Thereafter, the proportion of incorrect responses remained stable from second to final year (P > 0.05), with similar to 35% of incorrect responses. Five questions showed no decrease of incorrect responses between second and final years, with two questions where final year students performed marginally better than novices. A Chi-square analysis, with Bonferroni post hoc test, showed certain misunderstandings appeared frequently across the curriculum. The qualitative analysis of the open-ended questions yielded 15 categories of common misunderstandings of fundamental biomedical concepts in all years of training. If educators become aware of commonly misunderstood biomedical concepts, preventative measures could be taken to prevent robust misconceptions.

AB We describe an inquiry activity that aims to develop students' ability to interpret findings that span whole body systems and so encourage the integration of knowledge. The scenario we choose was the physiological challenge posed by diarrhea and the physiological mechanisms that underpin oral rehydration therapy. Before the staff-facilitated inquiry activity, students engage with an online information resource and complete a formative, but mandatory, prelaboratory quiz. These tasks encourage students to develop some mastery of the relevant physiology before the timetabled inquiry activity. The 3-h inquiry activity is driven by a paper workbook containing data from published studies, mainly from veterinary physiology, of the various consequences of diarrhea. Figures from published data are arranged so that, initially, the impact of dehydration on a single system (the cardiovascular system) could be appreciated. Integration with other systems (respiratory and renal systems) is then introduced progressively through the activity. The exercise is designed as a team-based inquiry activity that emphasizes the value of discussion to identify appropriate features for interpretation of the data. Students are obliged to complete a postlaboratory quiz within 5 days of the inquiry activity, serving to consolidate the students' learning and provide staff with feedback on the attainment of intended learning outcomes. Marks from formative pre- and postlaboratory quizzes typically have a median mark in excess of 80% (pass mark is 50%), and qualitative feedback suggests that the majority of students recognized the value of the activity, despite simultaneously reporting that it was intellectually demanding.

AB Although the teaching methods of the blended learning and BOPPPS (bridge-in, objective, preassessment, participatory learning, postassessment, and summary) model are proven to be successful and highly effective at improving the academic knowledge of the students, respectively, it is unclear whether blended learning combined with the BOPPPS model (BL-BOPPPS) could work well in an introduction course of health services management (HSM) for the health management students in China. The study investigated the perceptions and effects of implementing the BL-BOPPPS model on student learning outcomes in an introduction course of HSM. The intervention group consisted of 55 students introduced to the BL-BOPPPS model, while the control group consisted of 54 students who received a conventional lecture. After the end of course, the effectiveness of teaching was selfassessed with questionnaires by all students, and examination scores for the two groups were compared. The students' satisfaction levels of BL-BOPPPS teaching strategy were up to 81.8% in the intervention group. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant elevation of perception scores of skills (P = 0.001), initiative (P = 0.002), self-control (P = 0.008), self-efficacy (P = 0.001), motivation (P = 0.004), and the academic performance (P = 0.001). The BL-BOPPPS model could stimulate the enthusiasm and interest of health students; boost students' skills, initiative, and motivation in learning; and improve the self-directed learning ability, academic performance, and teaching quality. The findings provide a basis of evidence for the promotion of the BL-BOPPPS model in various disciplines in Chinese colleges and universities.

AB I describe a kinesthetic activity about oxygen handling by hemoglobin with two specific goals: 1) to help students gain a better understanding of how hemoglobin properties affect oxygen delivery and 2) to improve the ability of the students to actually read the hemoglobin oxygen-binding curve. The activity makes understanding oxygen delivery more intuitive, provides a kinesthetic analog to delivery of oxygen, and provides data to plot for the hemoglobin- oxygen curve.

AB We have created and validated a conceptual framework for the core physiology concept of "cell membrane." The conceptual framework is composed of 27 items arranged in a hierarchy that is, in some instances, four levels deep. We have validated it with input from faculty who teach at a wide variety of institutional types. All items making up the framework were deemed essential to moderately important. However, some of the main ideas were clearly judged to be more important than others. Furthermore, the lower in the hierarchy an item is located, the less important it is thought to be. Finally, there was no significant difference in the ratings given by faculty at different types of institutions.

AB High-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) is expensive in money and faculty resources. There has been a recent push to increase the use of HFPS for undergraduates to teach basic science. However, it is still unclear if HFPS is superior to other cost-effective modalities for learning, and there have been limited studies comparing HFPS directly with other methods. The purpose of this study was to compare learning between three groups: 1) students who participated in a HFPS after reading material (RS); 2) students who reread material (RR) individually; and 3) students who had no intervention or reading (CON). Quizzes (10 true/false questions) were given presimulation, immediately after the simulation (post-sun 1), and 1 wk later to all groups (post-sim 2). Ninety-seven undergraduate students consented to include their data in the study. All groups scored the same on the presimulation quiz (median of 6). The RR and RS scored significantly higher than the CON group on post-sim 1 (medians 8 vs. 6). All groups performed similarly on post-sim 2. A questionnaire also showed that students had increased perceived confidence about pathophysiology. These data suggest that a single-time use of HFPS for knowledge learning for undergraduate students is not more effective than other methods. Future studies need to determine whether increasing the number of HFPS and developing social learning networks could make HFPS more effective for undergraduates. Additionally, future studies should focus on soft skill development, such as confidence, critical thinking, and teamwork/communication skills, as opposed to knowledge acquisition.

ID ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE
AB Studies completed with undergraduate populations have shown that attendance positively correlates with academic performance. A marked decline in classroom attendance within medical school has recently been noticed with the availability of video capture of lectures and other online material. This study compares these in the era of online material. It took place during the second-year Gastrointestinal and Renal Systems module. Attendance was mandatory at team-based learning and case-based learning sessions on new material and voluntary at lectures (29 sessions) and case-based learning on material previously covered (9 sessions). Attendance was recorded prospectively. All lectures were recorded. and all related files were available to students online. Performance was based on a 118 multiple-choice question final examination. Students voluntarily completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The study group consisted of 78 students (68% of 114 total) of whom 48 completed the MSLQ. Mean attendance was 24%, with 33% of students attending none of the nonmandatory sessions. The median score on the final exam for participants was 86.0 (range: 28.8). High levels of self-efficacy and the ability to self-regulate effort were predictive of low attendance. Attendance was positively predicted by an orientation toward peer learning and help seeking. There was no correlation between the percentage of classes attended and performance on the final exam. We conclude that different facets of self-regulated learning predict attendance, with highly confident students being the least likely to attend, and that attendance at in-class sessions is no longer a good marker for performance.

AB Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This thirteenth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the log transformation, an established technique that rescales the actual observations from an experiment so that the assumptions of some statistical analysis are better met. A general assumption in statistics is that the variability of some response Y is homogeneous across groups or across some predictor variable X. If the variability-the standard deviation-varies in rough proportion to the mean value of Y, a log transformation can equalize the standard deviations. Moreover, if the actual observations from an experiment conform to a skewed distribution, then a log transformation can make the theoretical distribution of the sample mean more consistent with a normal distribution. This is important: the results of a one-sample t test are meaningful only if the theoretical distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal. If we log-transform our observations, then we want to confirm the transformation was useful. We can do this if we use the Box-Cox method, if we bootstrap the sample mean and the statistic t itself, and if we assess the residual plots from the statistical model of the actual and transformed sample observations.

AB Regenerative medicine is a novel discipline that both excites undergraduates and may be used as a vehicle to expose students to scientific concepts and opportunities. The goal of this article is to describe the implementation of a National Science Foundation-funded Targeted Infusion Project in which underrepresented minority undergraduates are exposed to laboratory-bench skills and summer research opportunities that they may not have encountered otherwise. A 3-wk infusion of laboratory-bench and data presentation skills, in the context of a regenerative medicine/bioengineering project, aimed to engage students and expose them to opportunities as summer researchers and teaching assistants. The infusion aimed to assess the extent to which students improved 1) attitudes toward laboratory-bench-based techniques, using attitudes toward science as a proxy; 2) perceptions of scientific inquiry; 3) intentions to engage in undergraduate research; and 4) intentions to persist in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related fields. Results indicate that the 3-wk infusion had no effect on science attitudes, but transcribed responses to structured interviews administered after the summer research experience indicated that students who completed summer research projects had positive experiences. Differences in intentions to engage in research were detected between groups of students in different STEM majors, in addition to differences in intentions to pursue a career in science. We describe the implementation of the infusion and briefly discuss quantitative outcomes. We conclude that infusion of laboratory-bench modules in the context of a regenerative medicine/ bioengineering project may play a small but important role in increasing (minority) participation and persistence in the STEM pipeline.

AB In our medical school, we changed from a lecture-based method to a team-based learning (TBL) method to teach "polyneuropathies" in the neurology clerkship starting from the 2014 to 2015 academic year. Real patients were used instead of written scenarios in TBL sessions. This study aimed to compare former lecture-based and the current TBL methods in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions. First, we determined in-class engagement and satisfaction of the students for the lectures given in the 2013-2014 academic year. The following year, besides the same criteria, we also determined individual (IRAT) and group readiness test (GRAT) scores in the TBL group. End-of-clerkship exam scores for both groups were recorded. Additionally, opinions of patients about their experiences throughout the TBL process were determined. One year later (2015 for lecture and 2016 for TBL), both groups sat for an MCQ test to determine their knowledge retention levels. We found no difference between groups regarding end-of-clerkship exam scores. The mean knowledge retention test score of the TBL group was significantly higher than that of the lecture group (5.85 +/- 1.74 vs. 3.28 +/- 1.70). The differences between IRAT, GRAT, and retention test scores in the TBL group were significant. The mean student satisfaction score on a five-point scale was 3.01 +/- 0.9 (median = 3) in the lecture group and 4.11 +/- 1.1 (median = 4) in the TBL group. Our results seem encouraging for use of TBL performed with real patients in neurology education to achieve better long-term knowledge retention and higher in-class engagement and student satisfaction.

ID SITUATIONAL INTEREST; SECONDARY-SCHOOL; PERFORMANCE
AB The laboratory has been given a central role in physiology education, and teachers report that it is motivating for students to undertake experimental work on live animals or measuring physiological responses on the students themselves. Since motivation is a critical variable for academic learning and achievement, then we must concern ourselves with questions that examine how students engage in laboratory work and persist at such activities. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how laboratory work influences student motivation in physiology. We administered the Lab Motivation Scale to assess our students' levels of interest, willingness to engage (effort), and confidence in understanding (self-efficacy). We also asked students about the role of laboratory work for their own learning and their experience in the physiology laboratory. Our results documented high levels of interest, effort, and self-efficacy among the students. Correlation analyses were performed on the three motivation scales and exam results, yet a significant correlation was only found between self-efficacy in laboratory work and academic performance at the final exam. However, almost all students reported that laboratory work was very important for learning difficult concepts and physiological processes (e.g., action potential), as the hands-on experiences gave a more concrete idea of the learning content and made the content easier to remember. These results have implications for classroom practice as biology students find laboratory exercises highly motivating, despite their different personal interests and subject preferences. This highlights the importance of not replacing laboratory work by other nonpractical approaches, for example, video demonstrations or computer simulations.

AB Doing peer review has been effectively implemented to help students develop critical reading and writing skills; however, its application in Human Physiology programs is limited. The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of peer review on Human Physiology majors' perceptions of their scientific literacy and writing skills. Students enrolled in the Scientific Writing course completed multiple writing assignments, including three revisions after receiving peer and instructor feedback. Students self-assessed their knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to science and writing in pre- and postcourse surveys (n = 26 with complete data). Seven survey items related to scientific literacy and writing skills impacted by peer review were selected for analysis. Scores on these survey items were summed to form a composite self-rating score. Responses to two questions regarding the most useful learning activities were submitted to frequency analysis. Mean postcourse scores for individual survey items and composite self-rating scores were significantly higher than precourse means (P < 0.05). Peer review was the most frequently noted among 21 learning activities for increasing scientific literacy and in the top 5 for improving writing skills. In conclusion, peer review is an effective teaching/learning approach for improving undergraduate Human Physiology majors' knowledge, skills, and attitudes regarding science and scientific writing.

TI Value of artisanal simulators to train veterinary students in performing

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE pericardial effusion; puncture; training
AB Pericardial effusion can lead to cardiac tamponade, which endangers an animal's life. Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis is used to remove abnormal liquid; however, it requires technical expertise. In veterinary medical education, the opportunity to teach this procedure to save lives during emergencies is rare; therefore, simulators are recommended for this practice. The present study aimed to create a model that can be made "at home" at low cost for ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis training and to gather feedback about this model through questionnaires given to the participants. Eighteen professionals and thirty-six students were introduced to the simulator in pairs. After the simulation training session, participants filled out the questionnaire. Participants considered the model strong in the following areas: visualization of the pericardium, the heart, fluid in the pericardium, and fluid decrease during fictitious pericardiocentesis and its realism. They considered the model weak or moderate in the following areas: visualization of the surrounding tissues, difficulty of pericardial puncture, and visualization of the catheter. The professionals classified the realism of the experimental heart as moderate, whereas the undergraduate students classified it as strong. All participants believed that the experimental model could be useful in preparing for a future real situation. This model fulfills the need for a practical, realistic, and cost-effective model for ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis training.

AB Making the transition from more traditional to more interactive lecturing can be successfully achieved by applying numerous teaching techniques. To use lecture time in the most efficient way, a lecturer should first instruct students to acquire basic knowledge before coming to class. Various in-class activities then can be used to help students develop higher thinking skills and gain better understanding of the studied material. These in-class activities can take many forms (multiple-choice questions of various complexities, compare-and-contrast tasks, quantitative and problem-solving tasks, questions dealing with interpretations of tables, graphs, and charts, etc.) and should be designed to help student integrate their knowledge, to facilitate communication among students, and at the same time to allow the lecturer to closely monitor the learning process as it happens in the classroom.

AB Students measure out their lives, not with coffee spoons, but with grades on examinations. But what exams mean and whether or not they are a bane or a boon is moot. Senior undergraduates (A. Perrella, J. Koenig, and H. Kwon) designed and administered a 15-item survey that explored the contrasting perceptions of both students (n = 526) and faculty members (n = 33) in a 4-yr undergraduate health sciences program. A series of statements gauged the level of agreement on a 10-point scale. Students and faculty members agreed on the value of assessing student learning with a variety of methods, finding new information to solve problems, assessing conceptual understanding and logical reasoning, having assessments with no single correct answer, and having comments on exams. Clear differences emerged between students and faculty members on specific matters: rubrics, student choice of exam format, assessing creativity, and transfer of learning to novel situations. A followup questionnaire allowed participants to clarify their interpretation of select statements, with responses from 71 students and 17 faculty members. All parties strongly agreed that exams should provide a good learning experience that would help them prepare for the future (students: 8.64 +/- 1.71 and faculty members: 8.03 +/- 2.34).

AB A previously published classroom teaching method for helping students visualize and understand Michaelis-Menten kinetics (19) was used as an anticipatory set with high school and middle school science teachers in an Illinois Math and Science Partnership Program. As part of the activity, the teachers were asked to collect data by replicating the method and to analyze and report the data. All concluded that the rate data they had collected were hyperbolic. As part of a guided inquiry plan, teachers were then prompted to reexamine the method and evaluate its efficacy as a teaching strategy for developing specific kinetic concepts. After further data collection and analysis, the teachers discovered that their data trends were not, in fact, hyperbolic, which led to several teacher-developed revisions aimed at obtaining a true hyperbolic outcome. This article outlines the inquiry process that led to these revisions and illustrates their alignment with several key concepts, such as rapid equilibrium kinetics. Instructional decisions were necessary at several key points, and these are discussed.

AB Carroll RG, Frank M, Ra'anan A, Matyas ML. APS: 125 years of progress of physiology as a scientific discipline and a profession. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 1-9, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00146.2012.-The Experimental Biology 2012 meeting in San Diego, CA, included events to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the founding of the American Physiological Society (APS) and reflect on the recent accomplishments of the society. Most of the APS activities in the past quarter century were guided by a series of strategic plans. Membership in the APS increased by 76% since 1987, and there are now 8,342 regular members of the society, including an expansion of international members to 26% of APS's membership. The numbers of elected officers and committee members have expanded to accommodate this larger membership. APS Publications changed dramatically during this time, having adopted online submission and review of manuscripts as well as a streamlined review and publications process that have significantly shortened the period from submission to acceptance to publication. Compared with 1987, the number of manuscripts submitted has increased by 80% and the number of printed pages increased by 52%. In addition to the refinement of the Experimental Biology meeting (Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology meeting before 1993) format, APS launched a specialty conference program in the 1990s. The educational offerings of APS also dramatically expanded in the past 25 yr, often supported by external grants and contracts. APS education programs now support physiology education and science awareness at K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels as well as continuing education of its members. The founding of APS was tied to the need for effective advocacy, and APS continues to meet those goals through its Science Policy Committee and Animal Care and Experimentation Committees. At its 125th birthday, APS continues to serve the discipline and the needs of its membership.

AB Barfield JP, Cobler DC, Lam ET, Zhang J, Chitiyo G. Differences between African-American and Caucasian students on enrollment influences and barriers in kinesiology-based allied health education programs. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 164-169, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00129.2011.-Kinesiology departments have recently started to offer allied health education programs to attract additional students to teacher education units (9). Although allied health professions offer increased work opportunities, insufficient enrollment and training of minority students in these academic fields contribute to underrepresentation in the workforce (3). To improve workforce diversity, kinesiology departments must understand how enrollment influences and barriers differ by race among prospective students. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify differences in allied health education enrollment influences and enrollment barriers between minority and Caucasian students. Participants (n = 601) consisted of students enrolled in kinesiology-based allied health education programs. Multivariate ANOVA was used to compare group differences in enrollment decision making. "Personal influence," "career opportunity," and "physical self-efficacy" were all significantly stronger enrollment influences among African-American students than among Caucasian students, and "social influence," "experiential opportunity," "academic preparation," and "physical self-efficacy" were all perceived as significantly greater barriers compared with Caucasian students. Findings support the need to recruit African-American students through sport and physical education settings and to market program-based experiential opportunities.

AB Kommalage M. Analytical essay writing: a new activity introduced to a traditional curriculum. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 54-57, 2012; doi: 10.1152/advan.00050.2011.-Medical students following a traditional curriculum get few opportunities to engage in activities such as a literature search, scientific writing, and active and collaborative learning. An analytical essay writing activity (AEWA) in physiology was introduced to first-year students. Each student prepared an essay incorporating new research findings with existing knowledge on a medical topic. Students were expected to study on the topic in detail from textbooks as well as from research publications and write a descriptive and critical analysis. This activity would help them to be aware of new developments in the field and understand the complexity and rapidity of changes in the subject. The aim of this study was to learn how students used the AEWA as a learning process. For this purpose, student perceptions were assessed quantitatively and those of the faculty staff were assessed qualitatively. The data from the students showed considerable achievements in the medical database search, scientific writing, group work, and search for new scientific knowledge. The activity was influenced by prior capabilities in computer use, English language knowledge, and writing ability. Resources available at the medical school had a greater influence on the activity. Faculty staff appreciated the quality of the essay while highlighting areas of improvement. The students seemed to be satisfied with the supervisory role of the faculty staff, whereas the staff felt that the students used the supervisors less than expected. The AEWA was a successful activity promoting many aspects of active and collaborative learning. The low availability of books and information and communications technology (ICT) resources, poor internet connection, and insufficient English language skills were probably responsible for the negative feedback on this activity in this resource-deprived environment.

AB West JB. A Web-based course of lectures in respiratory physiology. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 249-251, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00042.2011.-A complete course of respiratory physiology suitable for first-year medical and graduate students has been placed on the Web for our own students and for other educational institutions. There are several reasons for doing this. The first is that the modern-day student uses a variety of options for acquiring knowledge. These include attending lectures, reading texts, iPod downloads, and surfing the internet. This Web-based course is another option that may be preferable for some students. A second reason is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for some medical schools to find faculty members who are willing and able to teach the principles of respiratory physiology. This is a potentially serious problem because a sound knowledge of respiratory physiology will always be necessary for the intelligent practice of medicine. Schools with limited faculty may find it useful to use these Web-based lectures followed by a discussion session with students. Another reason is that some schools have moved away from systematic lectures to case-based discussions, with the possibility that students will not be exposed to some of the principles of respiratory physiology. The hope is that this comprehensive course of lectures will help students to assimilate this important material as the medical school curriculum continues to expand at a rapid rate.

AB Waters JR, Van Meter P, Perrotti W, Drogo S, Cyr RJ. Human clay models versus cat dissection: how the similarity between the classroom and the exam affects student performance. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 227-236, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00030.2009.-This study examined the effect of different anatomic representations on student learning in a human anatomy class studying the muscular system. Specifically, we examined the efficacy of using dissected cats (with and without handouts) compared with clay sculpting of human structures. Ten undergraduate laboratory sections were assigned to three treatment groups: cat dissection only, cat dissection with handouts, and human clay sculpting with handouts. Exams included higher-order questions that presented novel anatomic images and scenarios that the students did not practice in class. The higher-order anatomy exam questions varied the degree to which students in the different treatments had to transform the anatomic representation studied during laboratory activities to match the representation used in the exam questions. In this respect, exam questions manipulated the similarity between the surface features of the anatomic representations used in the classroom versus the exam. When identifying anatomic structures presented in a photograph or diagram, student performance improved significantly when transformation demands decreased, i.e., students in the human clay sculpting treatment group performed best on human anatomy questions and students in the cat dissection treatment group performed better on cat anatomy questions (independent of the use of handouts). There were similar, but nonsignificant, trends when students were asked functional anatomy questions presented in human and cat contexts. On survey questions designed to measure student attitudes about dissection versus nonanimal alternatives, students typically preferred the method used in their treatment group, suggesting that student preference is too fluid to factor into curricular decisions. When designing curricula, instructors must choose anatomic representations that support their course goals. Human representations are most effective when teaching the human muscular system.

Adv Physiol Educ 34: 41-43, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00001.2010.-Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This fifth installment of Explorations in Statistics revisits power, a concept fundamental to the test of a null hypothesis. Power is the probability that we reject the null hypothesis when it is false. Four things affect power: the probability with which we are willing to reject-by mistake-a true null hypothesis, the magnitude of the difference we want to be able to detect, the variability of the underlying population, and the number of observations in our sample. In an application to an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or to the National Institutes of Health, we define power to justify the sample size we propose.

DE assessment; communication skills; medical students; structured checklist
AB Communication skills are fundamental in healthcare, but assessing them among medical students presents challenges. In the Indian context, the lack of a specific assessment tool further compounds the issue. Thus this study aimed to develop and validate an observation-based communication skills checklist tailored to Phase I Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students. The checklist was developed using both inductive and deductive approaches and underwent rigorous testing to ensure its reliability and validity. After piloting, the finalized version was administered to 84 Phase I MBBS students. Results indicated a critical content validity ratio of 0.78, face validity of 0.80, and an impressive Cronbach's alpha of 0.91, indicating good internal consistency and reliability of the checklist. The students scored over 80% in all checklist domains, except for empathy (73%) and support (74%), highlighting areas for potential improvement. Nonetheless, about 75% of students expressed satisfaction with the checklist's communication skills assessment. The feedback from faculty members was positive, as they found the checklist was easy to use, quick, and effective for evaluating communication skills. Consequently, the checklist's introduction has been well received by both students and faculty. In conclusion, the developed checklist proves to be an effective and valid instrument for assessing communication skills in Phase I MBBS students. By integrating this tool into observed station clinical examinations, medical educators can comprehensively evaluate students' communication behaviors. Moreover, the checklist serves as a valuable resource for bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling future physicians to excel in doctor-patient interactions, a crucial aspect of patient-centered care.

AB In large physiology classes, there is a demand for low-effort, or "light touch," strategies that faculty can use to connect with students and promote increased academic performance and student engagement. The purpose of this study was to compare personalized versus standardized emails following unit quizzes on student perceptions of faculty engagement, participation in academic resources, and academic performance in a junior-level, online physiology course. Students completed the online unit quiz and received a subsequent feedback email from the course director. Students were randomized into the Control (n = 101) or the Experimental (n = 104) group for general or personalized performance feedback emails, respectively. Students completed start and end of semester surveys capturing demographics, course expectations, self-reported use of resources, and impressions of the faculty. Final exam and course grades were collected. Perceptions of faculty were similar between groups, and receiving professor feedback after quizzes did not make the Experimental group more likely to use any of the available academic support services. There was no difference in final exam grades (Control: 73.9 +/- 14.1%; Experimental: 73.4 +/- 15.3%) or final course grades between groups (Control: 79.2 +/- 13.1%; Experimental: 78.7 +/- 13.3; P > 0.05). Personalized performance feedback from light-touch emails did not improve student perceptions of faculty engagement, self-reported participation in academic resources, or academic performance compared with a standardized email in a junior-level, online physiology course. Overall, this study does not support the use of personalized emails regarding quiz performance in an online physiology course.

AB Countercurrent multiplication is widely accepted as the mechanism for the generation of the corticopapillary osmotic gradient in the outer medulla of mammalian kidneys, but the current explanations of it in textbooks and the literature are inefficient and incomplete, leading to confusion for students. This article shares a modified version of countercurrent multiplication with more understandable explanation as a way of motivating peer discussion, further improvement, and future research.
   Countercurrent multiplication (CCM) is widely accepted as the mechanism for the generation of the corticopapillary osmotic gradient in the outer medulla of mammalian kidneys. However, several issues in the literature cause the current explanations of CCM to be inefficient and incomplete. As a result, it is challenging to clearly explain CCM in physiology education. The goal of this article is to share a modified version of CCM with more understandable explanation in the hopes of motivating peer discussion, further improvement, and future research. To reach this goal, the logical processes leading to CCM are first analyzed, which results in a set of formulas that serve as the principles governing CCM. Next, the cessation of CCM is addressed to provide a complete picture of the modified version of CCM. Throughout these two steps, the issues mentioned above are identified and addressed so that how the modified version of CCM eliminates these issues becomes clear. The formulas mentioned above are provided in the Tables S1, S2, and S3 (all Supplemental material is available in the Supplemental Excel File at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23515614) to explain how the interstitial and intrathick ascending limb osmotic concentration (OC) values used in the figures in this article are simulated and how alternative OC values can be generated from Tables S1 and S2 to illustrate CCM.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Countercurrent multiplication is widely accepted as the mechanism for the generation of the corticopapillary osmotic gradient in the outer medulla of mammalian kidneys, but the current explanations of it in textbooks and the literature are inefficient and incomplete, leading to confusion for students.

AB The usefulness of virtual reality (VR) technology in physiology education is largely unexplored. Although VR has the potential to enrich learning experience by enhancing the spatial awareness of students, it is unclear whether VR contributes to active learning of physiology. In the present study, we used a mixed-method research approach to investigate students' perceptions of physiology learning based on VR simulations. Quantitative and qualitative data indicate that the implementation of VR learning environments improves the quality of physiology education by promoting active learning in terms of interactive engagement, interest, problem-solving skills, and feedback. In the Technology-Enabled Active Learning Inventory, which consisted of 20 questions to which students responded along a 7-point Likert scale, the majority of students agreed that VR learning of physiology not only stimulated their curiosity (77%; P < 0.001) but also allowed them to obtain knowledge through diverse formats (76%; P < 0.001), participate in thought-provoking dialogue (72%; P < 0.001), and interact better with peers (72%; P < 0.001). Positive responses in the social, cognitive, behavioral, and evaluative domains of active learning were received from students across different disciplines, including medicine, Chinese medicine, biomedical sciences, and biomedical engineering. Their written feedback showed that VR enhanced their interest in physiology and facilitated the visualization of physiological processes to improve their learning. Overall, this study supports that the integration of VR technology into physiology courses can be an effective teaching strategy.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Virtual reality (VR) improves physiology education by promoting active learning in terms of interactive engagement, interest, problem-solving skills, and feedback.

AB The purpose of this study was to 1) help novice students scaffold problem-solving and engage safely in the deliberate practice of diagnostic reasoning and medical decision-making in real time; 2) assess how accurately students gather and apply data in medical reasoning and treatment during high-fidelity patient simulations (HFPSs); 3) identify students' scientific misconceptions related to the case; 4) promote student metacognitive processing, self-assessment, and self-efficacy; and 5) facilitate the explicit calibration of student confidence in deliberate reasoning with patient outcomes. In a mixed-method design, a metacognitive calibration self -assessing (MCC) survey tool was applied to HFPS (n = 80, 20 teams of 6 medical students) and semistructured interviews were conducted with faculty (n = 5). When scored by faculty with a rubric, the mean student accuracy ranged from 23% to 74%, whereas their self-assessment of confidence ranged from 71% to 86%. This result revealed overconfidence bias in novice students regarding the correctness of their wrong responses. The most common misconception identified was inverting cause and effect: metabolic acidosis was pointed to as the cause of the patient's problems rather than a consequence of untreated diabetes mellitus. The most common treatment error was overtreatment, with unnecessary added medication. Interviews with faculty suggested that the MCC tool improved the team process by slowing students down, requiring them to think through their answers, and that overall the tool improved their critical thinking. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a metacognitive confidence calibration tool to assist novice students in learning safely to make deliberate diagnostic reasoning and decisions on patient care in real time dur-ing complex simulations while observing objectively their levels of psychological confidence against patient outcomes.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study demonstrates the feasibility of a metacognitive confidence calibration tool (MCC) to assess and promote novices in the learning of diagnostic reasoning and treatment decisions on patient care in real time during high-fi- delity patient simulations while comparing confidence and accuracy data and identifying students' scientific misconceptions. Results revealed the presence of overconfidence bias, overtreatment, and the misconception of metabolic acidosis as the cause of the patient's problems rather than a consequence of untreated diabetes mellitus.

AB Misalignments in teaching pedagogies between secondary schools and tertiary institutions have exacerbated educational disparities among students from different backgrounds. Given the variation in students' educational background and competencies, there was a need to develop an Anatomy and Physiology (A&P) Foundational Knowledge Assessment to establish the levels of preparedness of first-year medical students. Previous work that focused on the development of the assessment showed it to be effective in measuring students' foundational knowledge in human anatomy and physiology. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the A&P Foundational Knowledge Assessment in determining students' prior knowledge and predicting academic performance of first-year students in their anatomy and physiology studies. Three hundred seventy first-year students, across two cohort years, 2017 and 2018, completed the A&P Foundational Knowledge Assessment. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and Pearson's correlation. Results show that for both cohorts similar to 30% of students scored <= 55% and were potentially at risk of performing poorly in their anatomy and physiology studies. Pearson's correlation showed a significant relationship between students' performance on the foundational knowledge assessment and their anatomy and physiology assessments. For both cohorts, >10% of students identified by the A&P Foundational Knowledge Assessment were at risk of either failing the course, entering an extended degree program, or being excluded from the program. Results indicate that the assessment is a good predictor for differentiating medical students' performance in first-year anatomy and physiology.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development of a foundational knowledge assessment tool to predict academic performance of medical students in first-year anatomy and physiology.

AB A limited number of studies have explored the impact of blended exercise physiology theory curricula on student learning and experience. This study aimed to investigate the impact of an exercise physiology blended learning theory module on student performance, engagement, and perceptions. The module, which comprised a range of elements (student guide, lecturer-recorded videos, supplementary videos, formative quizzes, workshops, and discussion forum), was implemented in a third-year subject taken by students in nonspecialist undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees. Students chose which elements to engage with to support their learning. Exam performance was assessed by comparing exam marks from fully face-to-face delivery to the blended delivery with an independent t test. Student perceptions were determined via an end-of-module questionnaire comprised of Likert-scale questions and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted on the Likert-scale responses, and qualitative content analysis was conducted on the open-ended responses. Student engagement with online resources was determined through analysis of access statistics from the learning management system. Student exam marks in the blended learning student group were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than in the face-to-face group, even though the questions were of a higher Bloom's level in the blended learning group. Students preferred blended delivery over fully face-to-face delivery. Most students accessed the student guide, lecturer-recorded videos, and quizzes, with supplementary videos, workshops, and discussion forums accessed by fewer students. In conclusion, a blended exercise physiology theory module improved student exam performance and was positively perceived by students, and engagement with the elements of the module was varied.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Few studies have explored the impact of blended delivery of exercise physiology theory curricula on student learning and experience. This study investigated the impact of a novel blended model on student learning and experience. The module comprised a range of elements (student guide, lecturer-recorded videos, supplementary videos, formative quizzes, workshops, and discussion forum), where students were able to choose which elements to engage with to support their learning.

AB Although there is increased uptake of active learning approaches in especially developed countries, this is still lagging within the African context. The current study therefore focused on the implementation of group learning at Stellenbosch University, with several modifications versus our earlier, pilot study. Students freely formed small groups at the start of a 5-wk cardiovascular physiology lecture series and were apportioned three separate assignments to complete over this period. This included three in-class group-learning sessions, while students also completed group work outside class times. The active learning element was embedded within a constructive alignment framework. Our data revealed that 75% of the students felt that the in-class sessions was a good use of their time and that they progressively improved their assignment scores, i.e., 67.5 9.3%, 72.4 +/- 9.8%, and 76.1 +/- 9.5% for the first, second, and final ones, respectively (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the average class score for their final test (68 +/- 15.1%) was higher when compared with the average class score (57.5 +/- 19.4%) calculated for the previous 3 yr (P < 0.0001). This study revealed two major findings: i.e., 1) students displayed a strong positive response regarding the adoption of in-class collaborative group work, and 2) the introduction of such active learning elements correlated with improved student assignment and test scores. Based on these findings, we propose additional modifications (including a shift to more formative assessments) to ensure even greater success with the roll-out of such active learning elements within the African context.

ID EARLY CLINICAL-EXPOSURE; STUDENTS
AB Preclinical task-based learning (TskBL) is a simulated learning approach in which the focus for students is a real task done by a medical professional. TskBL includes standardized patient encounters and is helpful to provide early clinical exposure. Our study aimed at planning, implementing, and assessing TskBL among first-year medical students and comparing it to the conventional method of tutorials in the physiology MBBS curriculum. This is a nonequivalent group quasi-experimental study approved by the institutional ethics committee. TskBL was conducted for seven topics among first-year medical students of Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore for three academic years. Participants were divided into a TskBL group and a control group. Both groups attended the theory classes in physiology, practical sessions, and clinical examinations concerning the tasks. After this, the TskBL group underwent TskBL, and the control group underwent tutorials. Pretest and posttest assessments were conducted by using a multiple choice question (MCQ) test and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs).The mean TskBL scores for MCQ (exception: hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and OSCE (exception: anemia and hypertension) were significantly higher than the tutorial group. Pretest and posttest scores revealed significantly higher MCQ and OSCE scores for TskBL (exception: MCQ score for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The tutorial group did not show a significant improvement in test scores for all the tasks. The TskBL strategy could be used for topics that are likely to be encountered by the students during clinical attachments. Small group teaching can include TskBL in preference to tutorials to provide early clinical exposure in medical schools.

AB In problem-based learning (PBL), the steps and processes present in the PBL tutorial cycle are essential for constructive, selfdirected, collaborative, and contextual student learning. This article presents a procedural study of a PBL tutorial cycle with high school students new to the method regarding human respiration and circulation physiology. We observed group dynamics and the learning process that occurred throughout the PBL tutorial cycle. The results indicate that conceptual changes were close to the planned learning objectives and that students enjoyed studying applying PBL. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between group dynamics, self-directed learning and learning outcomes. Our results provide grounds for restructuring the tutorial cycle, especially important for novice PBL students, such as problem reformulation and the development and diversification of applied learning scaffolds. We conclude that the qualitative analysis performed herein can yield a deeper understanding of the PBL tutorial cycle and may be used to foster PBL implementation in institutions with little experience with the method and monitor its outcomes in organizations with mature PBL use.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Active learning activities offer opportunities for medical students to facilitate the retention of knowledge and develop soft skills. We aimed to create a guide for an interdisciplinary mock trial learning activity within the medical curriculum of the College of Medicine, Anhembi Morumbi University-Laureate International Universities, Sao Paulo, Brazil. We designed an "Animal Experimentation Mock Trial" in which students are coached to search for scientific, legal, and ethical arguments pro and contra animal experimentation in medical research. The mock trial is prepared and staged with student teams to play the 1) presiding judge, 2) the plaintiffs attorney and expert witnesses contra animal research, 3) the defense attorney and expert witnesses pro animal research, and 4) the jury. The plaintiff and defense teams made presentations, and between each presentation the jury put questions to presenters (cross-examination). The jury team gave two evaluation scores after the plaintiff's presentation and then after the defense presentation. The formal feedback for this active learning activity indicated that students expressed satisfaction with the teaching strategies employed in the course. The mock trial with the lesson plan provides a learning mean to exemplify the complex relationship between animal experimentation, medical evidence, ethics, and law/regulations. This mock trial helps medical students to develop their soft skills, such as the ability to collaborate and also to recognize the limits of their own knowledge, important for professional development. The importance of interdisciplinary discussions is demonstrated by increasing the awareness of the multidisciplinary aspect of animal research.

ID FRAMEWORK; STUDENTS; PRINCIPLES
AB It is increasingly difficult for faculty to cover all of the content in a physiology course. Given this constraint, recent efforts in the physiology teaching community, and in particular the Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG), have promoted using core concepts to help students master key physiological principles. This report summarizes the experiences of four faculty members who teach physiology using the core concepts in various educational environments and identifies several common strengths and challenges they have encountered thus far. Strengths of using the core concepts include the transfer of knowledge to solve unknown problems and providing a framework to build a course. Challenges include applying them in a teach-taught course and balancing time spent on content and the core concepts. This is the first report to document the use of the physiology core concepts in a course, and the authors encourage additional faculty to not only adopt the core concepts for their own use, but share their approaches and experiences with the entire teaching community.

AB Online and distance education may be dismissed by educators who argue that these methods are not equivalent to traditional face-to-face education due to the lack of laboratory classes. However, smartphone-assisted experimentation is an innovative and powerful didactic tool that helps educators in the teaching process of physiology, particularly in situations with a lack of financial support for purchasing laboratory equipment, or lack of support for homework and assignments, distance learning courses, and emergency remote education, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we present the concept of the mobile learning laboratory (MobLeLab), which is a collection of smartphone applications that allow scientific data collection, such as physiological variables, for educational purposes. The three types of MobLeLabs (simulators, built-in, and plug-in) are presented, as well as ideas on how to use smartphone sensors to collect physiological data. Additionally, we elaborate on the principles of the protocols for physiology education with MobLeLabs and discuss their importance to fostering scientific method reasoning by students.

AB Vertical integration is believed to increase motivation by providing context for the learning. In this quasi-experimental study, cohort I took two horizontally integrated modules: structure and function of head, neck, and special senses in the second year, and pathophysiology and clinical sciences in the third year. Cohort II took a combined, vertically integrated module in the second year. Data from the questionnaire and examination scores were compared. Response rate was 80.1% (125/156) for cohort I and 57.6% (98/170) for cohort II. Response to the statement that vertical integration provides context to basic sciences was mixed with a higher agreement in cohort II (51.5 vs. 37.2%; P = 0.04). Cohort II was least satisfied with the appropriateness of self-study time (52.0 vs. 34.7%; P = 0.01). However, cohort II felt that the basic sciences lectures (90.8 vs. 69.4%; P < 0.01) and the clinical skills sessions (85.7 vs. 62.1%; P < 0.01) were more effective. Cohort II was less satisfied with clinical lectures (80.6 vs. 56.1%; P < 0.01) and was less confident in achieving clinical learning objectives (72.8 vs. 40.8%; P < 0.01). Mean multiple-choice questions and problem-based learning scores were similar. However, the short-answer question score was higher for cohort I [82.48 (SD 14.9) vs. 70.74 (SD 17.9); P < 0.01]. Overall, the idea of early vertical integration had a mixed response. It improved the effectiveness of basic sciences lectures and clinical skills sessions. Achievement of clinical learning outcomes was compromised. A disparity in the module's duration and curricular content, and students' ability to grasp clinical concepts and faculty's expectations are the possible reasons. Increased duration and better communication with clinical faculty may improve early introduction of vertical integration.

AB The aims of this study are to 1) design feasible active collaborative educational approaches to teach and assess three of the newly described lifestyle medicine (LM) competencies to students at multiple locations; and 2) determine whether a mixed, flexible instructional delivery approach impacts students' learning and perception of confidence in LM. The educational interventions were part of the undergraduate clinical medical education curriculum and have two parts: 1) an asynchronous session [online self-learning module (SLM)], and 2) a synchronous session using case-based collaborative learning delivered either mostly face to face, as determined by the instructor (approach A) or mostly virtual, as determined by the student (approach B). Both approaches were delivered in the curriculum as planned to 27 students in approach A (26% attending virtually) and 31 students in approach B (90% attending virtually). Approach B required more planning time. Approach A students (26 of 27) agreed that the SLM was valuable as an educational tool. The performance in the summative assessment was similar (P = 0.49) in both approaches [means (SD): 33.2 points (SD 10.6) approach A vs. 33.2 points (SD 10.1) approach B]. Students reported a similar increase in confidence (P = 0.33) with setting lifestyle change goals. The two educational approaches presented here address three of the new LM competencies using active collaborative learning. Both approaches are feasible for synchronous delivery to students located at local and distant sites, either face to face or virtual. The increase in the proportion of students attending virtually did not decrease the measured outcomes of learning and perceptions of confidence.

AB Physiology is a key element of "bioscience" education within pre-registration nursing programs, but there is a lack of clarity on what is included. Physiology and bioscience content and delivery are highly varied across both higher education institutions and the related programs in the United Kingdom (UK). Despite evidence highlighting concerns over nurses' lack of bioscience knowledge and unsafe practice, there is no universally agreed on curriculum with detailed outcomes of minimum levels of knowledge to support nurses in practice and patient care. This study aimed to inform the construction of discipline-specific physiology learning outcomes to clarify relevant physiological topics required in pre-registration nursing. Initially, 360 learning outcomes were identified from various sources. Using a modified Delphi approach, an expert panel from the Bioscience in Nurse Education group reviewed and modified the list to 195 proposed outcomes. These were circulated to universities in the UK who teach nursing (n = 65). Outcomes that had 80% consensus were automatically included in the next round, with others recommended with modification (response rate 22%). The panel reviewed the modifications, and 182 outcomes were circulated in the second questionnaire (response rate 23%), and further panel review resulting in 177 outcomes agreed. These learning outcomes do not suggest how they should be delivered, but gives the basic level required for qualification as a nurse commensurate with the Nursing and Midwifery Council new standards for the "future nurse."

AB Many medical schools offer pre-professional programs to undergraduate students. The main purpose of the university pre-professional program (UPPP) is to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills required to successfully cope with the academic demands of further education provided by professional colleges. The aim of this commentary article is to describe the role of UPPP at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in preparing students to continue studies at the College of Medicine (COM) and other health-related colleges. The anatomy and physiology course is presented as a representative model. An outline of the UPPP in the context of the curriculum, teaching strategies, learning facilities, and assessment is presented. The pre-professional program at KSAU-HS prepares school graduates to become self-learners and enable them to learn effectively in the clinical context in a problem-based learning curriculum at COM.

AB Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method that offers students the opportunity to develop self-regulatory strategies as an explicit learning outcome. As a multifaceted PBL environment, the guidance of tutors is important to students as they develop selfregulatory learning (SRI-) skills and self-efficacy, the most focused motivational element in SRL. The present study examines the relationship between academic achievement and PBL self-efficacy levels, as well as the role played by tutors. A cross-sectional study was conducted with third- year medical students (n = 257; 75%). The SRL perception (SRLP) scale, the self-efficacy for PHI, scale (SPBL), tutor evaluation scale (TES), and an achievement test were used to gather data in this study. In every scale, participant scores were higher than the midpoint, which is 3. There were positive correlations between SRL, self-efficacy, and the tutoring scores of tutors. As the correlation between SRLP and achievement was not significant, achievement was removed from the regression equation, and only SPBL and TES results were used. The results of the regression analysis indicated that SPBL and TES explained 36% of the variance. The level of self-efficacy in PBL predicted the students' SRL abilities, as did tutor evaluations. The findings show that students used their SRL skills and had beliefs about their ability to learn effectively in the PBL context. Both the tutors' tutoring skills and the students' self-efficacy made important contributions to improving the students' self-regulated learning skills.

AB We describe the development of a new, freely available, online, programmatic-level assessment tool, Measuring Achievement and Progress in Science in Physiology, or Phys-MAPS (http://cperl.lassp.cornell.edu/bio-maps). Aligned with the conceptual frameworks of Core Principles of Physiology, and Vision and Change Core Concepts, Phys-MAPS can be used to evaluate student learning of core physiology concepts at multiple time points in an undergraduate physiology program, providing a valuable longitudinal tool to gain insight into student thinking and aid in the data-driven reform of physiology curricula. Phys-MAPS questions have a modified multiple true/false design and were developed using an iterative process, including student interviews and physiology expert review to verify scientific accuracy. appropriateness for physiology majors, and clarity. The final version of Phys-MAPS was tested with 2,600 students across 13 universities, has evidence of reliability, and has no significant statement biases. Over 90% of the physiology experts surveyed agreed that each Phys-MAPS statement was scientifically accurate and relevant to a physiology major. When testing each statement for bias, differential item functioning analysis demonstrated only a small effect size (<0.008) of any tested demographic variable. Regarding student performance, Phys-MAPS can also distinguish between lower and upper division students, both across different institutions (average overall scores increase with each level of class standing; two-way ANOVA. P < 0.001) and within each of three sample institutions (each ANOVA, P <= 0.001). Furthermore, at the level of individual concepts, only evolution and homeostasis do not demonstrate the typical increase across class standing. suggesting these concepts likely present consistent conceptual challenges for physiology students.

AB This workshop was held at the Teaching Satellite Meeting of the International Union of Physiological Sciences (RJPS). August 5-8. 2017, in Buzios, Rio de Janiero. Brazil. The satellite meeting was attended by physiology educators from across the globe, of whom 34 attended this workshop. The aim of the workshop was to explore how experimental design is taught to students of physiology in different institutions, to consider the aspects that students find challenging, to share good practice, and to think about how experimental design teaching could be improved. Through small-group discussions that were then shared with the whole group. participants were challenged to develop the outline of a research project to investigate a broad topic and then to identify the challenges that students might face if they were given that task. Finally, the group thought about what, in practical terms, could be done to help develop experimental design skills in undergraduates. The outcomes of the discussions are summarized in this report.

TI An alternative introduction to reading and evaluating the primary
   literature for beginning graduate students
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE alternative education process; primary literature
AB Students are challenged in transitioning from acquiring knowledge and understanding through reading textbooks to their learning to select, read, evaluate, and synthesize the primary literature. A customary approach to teaching this transition to beginning graduate students is for a faculty member to assign "readings" from the recent literature that promise to become key publications; such assignments generally underscore recent, novel scientific content. We advocate here an alternative approach for coaching students very early in their training: first, to read, analyze, and discuss a paper that highlights critically important features of effective and valid experimental design; and, second, to study a paper that can be shown historically to have fundamentally changed the way in which physiological function is understood. We consider as an example of the first goal a study that purports to demonstrate a principle of thermoregulation, but that interaction between students and instructor reveals the study's lack of an essential control. The second goal requires sufficient time for the publication to concretely validate its contribution(s). The purpose is to identify those essential properties of the selected paper that contributed to its having become a truly exemplary study. We present a 1957 paper by Dr. A. C. Burton (Am Heart J 54: 801-810, 1957) as an illustration and analyze the study with respect to those attributes that contributed to its lasting importance. These alternative approaches to introduce inexperienced students to the original literature can produce critical insight into the process and can help students inculcate essential practices, guiding them to more productive careers.

ID HEART; PRESSURE; BEAT
AB The heart is often regarded as a compression pump. Therefore, determination of pressure and volume is essential for cardiac function analysis. Traditionally, ventricular performance was described in terms of the Starling curve, i.e., output related to input. This view is based on two variables (namely, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume), often studied in the isolated (i.e., denervated) heart, and has dominated the interpretation of cardiac mechanics over the last century. The ratio of the prevailing coordinates within that paradigm is termed ejection fraction (EF), which is the popular metric routinely used in the clinic. Here we present an insightful alternative approach while describing volume regulation by relating end-systolic volume (ESV) to end-diastolic volume. This route obviates the undesired use of metrics derived from differences or ratios, as employed in previous models. We illustrate basic principles concerning ventricular volume regulation by data obtained from intact animal experiments and collected in healthy humans. Special attention is given to sex-specific differences. The method can be applied to the dynamics of a single heart and to an ensemble of individuals. Group analysis allows for stratification regarding sex, age, medication, and additional clinically relevant covariates. A straightforward procedure derives the relationship between EF and ESV and describes myocardial oxygen consumption in terms of ESV. This representation enhances insight and reduces the impact of the metric EF, in favor of the end-systolic elastance concept advanced 4 decades ago.

AB The chest X-ray is the most commonly performed medical imaging study; however, the lateral chest film intimidates many physicians and medical students. The lateral view is more difficult to interpret than the frontal view but provides important information that is either not visible or not as evident on frontal view, and inability to read it may lead to missed diagnoses and more expensive imaging. The objective of this study was to assess a novel mnemonic-based approach to teaching medical students to proficiently read a lateral film using a prospective pilot study. A clinical faculty radiologist taught two groups of second-year medical students to read a lateral chest X-ray. One group learned a novel mnemonic-based method (MUM), and the other cohort performed directed web-based self-study (STMM). Each cohort was given a pre- and postassessment, and their performance was analyzed. A total of n = 29 students participated with n = 14 being taught the mnemonic method. The MUM group significantly (P = 0.001) improved their score vs. the STMM group This study demonstrates students can quickly and effectively learn to read a lateral chest film using this novel mnemonic.

TI Designing and implementing a physiology course for a new doctoral

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE active learning; team-based learning; assessment
AB Recently, the Occupational Therapy Department requested a custom-designed medical physiology course for the students in the new occupational therapy doctoral program. The first author, a physiologist with extensive experience in teaching both undergraduate preprofessional and medical students in human physiology, was recruited to design and implement the course. The course was designed to be consistent with the constructivist philosophy that guides the occupational therapy curriculum. The course was offered for the first time during fall/spring 2015/2016 and included both firstand second-year occupational therapy doctoral students. A number of anonymous assessment tools were used to evaluate students' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of various pedagogies used in the course in enhancing their learning. A summative course assessment survey with comments was used at the end of the course. This paper describes the model of course design and the student feedback, which generated some suggestions for improvement of the course. This approach in designing a new course for a new disciplinary group of students should be helpful to other faculty involved in developing courses for health career programs populated by students with variable physiology backgrounds and different educational needs. The final relevant feedback from the course would be to have the students evaluate the usefulness of the course to their future careers immediately following their certification examinations in a year or two and during their subsequent clinical experiences; however, that information will likely be more difficult to obtain.

AB This study documents the efforts of the North Dakota (ND) IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) program to assist in the development of undergraduate research programs at four state-supported primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) in ND. The study was initiated in the 2004-2005 academic year and continues to the present. The study shows that gaining initial institutional support for undergraduate research was assisted by providing salary support for faculty involved in undergraduate research. Once research was ongoing, each institution evolved their own unique plan for the use of support from the ND INBRE. Undergraduate student researchers have prepared, presented, and defended their research results on 188 unique posters since initiation of the program, with many posters being presented at more than one meeting. PUI faculty have authored 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts. Evaluation has shown that over 95% of the undergraduate students performing research matriculated with their bachelor's degree. Career choices of 77.2% of these graduates was determined, and 37% pursued a career in the health professions. Of the students not pursuing a post-baccalaureate degree, 81.2% chose careers directly linked to science. The study reinforces the concept that undergraduate research can be performed directly on the PUI campus and be of value in preparing the next generation of health professionals in research, service, and teaching.

A model was developed to assist lecturers, especially those that are new to the profession, to use a blended approach to design meaningful learning interventions for physiology. The aim of the model is to encourage methodical development of learning interventions, while the purpose is to provide conceptual and communication tools that can be used to develop appropriate operational learning interventions. A whole brain approach that encourages challenging the four quadrants is encouraged. The main arguments of the model are to first determine the learning task requirements, as these will inform the design and development of learning interventions to facilitate learning and the assessment thereof. Delivery of the content is based on a blended approach.

AB Different tools have been used to facilitate the teaching and learning process in different areas of knowledge. Practical activities represent a form of teaching in which students not only listen to theoretical concepts but are also able to link theory and practice, and their importance in the biological sciences is notable. Sometimes, however, there is neither the time nor the resources to promote laboratory practices in physiology classes. In this sense, home-based practical activities may be an interesting alternative. Here, different approaches of practical activities were used and students' perceptions of the contributions of home-based practical activities (HBPA) and laboratory-based practical activities (LBPA) for physiology learning were collected. After each approach, the students evaluated the activities through an anonymous questionnaire. A total of 49 students completed the questionnaires, and the results demonstrate that both HBPA and LBPA were considered important contributors to physiology learning but that this contribution was more significant in the case of LBPA (chi(2) = 4.356, P = 0.037).

AB Testing strategies can either have a very positive or negative effect on the learning process. The aim of this study was to examine the degree of consistency in evaluating the practicality and logic of questions from a medical school pathophysiology test, between students and family medicine doctors. The study engaged 77 family medicine doctors and 51 students. Ten questions were taken from cardiac pathophysiology and 10 questions from pulmonary pathophysiology, and each question was assessed on the criteria of practicality and logic. A nonparametric Mann- Whitney test was used to test the difference between evaluators. On the criteria of logic, only four out of 20 items were evaluated differently by students in comparison to doctors, two items each from the fields of cardiology and pulmonology. On the criteria of practicality, for six of the 20 items there were statistically significant differences between the students and doctors, with three items each from cardiology and pulmonology. Based on these indicative results, students should be involved in the qualitative assessment of exam questions, which should be performed regularly under a strictly regulated process.

DE community college; education research; physiology education; medical
   school
AB Community colleges are significant in the landscape of undergraduate STEM (science technology, engineering, and mathematics) education (9), including biology, premedical, and other preprofessional education. Thirty percent of first-year medical school students in 2012 attended a community college. Students attend at different times in high school, their first 2 yr of college, and postbaccalaureate. The community college pathway is particularly important for traditionally underrepresented groups. Premedical students who first attend community college are more likely to practice in underserved communities (2). For many students, community colleges have significant advantages over 4-yr institutions. Pragmatically, they are local, affordable, and flexible, which accommodates students' work and family commitments. Academically, community colleges offer teaching faculty, smaller class sizes, and accessible learning support systems. Community colleges are fertile ground for universities and medical schools to recruit diverse students and support faculty. Community college students and faculty face several challenges (6, 8). There are limited interactions between 2- and 4-yr institutions, and the ease of transfer processes varies. In addition, faculty who study and work to improve the physiology education experience often encounter obstacles. Here, we describe barriers and detail existing resources and opportunities useful in navigating challenges. We invite physiology educators from 2- and 4-yr institutions to engage in sharing resources and facilitating physiology education improvement across institutions. Given the need for STEM majors and health care professionals, 4-yr colleges and universities will continue to benefit from students who take introductory biology, physiology, and anatomy and physiology courses at community colleges.

AB A growing body of evidence demonstrates a critical role for effective, meaningful feedback to enhance student learning. Effective feedback can become part of the learning cycle that is not only a learning opportunity for the student but can also be used to inform the teacher and ongoing curriculum development. Feedback is considered particularly important during the first year of university and can even be viewed as a retention strategy that can help attenuate student performance anxieties and solidify perceptions of academic support. Unfortunately, the provision of individualized, timely feedback can be particularly challenging in first-year courses as they tend to be large and diverse cohort classes that pose challenges of time and logistics. Various forms of generic feedback can provide rapid and cost-effect feedback to large cohorts but may be of limited benefit to students other than signaling weaknesses in knowledge. The present study describes a method that was used to provide formative task-related feedback to a large cohort of first-year physiology and anatomy students. Based on student evaluations presented in this study, this method provided feedback in a manner that engaged students, uncovered underlying misconceptions, facilitated peer discussion, and provided opportunity for new instruction while allowing the lecturer to recognize common gaps in knowledge and inform ongoing curriculum development.

AB Members of the Education Committee of the Brazilian Society of Physiology have developed multiple outreach models to improve the appreciation of science and physiology at the precollege level. The members of this committee act in concert with important Brazilian governmental strategies to promote training of undergraduate students in the teaching environment of secondary and high schools. One of these governmental strategies, the Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Iniciacao a` Docencia, a Brazilian public policy of teaching enhancement implemented by the Coorde-nacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) since 2007, represents a well-articulated public policy that can promote the partnership between University and Schools (7). Furthermore, the Program "Novos Talentos" (New Talents)/CAPES/Ministry of Education is another government initiative to bring together university and high-level technical training with the reality of Brazilian schools. Linked to the New Talents Program, in partnership with the British Council/Newton Fund, CAPES recently promoted the visit of some university professors that coordinate New Talents projects to formal and informal educational science spaces in the United Kingdom (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, BrazilUnited King-dom International Cooperation Program) to qualify the actions developed in this area in Brazil, and one of us had the opportunity to participate with this.

AB Shifts in educational research, in how scholarship in higher education is defined, and in how funding is appropriated suggest that educators within basic science fields can benefit from increased understanding of learning theory and how it applies to classroom practice. This article uses a mock curriculum design scenario as a framework for the introduction of five major learning theories. Foundational constructs and principles from each theory and how they apply to the proposed curriculum designs are described. A summative table that includes basic principles, constructs, and classroom applications as well as the role of the teacher and learner is also provided for each theory.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Editorial Material
AB THE PROCESS OF TEACHING and learning at the undergraduate level is challenged by an increasing amount of content (1). Now it's not enough to convey knowledge; it's also necessary to seek alternative ways to motivate and capture the interest of students both during class and outside of class.
   Currently, social networks are popular among students (5) and are used to establish and maintain contacts (6). Facebook, one of the most popularly accessed social networks, has similar to 500 million registered users (2) and consequently has the potential to become an ally in the teaching and learning process. If properly used, Facebook allows the formation of groups with common interests, enables the exchange of information, and stimulates the search for knowledge. Considering this context in Brazil, where the number of connections grew from 8.8 to 35 million between 2010 and 2011 (3), attracting similar to 1 trillion monthly visits (4), we asked ourselves: why not partner the physiology teaching with the use of Facebook, to try to increase students' interest in physiology, using an interdisciplinary approach? Consequently, we created a group on Facebook, which served as a support tool for teaching physiology at the health area undergraduate courses of the Federal University of Pampa (Unipampa) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

AB When a subject is heated, the stimulation of temperature-sensitive nerve endings in the skin, and the raising of the central body temperature, results in the reflex release of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone in the skin of the extremities, causing a measurable temperature increase at the site of release. In the sympathetic release test, the subject is gently heated by placing the feet and calves in a commercially available foot warming pouch or immersing the feet and calves in warm water and wrapping the subject in blankets. Skin blood flow is estimated from measurements of skin temperature in the fingers. Normally skin temperature of the fingers is 65-75 degrees F in cool conditions (environmental temperature: 59-68 degrees F) and rises to 85-95 degrees F during body heating. Deviations in this pattern may mean that there is abnormal sympathetic vasoconstrictor control of skin blood flow. Abnormal skin blood flow can substantially impair an individual's ability to thermoregulate and has important clinical implications. During whole body heating, the skin temperature from three different skin sites is monitored and oral temperature is monitored as an index of core temperature. Students determine the fingertip temperature at which the reflex release of sympathetic activity occurs and its maximal attainment, which reflects the vasodilating capacity of this cutaneous vascular bed. Students should interpret typical sample data for certain clinical conditions (Raynaud's disease, peripheral vascular disease, and postsympathectomy) and explain why there may be altered skin blood flow in these disorders.

Inexpensive public engagement exercises to explain the value of basic biomedical research on Drosophila melanogaster. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 384-392, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00045.2011.-Invertebrate model organisms are powerful systems for uncovering conserved principles of animal biology. Despite widespread use in scientific communities, invertebrate research is often severely undervalued by laypeople. Here, we present a set of simple, inexpensive public outreach exercises aimed at explaining to the public why basic research on one particular invertebrate, the insect Drosophila melanogaster, is valuable. First, we designed seven teaching modules that highlight cutting-edge research in Drosophila genetics, metabolism, physiology, and behavior. We then implemented these exercises in a public outreach event that included both children and adults. Quantitative evaluation of participant feedback suggests that these exercises 1) teach principles of animal biology, 2) help laypeople better understand why researchers study fruit flies, and 3) are effective over a wide range of age groups. Overall, this work provides a blueprint for how to use Drosophila as a vehicle for increasing public awareness and appreciation of basic research on genetically tractable insects in particular and invertebrates in general.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 146-148, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00106.2010.-The expansion of biomedical knowledge and the pursuit of more meaningful learning have led to world-wide evidence-based innovative changes in medical education and curricula. The recent emphasis on problem-based learning (PBL) and student-centred learning environments are, however, not being implemented in Nigerian medical schools. Traditional didactic lectures thus predominate, and learning is further constrained by funding gaps, poor infrastructure, and increasing class sizes. We reviewed medical students' perceptions of their exposed learning environment to determine preferences, shortcomings, and prescriptions for improvements. The results confirm declining interest in didactic lectures and practical sessions with preferences for peer-tutored discussion classes, which were considered more interactive and interesting. This study recommends more emphasis on student-centered learning with alternatives to passive lecture formats and repetitive cookbook practical sessions. The institutionalization of student feedback processes in Nigerian medical schools is also highly recommended.

AB Johnson CD. A demonstration of sympathetic cotransmission. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 217-221, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00070.2010.-Currently, most undergraduate textbooks that cover the autonomic nervous system retain the concept that autonomic nerves release either acetylcholine or norepinephrine. However, in recent years, a large volume of research has superseded this concept with one in which autonomic nerves normally release at least one cotransmitter along with a dominant transmitter that may or may not be acetylcholine or norepinephrine. Cotransmission involving the simultaneous release of norepinephrine, ATP, and neuropeptide Y can easily be demonstrated in an isometric ring preparation of the rat tail artery, which is described here. The experiment clearly demonstrates the principle of cotransmission but allows more advanced concepts in autonomic cotransmission to be addressed.

Adv Physiol Educ 34: 70-74, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00070.2009.-This study aimed to develop, implement, and assess a distance module in endocrine physiology in TelEduc for undergraduate nursing students from a public university in Brazil, with a sample size of 44 students. Stage 1 consisted of the development of the module, through the process of creating a distance course by means of the Web. Stage 2 was the planning of the module's practical functioning, and stage 3 was the planning of student evaluations. In the experts' assessment, the module complied with pedagogical and technical requirements most of the time. In the practical functioning stage, 10 h were dedicated for on-site activities and 10 h for distance activities. Most students (93.2%) were women between 19 and 23 yr of age (75%). The internet was the most used means to remain updated for 23 students (59.0%), and 30 students (68.2%) accessed it from the teaching institution. A personal computer was used by 23 students (56.1%), and most of them (58.1%) learned to use it alone. Access to a forum was more dispersed (variation coefficient: 86.80%) than access to chat (variation coefficient: 65.14%). Average participation was 30 students in forums and 22 students in the chat. Students' final grades in the module averaged 8.5 (SD: 1.2). TelEduc was shown to be efficient in supporting the teaching- learning process of endocrine physiology.

ID FEEDBACK; STUDENTS; PERCEPTION; LITERACY
AB The development of science writing and presentation skills is necessary for a successful science career. Too often these skills are not included in pre- or postsecondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, leading to a disconnect between high schoolers' expectations for college preparedness and the skills needed to succeed in college. The Young Scientist Program Summer Focus recruits high school students from historically marginalized backgrounds to participate in 8-week summer internships at Washington University in St. Louis. Students conduct hands-on biomedical research projects under the mentorship of Washington University scientists (graduate students, postdoctorates, lab staff). Here, we present the curriculum for a science communication course that accompanies this early research experience. The course is designed to strengthen students' communication skills (critical reading, writing, presenting, and peer review) through a combination of weekly lectures and active learning methods. It prepares students for the capstone of their summer internship: writing a scientific paper and presenting their results at a closing symposium. We administered pre- and postprogram surveys to four Summer Focus cohorts to determine whether the course met its learning objectives. We found significant improvements in students' self-confidence in reading, interpreting, and communicating scientific data. Thus, this course provides a successful model for introducing science literacy and communication skills that are necessary for any career in STEM. We provide a detailed outline of the course structure and content so that this training can be incorporated into any undergraduate and graduate research programs.

AB A task force of physiology educators from 25 Australian universities generated an Australia-wide consensus on seven core concepts for physiology curricula. One adopted core concept was "cell membrane," defined as "Cell membranes determine what substances enter or leave the cell and its organelles. They are essential for cell signaling, transport, and other cellular functions." This concept was unpacked by a team of 3 Australian physiology educators into 4 themes and 33 subthemes arranged in a hierarchical structure up to 5 levels deep. The four themes related to defining the cell membrane, cell membrane structure, transport across cell membranes, and cell membrane potentials. Subsequently, 22 physiology educators with a broad range of teaching experience reviewed and assessed the 37 themes and subthemes for importance for students to understand and the level of difficulty for students on a 5-point Likert scale. The majority (28) of items evaluated were rated as either Essential or Important. Theme 2: cell membrane structure was rated as less important than the other three themes. Theme 4: membrane potential was rated most difficult, while theme 1: defining cell membranes was rated as the easiest. The importance of cell membranes as a key aspect of biomedical education received strong support from Australian educators. The unpacking of the themes and subthemes within the cell membrane core concept provides guidance in the development of curricula and should facilitate better identification of the more challenging aspects within this core concept and help inform the time and resources required to support student learning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The "cell membrane" core concept was unpacked by a team of Australian physiology educators into a conceptual framework to provide guidance for students and educators. Key themes in the cell membrane core concept were cell membrane definition and structure, transport across cell membranes, and membrane potentials. Australian educators reviewing the framework identified cell membrane as an essential yet relatively simple core concept, suggesting that this is well-placed in foundational physiology courses across a diverse range of degrees.

AB Academic dishonesty is prevalent in universities in the form of cheating on examinations, with the problem being much greater in classes that have a large number of students that require close seating arrangements for in-class exams. The scenario described below was experienced during an in-class exam that included the possibility of an Honor Code violation between two students that was observed independently by three different faculty proctors. Herein we detail an objective, statistical approach taken to maintain exam and academic integrity that is compelling and transparent to students and the University Honor Council. Using the established error-similarity analysis for multiple-choice exams, it was determined that the number of identical incorrect answers found on the exams of the two individuals in question was sufficiently greater than the number expected by chance (probability of P < 0.00001). The number of total identical incorrect answers found on the remaining exams (across 65 students, n = 89 comparisons) was plotted as function of the number of total incorrect answers found on these exams (incorrect answers ranged from 1 to 22) and clearly supported that there was an Honor Code violation between the two students in question. The techniques used herein established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a form of cheating had occurred between these students. However, caution must be taken as further investigation is requisite to establish whether the Honor Code violation was unidirec-tional (one student copying off the other) or bidirectional (collusion between the two students) in nature.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Academic dishonesty is prevalent in universities, especially on examinations with a large number of stu-dents in close seating arrangements. Cheating on a multiple-choice exam was suspected by observations from proctors of the examination. Application of error-similarity analysis associated with identical incorrect answers demonstrated that the probability of cheating was confirmed (P < 0.00001) between two examinees. Further comparisons with the remaining exams provided graphic evidence that a violation of the University's Honor Code had occurred.

AB Reflective narrative writing on unfolding ethics case vignettes has the potential to promote values like empathy among medical students, which will prove useful in their future. The objective of this study was to explore the scope of guided reflective narratives on unfolding ethics case vignettes integrated into physiology teaching to promote empathy among first-year medical students. First-year medical students (n = 150) were presented with unfolding case vignettes exploring ethical issues, as part of their physiology curriculum, with questions and prompts for a guided reflective narrative. Feedback about the program was obtained through a semistructured questionnaire. The contents of the students' reflective narratives and feedback were analyzed. The narratives revealed that students empathized with the various individuals involved in medical treatment and research, which was also reflected in student feedback (n = 116; 79%) and high Likert scale scores (74%). The program was considered effective by students in broadening their perspective and promoting critical thinking (n = 129; 88%). Through analysis of reflections, a rubric that would enable the evaluation of students' empathy on a scale of increasing ability to look at a situation from another's point of view emerged. This rubric could be used to quantitatively assess the impact of similar programs. Although divided in their individual opinions, the study population was able to relate to all individuals involved in medical practice and research, recognizing the need for fair and ethical practices. The content analysis led to the development of a rubric to grade empathy.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Unfolding case vignettes exploring ethical issues were introduced into the physiology curriculum of first-year medical students. The effectiveness of guided reflections following the case vignettes was explored. The analysis of the reflections and feedback on the program revealed that students became more empathetic. The reflections broadened their perspective and encouraged critical thinking. The analysis led to development of a rubric to grade the level of empathy, which can be used for quantitative assessment of empathy.

ID DJUNGARIAN HAMSTER; DYNAMIC ACTION
AB In endothermic mammals total energy expenditure (EE) is composed of basal metabolic rate (BMR), energy spent for muscle activity, thermoregulation, any kind of production (such as milk, meat, or egg production), and the thermic effect of feeding. The BMR is predominantly determined by body mass and the surface-to-volume ratio of the body. The EE can be quantified by either direct or indirect calorimetry. Direct calorimetry measures the rate of heat loss from the body, whereas indirect calorimetry measures oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and calculates heat production from oxidative nutrient combustion. A deep and sustainable understanding of EE in animals is crucial for veterinarians to properly calculate and evaluate feed rations during special circumstances such as anesthesia or in situations with increased energy demands as commonly seen in high-yielding livestock. The practical class described in this article provides an experimental approach to understanding how EE can be measured and calculated by indirect calorimetry. Two important factors that affect the EE of animals (the thermic effect of feeding and the effect of ambient temperature) are measured. A profound knowledge about the energy requirements of animal life and its measurement is also relevant for education in general biology, animal and human physiology, and nutrition. Therefore, this teaching unit can equally well be implemented in other areas of life sciences.

AB This sourcebook update describes a variation of a previous sourcebook experiment that used isolated extensor digitorum longus muscle from mouse to teach skeletal muscle properties (Head SI, Arber MS. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 405-414, 2013). Gastrocnemius-sciatic nerve preparation in an anaesthetized rat was developed and muscle contractions were recorded in a computerized data acquisition system using an isometric force transducer. Teachers and students in physiology or biology can use this preparation to demonstrate skeletal muscle properties like simple muscle twitch, quantal summation, wave summation, superposition, incomplete tetanus, complete tetanus, treppe, fatigue, and length-tension relationship.

DE backward design; nutritional sciences; redesign; undergraduate

AB Due to current and upcoming needs in the discipline and accreditation, the Nutritional Sciences faculty at a major university reformed their curriculum using backward design. As part of this process, they developed new learning outcomes that aligned to the institutional learning outcomes and mapped these new outcomes across the major's required courses. Also, they reorganized the existing major's single focus on biomedical nutrition into an academic program with a core curriculum and three concentrations (biomedical and molecular nutrition, global health and nutrition, and public health nutrition). The faculty designed new core and concentration courses and modified existing courses to distribute the essential learning across the major curriculum. Additionally, the committee created two service courses to fill voids in nutrition education for nonmajors. Despite abundant literature on backward and curriculum design, this process produced important learning about how to conduct and implement curriculum reform in a science-based discipline.

AB Undergraduate education should help students build a deep, conceptual understanding of their discipline, not merely compel them to acquire factual knowledge. The core concepts for physiology (described in 2011), conceptual frameworks, and conceptual assessments are available to focus undergraduate physiology education on helping students understand and apply principles that govern and describe physiological processes. We review the context in which physiology core concepts were identified by a community of physiology educators. We explain the structure of conceptual frameworks and concept inventories and their benefit. We describe how core concepts have been used in physiology courses and departments, as communicated in publications, through presentations at physiology and biology education meetings, and within the Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG). Finally, we share our recommendations and hopes for the next decade.

AB Throughout my academic career, I have been extremely fortunate to have as mentors, teachers, and advisors, remarkable individuals who helped me develop into a competent researcher and passionate teacher. This essay describes a period in my career as a graduate student that was challenging, but also rewarding. I was fortunate to have contact with world-class researchers and teachers, including Drs. Clyde Herried, Leon Fahri, Hermann Rahn. Donald Riggs, Verner Noell. and Barbara Howell. In addition, I attended excellent University of Buffalo Department of Physiology seminars presented by world-renown scientists. Looking back on the experience, allows me to appreciate the large impact they made on my subsequent career in education and research in physiology and neurobiology.

AB Physiology is commonly taught through direct experience and observation of scientific phenomena in "hands-on" practical laboratory classes. The value of such classes is limited by students' lack of understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts and their lack of confidence with the experimental techniques. In our experience, students follow experimental steps as if following a recipe, without giving thought to the underlying theory and the relationship between the experimental procedure and the research hypotheses. To address this issue, and to enhance student learning, we developed an online virtual experiment for students to complete before an inquiry-based practical. The virtual experiment and "live" practical laboratory were an investigation of how autonomic nerves control contractions in the isolated rabbit ileum. We hypothesized that the virtual experiment would support students' understanding of the physiological concepts, as well as the experimental design associated with the practical. Anonymous survey data and usage analytics showed that most students engaged with the virtual experiment. Students thought that it helped them to understand the practical physiological concepts and experimental design. with self-reported time spent on the virtual experiment (and not on lectures or practical class notes) a significant predictor of their understanding. This novel finding provides evidence that virtual experiments can contribute to students' research skills development. Our results indicate that self-paced online virtual experiments are an effective way to enhance student understanding of physiological concepts and experimental processes, allowing for a more realistic experience of the scientific method and a more effective use of time in practical classes.

ID CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE
AB One of the "important peculiarities" of human learning (Bjork RA and Bjork EL. From Learning Processes to Cognitive Processes: Essays in Honor of William K. Estes, 1992, p. 35-67) is that certain conditions that produce forgetting-that is, impair access to some to-be-learned information studied earlier-also enhance the learning of that information when it is restudied. Such conditions include changing the environmental context from when some to-be-learned material is studied to when that material is restudied; increasing the delay from when something is studied to when it is tested or restudied; and interleaving, rather than blocking, the study or practice of the components of to-be-learned knowledge or skills. In this paper, we provide some conjectures as to why conditions that produce forgetting can also enable learning, and why a misunderstanding of this peculiarity of how humans learn can result in nonoptimal teaching and self-regulated learning.

AB With increasing medical knowledge. procedural, and diagnostic skills to learn, it is vital for educators to make the limited amount of teaching time available to students effective and efficient. Generative retrieval is an effective and efficient learning tool, improving long-term retention through the practice of retrieval from memory. Forty medical students were randomized to learn normal cardiovascular anatomy using transthoracic echocardiography video clips in a generative retrieval (GR) or standard practice (SP) group. GR participants were required to verbally identify each unlabeled cardiovascular structure after viewing the video. After answering, participants viewed the correctly labeled video. SP participants viewed the same video clips labeled with the correct cardiovascular structure for the same amount of total time without verbally generating an answer. All participants were tested for intermediate (1-wk), late (1-mo), and long-term (6- to 9-mo) retention of cardiovascular anatomy. Additionally. a three-question survey was incorporated to assess perceptions of the learning method. There was no difference in pretest scores. The GR group demonstrated a trend toward improvement in recall at 1 wk [GR = 74.3 (SD 12.3); SP = 65.4 (SD 16.7); P = 0.10] and 1 mo [GR = 69.9 (SD15.6); SP = 64.3 (SD 15.4);P = 0.33]. At the 6- to 9-mo time point, there was a statistically significant difference in scores [GR = 74.3 (SD 9.9); SP = 65.0 (SD 14.1); P = 0.042]. At nearly every time point, learners had a statistically significantly higher perception of effectiveness, enjoyment. and satisfaction with GR. In addition to improved recall, GR is associated with increased perceptions of effectiveness, enjoyment. and satisfaction, which may lead to increased engagement, time spent studying, and improved retention.

AB Physiology demands systems thinking: reasoning within and between levels of biological organization and across different organ systems. Many physiological mechanisms explain how structures and their properties interact at one level of organization to produce emergent functions at a higher level of organization. Current physiology principles, such as structure-function relations, selectively neglect mechanisms by not mentioning this term explicitly. We explored how students characterized mechanisms and functions to shed light on how students make sense of these terms. Students characterized mechanisms as 1) processes that occur at levels of organization lower than that of functions; and 2) as detailed events with many steps involved. We also found that students produced more variability in how they characterized functions compared with mechanisms: students characterized functions in relation to multiple levels of organization and multiple definitions. We interpret these results as evidence that students see mechanisms as holding a more narrow definition than used in the biological sciences, and that students struggle to coordinate and distinguish mechanisms from functions due to cognitive processes germane to learning in many domains. We offer the instructional suggestion that we scaffold student learning by affording students opportunities to relate and also distinguish between these terms so central to understanding physiology.

AB A simple "stop think" approach was developed to encourage the self-assessment of learning. A key element was the requirement for students to rate their feeling of difficulty before [FOD(pre)] and after [FOD(post)] completing each of three authentic anatomy and physiology concept map exercises. The cohort was divided into low-(group L) and highperforming (group H) groups (based on final subject marks). Both FOD(pre) (group L) and FOD(post) (groups L and H) were significantly negatively correlated with score for some maps. A comparison of FOD(pre) and FOD(post) showed that students changed their mind about difficulty in 58-70% of the completed maps. Students who changed their estimation were asked to provide explanatory comments, and an increase in difficulty was related to problems with map link generation. For students who found the maps easier, 40% of comments indicated that map generation prompted recall of information from memory. Both difficulty estimations and comments supported the contention that students were self-assessing their interaction with the concept maps. Group H was significantly older than group L, had significantly higher levels of deep strategic and deep motivational learning, and had significantly higher marks in two of three concept map exercises. Notwithstanding these differences, the results from the "stop think" approach were similar between groups, indicating that it may be appropriate for students of varying academic ability. It is suggested that "stop think" may be a useful approach to encourage student self-assessment, an important step in assisting self-regulated learning development.

AB Early establishment of physiological societies in Oklahoma and Ohio demonstrated the benefits of networking physiologists and paved the way for establishing the APS Chapter Program. Designed to promote the general objectives of the APS, the Chapter Program was officially launched in 1995, with Ohio being the first recognized chapter. There are 13 active chapters regularly engaged in numerous activities designed to advance physiology education and research. In the hopes that others will recognize the important offerings of state chapters and consider organizing one, the aims for this paper are to 1) share a brief history, 2) provide rationale for chapter initiation, and 3) describe the process involved in establishing a chapter. In light of current changes in American Medical Association and Liaison Committee on Medical Education guidelines, the present time may be critical in promoting chapters, as they play a vital role in sustaining recognition and support for the discipline.

FX Special thanks and tribute to Dr. Peter Lauf who worked passionately and
   collaboratively with Dr. Frank to establish the Chapter Program. Due
   largely to Dr. Lauf's efforts, Ohio became the first APS recognized
   chapter, and Dr. Lauf would go on to serve as the first chapter and CAC
   president. Dr. Lauf and his spouse Norma have provided encouragement,
   counsel, and personal financial support to fledgling chapters. The duo
   have attended several state's annual meetings and sponsored student
   awards. Their presence and contribution have been inspiring as they
   visit with students and offer words of encouragement and advice (as well
   as ask probing questions!). APS chapters are making a difference at the
   grass roots levels. Thank you, Dr. Lauf, for your vision, passion, and
   work to support the APS Chapter Program.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE lecture; attention; note taking; clickers
AB In the current climate of curriculum reform, the traditional lecture has come under fire for its perceived lack of effectiveness. Indeed, several institutions have reduced their lectures to 15 min in length based upon the "common knowledge" and "consensus" that there is a decline in students' attention 10-15 min into lectures. A review of the literature on this topic reveals many discussions referring to prior studies but scant few primary investigations. Alarmingly, the most often cited source for a rapid decline in student attention during a lecture barely discusses student attention at all. Of the studies that do attempt to measure attention, many suffer from methodological flaws and subjectivity in data collection. Thus, the available primary data do not support the concept of a 10- to 15-min attention limit. Interestingly, the most consistent finding from a literature review is that the greatest variability in student attention arises from differences between teachers and not from the teaching format itself. Certainly, even the most interesting material can be presented in a dull and dry fashion, and it is the job of the instructor to enhance their teaching skills to provide not only rich content but also a satisfying lecture experience for the students.

AB In international surveys, Brazilian students have been consistently ranking low in science. Continuing education for secondary school teachers is certainly a way to change this situation. To update teachers and provide teaching and learning experiences for graduate students, our department organized a "Winter Course in Physiology" where schoolteachers had the opportunity to attend lectures that were offered by graduate students and participate in discussions on teaching and learning strategies and their applicability, considering different schools and student age groups. This work evaluated the ways in which the Winter Course in Physiology improves continuing education for secondary school teachers. Graduate students prepared, presented, and discussed with the audience the concepts, content, and topics of the program, which were previously presented to the organizing committee and a supervising professor. Potential participants were recruited based on their curriculum vitae and a letter of intent. During the course, they completed a questionnaire that graded different aspects of course organization and lectures. The results indicated that the Winter Course was positively evaluated. Most topics received a grade of >= 4.0, considering a range of 1.0 (low) to 5.0 (high). In a followup, both the participants and instructors reported positive impacts on their overall knowledge in physiology. Schoolteachers reported improvements in the performance and participation of their students. In conclusion, the results suggested that the Winter Course is a good way to promote continuing education for schoolteachers and promote university outreach. It also provided an important experience for graduate students to develop teaching skills.

AB In the present article, a veteran lecturer of human anatomy and physiology taught several sections of the laboratory component for the first time and shares his observations and analysis from this unique perspective. The article discusses a large-enrollment, content-heavy anatomy and physiology course in relationship to published studies on learning and student self-efficacy. Changes in the laboratory component that could increase student learning are proposed. The author also points out the need for research to assess whether selective curricular changes could increase the depth of understanding and retention of learned material.

AB The goal of the present study was to determine whether an active learning/teaching strategy facilitated with mobile technologies can improve students' levels of memory retention of key physiological concepts. We used a quasiexperimental pretest/posttest nonequivalent group design to compare the test performances of second-year medical students (n = 311) taught by conventional didactic methods (traditional group) with those involved in a case-based problem-solving learning approach facilitated with mobile phones as web-based "clickers" (experimental group). Using their cell phones, students answered the same questions about the key physiological concepts three times. A pretest to determine their baseline knowledge was followed by two followup tests after 1 wk and 2 mo, respectively. The experimental group scored a mean of 93.2% correct items after 1 wk and 84.8% correct items after 2 mo [95% confidence intervals: (89.4, 97.0) and (79.4, 90.3), respectively]. Compared with their colleagues in the traditional group who scored 33.3% [95% confidence interval: (18.9, 47.8)] and 38.5% [95% confidence interval: (23.6, 53.4)] correct items, respectively, this was a significant increase of similar to 50% (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, for the experimental group, Cohen's effect size (d) values of d = 1.67 (1-wk posttest) and d = 1.38 (2-mo posttest) suggested a very high practical significance. In contrast, in the traditional group, Cohen's d values of d = 0.04 (1-wk posttest) and d = 0.15 (2-mo posttest) assumed a very low practical significance.

AB Undergraduate exercise physiology is a ubiquitous course in undergraduate kinesiology/exercise science programs with a broad scope and depth of topics. It is valuable to explore what is taught within this course. The purpose of the present study was to facilitate an understanding of what instructors teach in undergraduate exercise physiology, how it compares with various guidelines, and to continue the conversation regarding what should be taught. A survey was created using course outcomes from the American Society of Exercise Physiologists, National Association for Sport and Physical Education, Ivy's 2007 Quest article, the National Athletic Training Association, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, and 36 undergraduate exercise physiology course syllabi. The 134-item survey was disseminated to individuals who use exercise physiology: university faculty members, clinical exercise physiologists, researchers, and other practitioners on various exercise physiology lists; 2,009 surveys were sent, and 322 surveys were completed (16% rate of return). There was a high degree of agreement about a lot of important content in undergraduate exercise physiology. Instructors of exercise physiology should focus their curriculum on regulation and homeostasis (including adaptation, fatigue, and recovery), aerobic systems, bioenergetics, muscle physiology, and fitness principles. In addition, attention should be paid to performance and technical skills. In conclusion, it is up to exercise physiologists to ensure quality of knowledge and practice. Doing so will improve the uniformity and quality of practitioners within the various kinesiology/exercise science fields and increase the value of a Kinesiology/Exercise Science degree and set it apart from other healthcare providers and fitness professionals.

AB The relationships among the scores of major subjects taught in the first preclinical year of a Thai medical school, previous academic achievements, and daily life activities are rarely explored. We therefore performed an exploratory study identifying various factors possibly related to the educational scores of these medical students. Questionnaires were sent out to all first preclinical year medical students, with 79.8% being returned (245/307 questionnaires). Positive correlations were revealed between the premedical year grade point average (pre-MD GPA) and anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry scores (R = 0.664, 0.521, and 0.653, respectively, P < 0.001 for all) by Pearson's method. Using multiple linear regression analysis, anatomy scores could be predicted by pre-MD GPA, student satisfaction with anatomy, the percentage of expected reading, monthly earnings, reading after class and near exam time, and duration of sleeping periods near exam time (R = 0.773, R-2 = 0.598, P < 0.001). Physiology scores could be estimated by pre-MD GPA, the percentage of expected reading, monthly earnings, and percentage of those who fell asleep during class and near exam time (R = 0.722, R-2 = 0.521, P < 0.001). Biochemistry scores could be calculated by pre-MD GPA, the percentage of expected reading, motivation to study medicine, student satisfaction with biochemistry, and exam performance expectations (R = 0.794, R-2 = 0.630, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pre-MD GPA and the percentage of expected reading are factors involved in producing good academic results in the first preclinical year. Anatomy and biochemistry, but not physiology, scores are influenced by satisfaction.

AB Tipton CM. Recognition of American Physiological Society members whose research publications had a significant impact on the discipline of physiology. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 15-27, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00145.2012.-Society members whose research publication during the past 125 yr had an important impact on the discipline of physiology were featured at the American Physiological Society (APS)'s 125th Anniversary symposium. The daunting and challenging task of identifying and selecting significant publications was assumed by the Steering Committee of the History of Physiology Interest Group, who requested recommendations and rationales from all Sections, select Interest Groups, and active senior APS members. The request resulted in recommendations and rationales from nine Sections, one Interest Group, and 28 senior members, identifying 38 publications and 43 members for recognition purposes. The publication recommendations included 5 individuals (Cournand, Erlanger, Gasser, Hubel, and Wiesel) whose research significantly contributed to their selection for the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology, 4 individuals who received multiple recommendations [i.e., Cannon (3), Curran (2), Fenn (3), and Hamilton (2)], and 11 members who had been APS Presidents. Of the recommended articles, 33% were from the American Journal of Physiology, with the earliest being published in 1898 (Cannon) and the latest in 2007 (Sigmund). For the brief oral presentations, the History of Physiology Steering Committee selected the first choices of the Sections or Interest Group, whereas rationales and representation of the membership were used for the presentations by senior members.

AB Ipata PL. Origin, utilization, and recycling of nucleosides in the central nervous system. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 342-346, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00068.2011.-The brain relies on the salvage of preformed purine and pyrimidine rings, mainly in the form of nucleosides, to maintain its nucleotide pool in the proper qualitative and quantitative balance. The transport of nucleosides from blood into neurons and glia is considered to be an essential prerequisite to enter their metabolic utilization in the brain. Recent lines of evidence have also suggested that local extracellular nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) degradation may contribute to brain nucleosides. Plasma membrane-located ectonucleotidases, with their active sites oriented toward the extracellular space, catalyze the successive hydrolysis of NTPs to their respective nucleosides. Apart from the well-established modulation of ATP, ADP, adenosine (the purinergic agonists), UTP, and UDP (the pyrimidinergic agonists) availability at their respective receptors, ectonucleotidases may also serve the local reutilization of nucleosides in the brain. After their production in the extracellular space by the ectonucleotidase system, nucleosides are transported into neurons and glia and converted back to NTPs via a set of purine and pyrimidine salvage enzymes. Finally, nucleotides are transported into brain cell vescicles or granules and released back into the extracellular space. The key teaching concepts to be included in a two-to three-lecture block on the molecular mechanisms of the local nucleoside recycling process, based on a cross talk between the brain extracellular space and cytosol, are discussed in this article.

AB Korzick DH. From syncitium to regulated pump: a cardiac muscle cellular update. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 22-27, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00119.2010.-The primary purpose of this article is to present a basic overview of some key teaching concepts that should be considered for inclusion in an six-to eight-lecture introductory block on the regulation of cardiac performance for graduate students. Within the context of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, this review incorporates information on Ca2(+) microdomains and local control theory, with particular emphasis on the role of Ca2(+) sparks as a key regulatory component of ventricular myocyte contraction dynamics. Recent information pertaining to local Ca2(+) cycling in sinoatrial nodal cells (SANCs) as a mechanism underlying cardiac automaticity is also presented as part of the recently described coupled-clock pacemaker system. The details of this regulation are emerging; however, the notion that the sequestration and release of Ca2(+) from internal stores in SANCs (similar to that observed in ventricular myocytes) regulates the rhythmic excitation of the heart (i.e., membrane ion channels) is an important advancement in this area. The regulatory role of cardiac adrenergic receptors on cardiac rate and function is also included, and fundamental concepts related to intracellular signaling are discussed. An important point of emphasis is that whole organ cardiac dynamics can be traced back to cellular events regulating intracellular Ca2(+) homeostasis and, as such, provides an important conceptual framework from which students can begin to think about whole organ physiology in health and disease. Greater synchrony of Ca2(+) -regulatory mechanisms between ventricular and pacemaker cells should enhance student comprehension of complex regulatory phenomenon in cardiac muscle.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 76-81, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00042.2010.-The maximal rate of O-2 consumption (V-O2max) constitutes one of the oldest fitness indexes established for the measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and aerobic performance. Procedures have been developed in which VO2max is estimated from physiological responses during submaximal exercise. Generally, VO2max is estimated using the classical renowned Astrand-Ryhming test. In young adults, poor fitness and low aerobic performance are often associated with a sedentary lifestyle, which is a well-described factor for the development of obesity and its related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In the Indian Ocean, the inhabitants of La Reunion Island, a French overseas department, exhibit an increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. At the University of La Reunion, a new laboratory course involving students was designed to teach the indirect evaluation of their VO2max from the classical Astrand-Ryhming test and using a cycle ergometer as the exercise mode. Inverse and significant correlations were established between the students' fat mass percentages and their VO2max and between their waist-to-hip ratio and VO2max as well. Results from the international physical activity questionnaire showed that most participants in this laboratory were sedentary students. Therefore, this laboratory makes the students practice and understand the use of a classical test to estimate their VO2max. It also alerts them to the correlation between a sedentary lifestyle and higher body fat content. This exercise allowed students to use a scientific method to engage the problem of sedentary lifestyle, which is a real world issue.

AB Student-constructed drawings can give insight into student understanding, and misunderstandings, of core concepts about the cell membrane.
   Students in an animal physiology course are required to have completed prerequisite cell biology and genetics courses that include discussion of basic properties and functions of the cell membrane. However, while many students remember basic information about membrane structure, they often have difficulty relating that structure to membrane functions, such as vesicular transport, active transport, osmosis, and current flow across the membrane. To better understand what students recall about the cell membrane, students were given an open-ended prompt to draw what they know about the structure and function of the animal cell membrane. This activity was repeated 1-2 weeks after finishing discussion of the cell membrane in class, with an emphasis on the concepts of membrane transport and a related core concept, flow along gradients. Student responses were analyzed using the conceptual framework for the "cell membrane" core concept published by Michael and Modell (Michael J, Modell H. Adv Physiol Educ 43: 373-377, 2019). Before covering this content in class, the majority of submissions included a representation of the cell membrane as a phospholipid bilayer, and a high percentage also included membrane proteins or the fluid mosaic model. Similar percentages of students included these concepts in the postcoverage drawing. However, other components of the conceptual framework were included less frequently or not at all before covering the content in class but improved dramatically afterward. This activity provides information about what students recall from prior coursework and which concepts need to be revisited, and it can provide a complementary assessment of student understanding of the core concept of the cell membrane.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Student-constructed drawings can give insight into student understanding, and misunderstandings, of core concepts about the cell membrane.

AB Why are my students not paying attention in class? Why are they not engaged? What am I doing wrong? These are questions that even seasoned faculty pose in moments of self-reflection. Although it is good practice for educators to continually evaluate their presentations for areas of improvement, it is unfortunately also true that questions of why students lack attention or engagement in class are often raised by school administrators as subtle implications of failure on the part of faculty. But why is it so hard for our students to pay attention? Why is it that students' focus can so easily ebb away during a class? Why are my students seemingly indifferent to the presented material? To address these issues, and to provide solutions that can be incorpo-rated easily into class preparation and presentation, it is important to define precisely what we mean by attention and engage-ment. Are they the same thing, and if not, how do they differ? To what extent is the student responsible for acquiring and applying the material presented? Ultimately, of course, the student is accountable for learning the material and passing exams, but there are practices that we as educators often employ that erect hurdles and barriers to student learning, that can make the process significantly harder than it needs to be.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although many articles and books exist describing various classroom strategies to increase student engagement, often advice to newer faculty is given as prescriptive ways to organize a class or to repeat what was given by the last person who presented the material. Yet irrespective of the structure of the class or learning environment, there are subtle hurdles that many faculty erect that hinder a student's progress. This Personal View discusses some of the potential barriers educators put up that deter effective student learning and, importantly, offers advice on how those barriers can be dismantled.

AB Captain America can bring more than entertainment value to the public. The pop icon can also be used effectively in the science classroom, encouraging students to more effectively learn the content. How Captain America uses nutrients and how often he eats are novel ways to communicate real science. The point is to make a connection using science to explain how the superhero can run faster, jump higher, or lift more than is humanly possible. In this way fun, teachable moments are available for the educator.

AB There is evidence that demonstrates that teaching preclinical and clinical material can have numerous benefits for both students and teachers, with the majority of literature focusing on peer medical student teaching. There is a dearth of literature exploring the benefit of medical students teaching undergraduate, pre-health professional students and using clinical cases in this setting. We explore our implementation of a team-based learning curriculum built around clinical cases to teach advanced physiology and introduce pathology, pharmacology, and interprofessional collaboration for pre-health students. This course was entirely taught by medical students. Course evaluations and future implications are discussed.

AB Bolstered by evidence of the health benefits of exercise, health professionals advise their patients about it. Thus these professionals should have a basic knowledge of exercise physiology. In Brazil, a graduate degree is not mandatory, so for many health providers, the only opportunity to receive information on exercise physiology content is during their undergraduate study. Therefore, it is imperative that health science undergraduate programs include content on exercise physiology. The aim of the study was to verify the presence of exercise physiology (or similar coursework) in the curricula of seven health science undergraduate programs (biomedicine, physical education, nursing, physiotherapy, medicine, nutrition, and psychology). The study was divided into three phases: 1) a survey of the total number of undergraduate programs (n = 4,940) through an electronic system of the Brazilian Ministry of Education (e-MEC); 2) a random selection of 10% of the total undergraduate programs (n = 494) for further analysis of the curriculum; and 3) analysis of the curricula of the selected undergraduate programs. Of 494 undergraduate programs, we did not find curricula for 77 of them. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 417 undergraduate programs. In total, 65.9% of the undergraduate programs did not offer coursework in exercise physiology. The chi-square test revealed a significant association between undergraduate curricula in health science and the presence or absence of exercise physiology coursework [X-2(6, n = 417) = 293.0, P < 0.0001]. We did not find exercise physiology coursework in most of the analyzed undergraduate programs. Alternatives to solve the lack of exercise physiology coursework would be the inclusion of content related to exercise physiology in professional/graduate education or in continuing education programs.

TI A new model for organizing curriculum alignment initiatives
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Editorial Material
DE alignment; core concepts; curriculum; database; physiology; standards
AB The author discusses the benefits of curriculum alignment and the development of a new database system called e-CMS (electronic curriculum mapping system) for organizing curriculum alignment initiatives. Fundamental to the systematic organization of curriculum is understanding the interplay between three alignment factors present in all courses: assessments, TLAs (teaching and learning activities), and objectives, also known as the triadic model of alignment. Also important to this process is the inclusion of external alignment factors, such as cognitive level, professional skills, and the core concepts of physiology. When organized properly, alignment of internal and external factors provides a common language for discussing and comparing courses across departments and institutions. Databases such as e-CMS not only help organize curriculum, but also offer almost unlimited ways to combine, analyze, and share resultant data. This could provide value to students and their future employers by communicating with confidence the evidence-based knowledge, skills, and abilities gained in a course or program. The next phase of the alignment initiative that produced e-CMS is to develop a distributed online database for housing and sharing aligned assessments.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The flipped classroom has become increasingly popular in health professions education. The aim of this study was to analyze its effect on learning in a pathophysiology course. Flipped classroom was introduced to teach respiratory pathophysiology in 2018. We compared the exam results in respiratory pathophysiology in 2017 and 2018 and the exam results in blood pathophysiology from both years (taught by the same teacher, in a traditional way). Groups were compared with Student's t test. Students answered a survey after finishing the term. Two hundred and one students were examined in 2018 (and 229 in 2017). Gender distribution and the qualifications obtained in general pathology (in the previous year) were comparable in both years. Results in respiratory pathophysiology were significantly better in 2018 than in 2017 (mean: 48 vs. 42 out of 100; P = 0.004), but the results in blood pathophysiology remained similar. The improvement was significant only in students who scored below the median (mean: 40 vs. 33; P = 0.009) and was more evident in male than in female students (mean: 52 vs. 44; P = 0.01) and in those who did not have an academic delay (mean 51 vs. 44; P = 0.002). Most students considered that flipped classroom was more attractive and helped them to learn more and with less effort. Flipped classroom increased medical students' knowledge acquisitions in pathophysiology. It was more beneficial to male students and those with lower qualifications with no academic delay.

AB The Physiology Understanding (PhUn) Week is a national outreach event sponsored by the American Physiological Society. Our PhUn team conducted an event for 551 students (12.5 +/- 0.9 yr old) in a middle school in Indiana. The aims of this program were to: 1) teach about the negative consequences of inactivity on cardiovascular (CV) health and overall well-being; 2) help students to determine their own CV fitness level and design their fitness plan; and 3) test the hypothesis that students who are offered daily physical education (PE) classes are able to meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The University of Louisville PhUn team visited the school during school hours to execute the outreach program to students enrolled in Health and PE as their course elective. During the event, students were educated about CV physiology and the effects of exercise on CV fitness and metabolism. Additionally, students were asked to completed a questionnaire about their physical activity behaviors outside the school. Students were also educated about ways to increase energy expenditure by 150 METy (units of metabolism for youth) per day during 7 days. CV fitness levels were estimated by using the PACER (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run) test, and students were asked to create a plan to increase energy expenditure daily. The results showed that 53% of the students did not perform enough physical activity outside school to meet the guidelines. In conclusion, the incorporation of PE in schools is critical to cultivate healthy lifestyles and decrease the sedentarism epidemic in the U.S.

AB Since fall 2015, the University of Virginia's (UVA) Engineering Student Council (ESC) has partnered with the nonprofit Virginia Science Olympiad (VASO) organization to host a Science Olympiad (SciOly) state tournament in Charlottesville, Virginia, each spring. This annual tournament brings over 2.000 middle and high school students, teachers, and parents to the UVA campus, and teams of 15-17 people from roughly 90 schools across Virginia participate in 46 different events (23 middle school, Division B; 23 high school, Division C) relating to the science, technology. engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields throughout the day-long competition. The national SciOly organization sets the events and rules to comply with national education standards, and the VASO board coordinates the teams and tournaments within the state. By collaborating with VASO, UVA ESC was able to plan a large-scale SciOly tournament at UVA in approximately 10 mo with the support of the UVA School of Engineering and Applied Science. Since this event was planned and executed solely by undergraduates in cooperation with the nonprofit organization, there were institutional hurdles that were overcome through the months of planning. The Virginia SciOly state tournament has continued to be held at UVA with the support and cooperation of the UVA ESC and VASO, and bringing this tournament to UVA has allowed for increased excitement for participating K-12 students and a mitigated burden to the VASO organizers in planning the state competition. This paper aims to provide a resource for other universities to support STEM activities in K-12 outreach organizations. like SciOly, in the future.

ID CURRICULA
AB The primary purpose of conducting two interprofessional education (IPE) experiences during a multidisciplinary physiology graduate-level course was to provide basic science, physical therapy, and physician assistant graduate students opportunities to work as a team in the diagnosis, treatment, and collaborative care when presented with a patient case focused on acute kidney injury (first case) and female athlete triad (second case). The secondary purpose was to apply basic physiology principles to patient case presentations of pathophysiology. The overall purpose was to assess the longitudinal effects and the value of IPE integrated within a basic science course. The following Interprofessional Education Collaborative subcompetencies were targeted: roles/responsibilities (RR1. RR4). Students were given a pre- and postsurvey to assess their IPE perceptions and knowledge of professional roles. There were statistically significant increases from the presurvey renal IPE experience to the presurvey endocrine IPE experience for two perception questions regarding the ability to explain the roles and responsibilities of a physical therapist (PT) and physician assistant using a Likert scale. In addition, student knowledge of the role of a PT increased significantly when comparing the renal IPE presurvey to the endocrine IPE presurvey results to open-ended questions. Students' perceptions of their knowledge as well as their ability to express, in writing, their newly learned knowledge of the role of a PT was sustained over lime. Incorporating multiple WE experiences into multidisciplinary health science courses represents an appropriate venue to have students learn and apply interprofessional competencies.

AB Dr. James McCune Smith, the first African-American to obtain a medical degree, has a remarkable legacy of historical proportions, yet his immense impact on society remains relatively unknown. He may be most celebrated for his effectiveness in abolitionist politics, however, his pioneering influence in medicine is equally remarkable. As examples, McCune Smith pioneered the use of medically based statistics to challenge the notion of African-American racial inferiority. He scientifically challenged the racial theories promoted in Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (Jefferson T., 1832), and he was a harsh critic of phrenology (study of the shape and size of the cranium as a supposed indication of character and mental abilities). Furthermore, notwithstanding being denied entry to America's universities and medical societies because of his race, McCune Smith became a giving physician to orphans, an accomplished statistician, medical author, and social activist who worked to end slavery. His pioneering work debunked doubts about the ability of African-Americans to transition into free society. Specifically, he used his training in medicine and statistics to refute the arguments of slave owners and prominent thought leaders that African-Americans were inferior and that slaves were better off than free African-Americans or white urban laborers. Frederick Douglass, narrator of the Anti-Slavery Movement, cited Dr. James McCune Smith as the single most important influence on his life. Dr. McCune Smith, along with Frederick Douglass, Gerrit Smith, John Brown and other intellectual pioneers of the time, were instrumental in making the elimination of slavery possible.

ID ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES
AB Physiology courses are considered to be challenging for students to master due to the highly conceptual nature of the discipline and the substantial cognitive effort required to understand disciplinary knowledge. Students must choose appropriate learning strategies to develop their understanding, as their choices may influence both their understanding and their academic achievement. The primary aim of this study was to develop an understanding of why students experience difficulties with physiology and how they respond when facing the challenge of learning this discipline. Undergraduate allied health students (n = 231) studying physiology were asked to identify the topics they had difficulty understanding, the strategies they used to deal with that difficult knowledge, and the reasons for their difficulties. Consenting students' responses were subjected to inductive and deductive thematic analyses, and their performance on examinations were collated. Students reported that they found physiology difficult due to their lack of familiarity with it and the level of detail required. To aid their understanding of difficult topics, students commonly reported reviewing information, seeking further information, and seeking social assistance, with more high-achieving students reporting reviewing records, and fewer reporting seeking social assistance than poor-achieving students. Most notably, a disconnect was found between students' reporting of difficult modules and their academic achievement on those modules, with students who cited difficulties performing equally well, if not better, than those who do not. Importantly, these findings suggest that students, in recognizing their difficulties and the reasons for them, can implement effective learning strategies to overcome them.

AB The rapid development of mobile phones and communication networks is profoundly changing the lives of people in China. With the gradual growth of Wi-Fi on college and university campuses, Chinese schools are setting off a wave of teaching reform combining online material with traditional classroom instruction. We adapted a Chinese University massive open online course physiology course into a private university online course, specifically designed for second-semester bachelor's level nursing students at Taishan Medical University. This online course blended with classroom teaching was offered to 108 freshmen from two parallel reform classes. A third class of 55 students was offered the traditional classroom lecture-based course as a control. Impressive teaching effects were achieved in reform classes, as indicated by significant improvement in student performance on the final examination and positive student feedback. The student surveys showed that 68% of students preferred the blended course over traditional classroom courses. The most highly rated advantages of the blended course were flexible learning time (84%) and improvement of independent study skills (75%). As higher education enters the internet era, exploiting the high-quality cyber resources may be the fastest and most economical way to improve teaching efficiency and enhance students' study experience.

AB Similar to human beings, pain is an unpleasant sensation experienced by animals as well. There is no exception when the animals are subjected to experimental procedures. Our duty as researchers/scientists is to prevent or minimize the pain in animals so as to lessen their suffering and distress during experimental procedures. The basics of the physiology of pain and pain perception, analgesia, anesthesia, and euthanasia of laboratory animals were included to complete the program, before the practical part was attempted and before advanced topics, such as comparison of anesthetic combinations, were discussed. Therefore, this course was organized in Sri Lanka for the first time in collaboration with the Comparative Biology Centre of Newcastle University, UK. During this course, we were able to demonstrate how an anesthesia machine could be used in laboratory animal anesthesia for the first time in the country. None of the animal houses in the country were equipped with an anesthesia machine at the time of conducting the course.

AB The present study examined the relationship between second-year medical students' group performance and individual performance in a collaborative-learning environment. In recent decades, university professors in the scientific and humanistic disciplines have successfully put into practice different modalities of collaborative approaches to teaching. Essentially, collaborative approach refers to a variety of techniques that involves the joint intellectual effort of a small group of students, which encourages interaction and discussion among students and professors. The present results show the efficacy of collaborative learning, which, furthermore, allowed students to participate actively in the physiology class. Average student's grades were significantly higher when they engaged in single-best-response, multiple-choice tests as a student team, compared with taking the same examinations individually. The method improved notably knowledge retention, as learning is more effective when performed in the context of collaborative partnership. A selected subset of questions answered wrongly in an initial test, both individually and collectively, was used on a second test to examine student retention of studied material. Grade averages were significantly improved, both individually and groupwise, when students responded to the subset of questions a second time, 1, 2, or 3 wk after the first attempt. These results suggest that the collaborative approach to teaching allowed a more effective understanding of course content, which meant an improved capacity for retention of human physiology knowledge.

AB This article reminisces about the life and key scientific achievements of Jan Evangelista Purkinje (1787-1869), a versatile 19th century Czech pioneer of modern experimental physiology. In 1804, after completing senior high school, Purkinje joined the Piarist monk order, but, after a 3-yr novitiate, he gave up the religious calling "to deal more freely with science." In 1818, he earned a Medical Doctor degree from Prague University by defending a dissertation on intraocular phenomena observed in oneself. In 1823, Purkinje became a Physiology and Pathology professor at the Prussian Medical University in Breslau, where he innovated the traditional teaching methods of physiology. Purkinje's contributions to physiology were manifold: accurate descriptions of various visual phenomena (e.g., Purkinje-Sanson images, Purkinje phenomenon), discovery of the terminal network of the cardiac conduction system (Purkinje fibers), identification of cerebellar neuronal bodies (Purkinje cells), formulation of the vertigo law (Purkinje's law), discovery of criteria to classify human fingerprints, etc. In 1850, Purkinje accepted and held until his death the Physiology chair at Prague Medical Faculty. During this period, he succeeded in introducing the Czech idiom (in addition to long-established German and Latin) as a Medical Faculty teaching language. Additionally, as a zealous Czech patriot, he actively contributed to the naissance and consolidation of a national Czech identity conscience. Purkinje was a trend-setting scientist who, throughout his career, worked to pave the way for the renovation of physiology from a speculative discipline, ancilla of anatomy, into a factual, autonomous science committed to the discovery of mechanisms governing in-life functions.

AB Most assessments of physiology in medical school use multiple choice tests that may not provide information about a student's critical thinking (CT) process. There are limited performance assessments, but high-fidelity patient simulations (HFPS) may be a feasible platform. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether a group's CT process could be observed over a series of HFPS. An instrument [ Critical Thinking Skills Rating Instrument CTSRI)] was designed with the IDEAS framework. Fifteen groups of students participated in three HFPS that consisted of a basic knowledge quiz and introduction, HFPS session, and debriefing. HFPS were video recorded, and two raters reviewed and scored all HFPS encounters with the CTSRI independently. Interrater analysis suggested good reliability. There was a correlation between basic knowledge scores and three of the six observations on the CTSRI providing support for construct validity. The median CT ratings significantly increased for all observations between the groups' first and last simulation. However, there were still large percentages of video ratings that indicated students needed substantial prompting during the HFPS. The data from this pilot study suggest that it is feasible to observe CT skills in HFPS using the CTSRI. Based on the findings from this study, we strongly recommend that first-year medical students be competent in basic knowledge of the relevant physiology of the HFPS before participating, to minimize the risk of a poor learning experience.

AB Scientific writing requires a distinct style and tone, whether the writing is intended for an undergraduate assignment or publication in a peer-reviewed journal. From the first to the final draft, scientific writing is an iterative process requiring practice, substantial feedback from peers and instructors, and comprehensive proofreading on the part of the writer. Teaching writing or proofreading is not common in university settings. Here, we present a collection of common undergraduate student writing mistakes and put forth suggestions for corrections as a first step toward proofreading and enhancing readability in subsequent draft versions. Additionally, we propose specific strategies pertaining to word choice, structure, and approach to make products more fluid and focused for an appropriate target audience.

AB The membrane potential, arising from uneven distribution of ions across cell membranes containing selectively permeable ion channels, is of fundamental importance to cell signaling. The necessity of maintaining the membrane potential may be appreciated by expressing Ohm's law as current = voltage/resistance and recognizing that no current flows when voltage = 0, i.e., transmembrane voltage gradients, created by uneven transmembrane ion concentrations, are an absolute requirement for the generation of currents that precipitate the action and synaptic potentials that consume >80% of the brain's energy budget and underlie the electrical activity that defines brain function. The concept of the equilibrium potential is vital to understanding the origins of the membrane potential. The equilibrium potential defines a potential at which there is no net transmembrane ion flux, where the work created by the concentration gradient is balanced by the transmembrane voltage difference, and derives from a relationship describing the work done by the diffusion of ions down a concentration gradient. The Nernst equation predicts the equilibrium potential and, as such, is fundamental to understanding the interplay between transmembrane ion concentrations and equilibrium potentials. Logarithmic transformation of the ratio of internal and external ion concentrations lies at the heart of the Nernst equation, but most undergraduate neuroscience students have little understanding of the logarithmic function. To compound this, no current undergraduate neuroscience textbooks describe the effect of logarithmic transformation in appreciable detail, leaving the majority of students with little insight into how ion concentrations determine, or how ion perturbations alter, the membrane potential.

AB The process of developing effective science educators has been a long-standing objective of the broader education community. Numerous studies have recommended not only depth in a teacher's subject area but also a breadth of professional development grounded in constructivist principles, allowing for successful student-centered and inquiry-based instruction. Few programs, however, have addressed the integration of the scientific research laboratory into the science classroom as a viable approach to professional development. Additionally, while occasional laboratory training programs have emerged in recent years, many lack a component for translating acquired skills into reformed classroom instruction. Given the rapid development and demand for knowledgeable employees and an informed population from the biotech and medical industries in recent years, it would appear to be particularly advantageous for the physiology and broader science education communities to consider this issue. The goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development program focused on the integration of reformed teaching principles into the classrooms of secondary teachers. This was measured through the program's ability to instill in its participants elevated academic success while gaining fulfillment in the classroom. The findings demonstrated a significant improvement in the use of student-centered instruction and other reformed methods by program participants as well as improved self-efficacy, confidence, and job satisfaction. Also revealed was a reluctance to refashion established classroom protocols. The combination of these outcomes allowed for construction of an experiential framework for professional development in applied science education that supports an atmosphere of reformed teaching in the classroom.

AB Ultrasound is being incorporated more into undergraduate medical education. Studies have shown that medical students have positive perceptions about the value of ultrasound in teaching courses like anatomy and physiology. The purpose of the present study was to provide objective evidence of whether ultrasound helps students learn cardiac physiology. In this study, 20 medical students took a pretest to assess their background knowledge of cardiac physiology. Next, they acquired ultrasound video loops of the heart. Faculty members taught them nonelectrical aspects of cardiac physiology using those loops. Finally, students took a posttest to evaluate for improvements in their knowledge. Students also completed an anonymous questionnaire about their experience. The mean pretest score was 4.8 of 9 (53.3%). The mean posttest score was 7.35 of 9 (81.7%). The mean difference was significant at P < 0.0001. Student feedback was very positive about the ultrasound laboratory. Ninety-five percent of the students agreed or strongly agreed that the ultrasound laboratory was a valuable teaching tool and that it improved their understanding of cardiac physiology. All students agreed or strongly agreed the laboratory was helpful from a visual learning standpoint. A hands-on ultrasound laboratory can indeed help medical students learn the nonelectrical components of cardiac physiology.

ID RETRIEVAL; RETENTION; EXPLANATION
AB Dozens of studies have found learning strategies based on the "testing effect" promote greater recall than those that rely solely on reading; however, the advantages of testing are often only observed after a delay (e.g., 2-7 days later). In contrast, our research, which has focused on kinesiology students learning kinesiology information that is generally familiar to them, has consistently demonstrated that testing-based strategies produce greater recall both immediately and after a delay. In an attempt to understand the discrepancies in the literature, the purpose of the present study was to determine if the time-related advantages of a testing-based learning strategy vary with one's familiarity with the to-be-learned information. Participants used both read-only and testing-based strategies to repeatedly study three different sets of information: 1) previously studied human muscle information (familiar information), 2) a mix of previously studied and previously unstudied human muscle information (mixed information), and 3) previously unstudied muscle information that is unique to sharks (unfamiliar information). Learning was evaluated via free recall assessments administered immediately after studying and again after a 1-wk delay and a 3-wk delay. Across those three assessments, the read-only strategy resulted in mean scores of 29.26 +/- 1.43, 15.17 +/- 1.29, and 5.33 +/- 0.77 for the familiar, mixed, and unfamiliar information, respectively, whereas the testing-based strategy produced scores of 34.57 +/- 1.58, 16.90 +/- 1.31, and 8.33 +/- 0.95, respectively. The results indicate that the testing-based strategy produced greater recall immediately and up through the 3-wk delay regardless of the participants' level of familiarity with the muscle information.

AB The Medical Council of India, in the recent Vision 2015 document, recommended curricular reforms for undergraduates. Case-based learning (CBL) is one method where students are motivated toward self-directed learning and to develop analytic and problem-solving skills. An overview of thyroid physiology was given in a didactic lecture. A paper-based case scenario of multinodular goiter was given to phase I Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students in two sessions. An attitude survey of the students and teachers was done using a Likert scale ranging from strongly disagrees to strongly agree. A pretest and posttest were conducted. The students opined that CBL helped them to better their understanding of a particular topic, gave them better retention of knowledge, helped them to relate clinical conditions to basic sciences, improved soft skills such as communication skills and group dynamics, and promoted a better teacher-student relationship. There was significant improvement in student's performance when pre- and posttest scores were compared (P = 0.018). Furthermore, faculty members opined that CBL promoted self-study and problem-solving abilities of the students. In conclusion, CBL motivates students toward self-directed learning and to develop analytic and problem-solving skills; thus, CBL could be beneficial for students' entry into clinical departments and, finally, in managing patients.

AB Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This ninth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the analysis of ratios and normalized- or standardized-data. As researchers, we compute a ratio-a numerator divided by a denominator-to compute a proportion for some biological response or to derive some standardized variable. In each situation, we want to control for differences in the denominator when the thing we really care about is the numerator. But there is peril lurking in a ratio: only if the relationship between numerator and denominator is a straight line through the origin will the ratio be meaningful. If not, the ratio will misrepresent the true relationship between numerator and denominator. In contrast, regression techniques-these include analysis of covariance-are versatile: they can accommodate an analysis of the relationship between numerator and denominator when a ratio is useless.

AB A number of professions rely on exercise prescription to improve health or athletic performance, including coaching, fitness/personal training, rehabilitation, and exercise physiology. It is therefore advisable that the professionals involved learn the various tools available for designing effective training programs. Mathematical modeling of athletic training and performance, which we henceforth call "performance modeling," is one such tool. Two models, the critical power (CP) model and the Banister impulse-response (IR) model, offer complementary information. The CP model describes the relationship between work rates and the durations for which an individual can sustain them during constant-work-rate or intermittent exercise. The IR model describes the dynamics by which an individual's performance capacity changes over time as a function of training. Both models elegantly abstract the underlying physiology, and both can accurately fit performance data, such that educating exercise practitioners in the science of performance modeling offers both pedagogical and practical benefits. In addition, performance modeling offers an avenue for introducing mathematical modeling skills to exercise physiology researchers. A principal limitation to the adoption of performance modeling is a lack of education. The goal of this report is therefore to encourage educators of exercise physiology practitioners and researchers to incorporate the science of performance modeling in their curricula and to serve as a resource to support this effort. The resources include a comprehensive review of the concepts associated with the development and use of the models, software to enable hands-on computer exercises, and strategies for teaching the models to different audiences.

AB Luckie DB, Aubry JR, Marengo BJ, Rivkin AM, Foos LA, Maleszewski JJ. Less teaching, more learning: 10-yr study supports increasing student learning through less coverage and more inquiry. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 325-335, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00017.2012.-In this study, we compared gains in student content learning over a 10-yr period in which the introductory biology laboratory curriculum was changed in two ways: an increase of inquiry and a reduction of content. Three laboratory formats were tested: traditional 1-wk-long cookbook laboratories, two 7-wk-long inquiry laboratories, and one 14-wk-long inquiry laboratory. As the level of inquiry increased, student learning gains on content exams trended upward even while traditional content coverage taught decreased. In a quantitative assessment of content knowledge, students who participated in the 14-wk-long inquiry laboratory format outscored their peers in both 7- and 1-wk-long lab formats on Medical College Admissions Test exam questions (scores of 64.73%, 61.97%, and 53.48%, respectively, P < 0.01). In a qualitative study of student opinions, surveys conducted at the end of semesters where traditional 1-wk laboratories (n = 167 students) were used had low response rates and predominately negative opinions (only 20% of responses were positive), whereas those who participated in 7-wk (n = 543) or 14-wk (n = 308) inquiry laboratories had high response rates and 71% and 96% positive reviews, respectively. In an assessment of traditional content coverage in courses, three indexes were averaged to calculate traditional forms of coverage and showed a decrease by 44% over the study period. We believe that the quantitative and qualitative data support greater student-driven inquiry in the classroom laboratory, which leads to deeper learning in fewer topic areas (less teaching) and can reap gains in scientific thinking and fundamental understanding applicable to a broader range of topic areas (more learning) in introductory biology.

AB Berg RM, Plovsing RR, Damgaard M. Teaching baroreflex physiology to medical students: a comparison of quiz-based and conventional teaching strategies in a laboratory exercise. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 147-153, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00011.2012.-Quizbased and collaborative teaching strategies have previously been found to be efficient for the improving meaningful learning of physiology during lectures. These approaches have, however, not been investigated during laboratory exercises. In the present study, we compared the impact of solving quizzes individually and in groups with conventional teaching on the immediate learning during a laboratory exercise. We implemented two quizzes in a mandatory 4-h laboratory exercise on baroreflex physiology. A total of 155 second-year medical students were randomized to solve quizzes individually (intervention group I, n = 57), in groups of three to four students (intervention group II, n = 56), or not to perform any quizzes (control; intervention group III, n = 42). After the laboratory exercise, all students completed an individual test, which encompassed two recall questions, two intermediate questions, and two integrated questions. The integrated questions were of moderate and advanced difficulty, respectively. Finally, students completed an evaluation form. Intervention group I reached the highest total test scores and proved best at answering the integrated question of advanced difficulty. Moreover, there was an overall difference between groups for student evaluations of the quality of the teaching, which was highest for intervention group II. In conclusion, solving quizzes individually during a laboratory exercise may enhance learning, whereas solving quizzes in groups is associated with higher student satisfaction.

AB Horton DM, Wiederman SD, Saint DA. Assessment outcome is weakly correlated with lecture attendance: influence of learning style and use of alternative materials. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 108-115, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00111.2011.-The relation between lecture attendance and learning is surprisingly weak, and the role of learning styles in this is poorly understood. We hypothesized that 1) academic performance is related to lecture attendance and 2) learning style influences lecture attendance and, consequently, affects performance. We also speculated that the availability of alternative resources would affect this relationship. Second-year Bachelor of Science physiology students (n = 120) self-reported their lecture attendance in a block of 21 lectures (attendance not compulsory) and use of alternative resources. Overall self-reported lecture attendance was 73 +/- 2%. Female students (n = 71) attended more lectures (16.4 +/- 0.6) than male students (14.3 +/- 0.08, n = 49) and achieved a higher composite mark in all assessments (73.6% vs. 69.3%, P < 0.02). Marks in the final exam were not statistically different between the sexes and correlated only weakly with lecture attendance (r = 0.29, n = 49, P < 0.04 for male students; r = 0.10, n = 71, P = not significant for female students; and r = 0.21, n = 120, P < 0.02 for the whole class). Of the students who passed the exam, poor attenders (<11 lectures) reported significantly more use of lecture recordings (37 +/- 8%, n = 15, vs. 10 +/- 1%, n = 85, P < 0.001). In a VARK learning style assessment (where V is visual, A is auditory, R is reading/writing, and K is kinesthetic), students were multimodal, although female students had a slightly higher average percentage of the R learning style (preferred read/write) compared with male students (28.9 +/- 0.9%, n = 63, vs. 25.3 +/- 1.3%, n = 32, P < 0.03). Lecture attendance was not correlated with measured learning style. We concluded that lecture attendance is only weakly correlated with academic performance and is not related to learning style. The substitution of alternative materials for lecture attendance appears to have a greater role than learning style in determining academic outcomes.

AB Morris NP, Ramsay L, Chauhan V. Can a tablet device alter undergraduate science students' study behavior and use of technology? Adv Physiol Educ 36: 000-000, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00104.2011.-This article reports findings from a study investigating undergraduate biological sciences students' use of technology and computer devices for learning and the effect of providing students with a tablet device. A controlled study was conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data on the impact of a tablet device on students' use of devices and technology for learning. Overall, we found that students made extensive use of the tablet device for learning, using it in preference to laptop computers to retrieve information, record lectures, and access learning resources. In line with other studies, we found that undergraduate students only use familiar Web 2.0 technologies and that the tablet device did not alter this behavior for the majority of tools. We conclude that undergraduate science students can make extensive use of a tablet device to enhance their learning opportunities without institutions changing their teaching methods or computer systems, but that institutional intervention may be needed to drive changes in student behavior toward the use of novel Web 2.0 technologies.

AB Giuliodori MJ, Lujan HL, Janbaih H, DiCarlo SE. How does a hopping kangaroo breathe? Adv Physiol Educ 34: 228-232, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00050.2010.-We developed a model to demonstrate how a hopping kangaroo breathes. Interestingly, a kangaroo uses less energy to breathe while hopping than while standing still. This occurs, in part, because rather than using muscle power to move air into and out of the lungs, air is pulled into (inspiration) and pushed out of (expiration) the lungs as the abdominal organs "flop" within the kangaroo's body. Specifically, as the kangaroo hops upward, the abdominal organs lag behind, and the insertion of the diaphragm is pulled toward its origin, flattening the dome and increasing the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity (the thoracic cavity and lungs enlarge). Increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity reduces alveolar pressure below atmospheric pressure (barometric pressure), and air moves into the alveoli by bulk flow. In contrast, the impact of the organs against the diaphragm at each landing causes expiration. Specifically, upon landing, the abdominal organs flop into the diaphragm, causing it to return to its dome shape and decreasing the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity. This compresses the alveolar gas volume and elevates alveolar pressure above barometric pressure, so air is expelled. To demonstrate this phenomenon, the plunger of a syringe model of the respiratory system was inserted through a compression spring. Holding the syringe and pressing the plunger firmly against a hard surface expels air from the lungs (the balloon within the syringe deflates) and compresses the spring. This models the kangaroo landing after a hop forward. Subsequently, the compression spring provides the energy for the "kangaroo" to "hop" forward upon the release of the syringe, and air enters the lungs (the balloon within the syringe inflates). The model accurately reflects how a hopping kangaroo breathes. A model was chosen to demonstrate this phenomenon because models engage and inspire students as well as significantly enhance student understanding.

AB Brown PJ. Process-oriented guided-inquiry learning in an introductory anatomy and physiology course with a diverse student population. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 150-155, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00055.2010.-Process-oriented guided-inquiry learning (POGIL), a pedagogical technique initially developed for college chemistry courses, has been implemented for 2 yr in a freshman-level anatomy and physiology course at a small private college. The course is populated with students with backgrounds ranging from no previous college-level science to junior and senior biology, biochemistry, and forensic science majors. Fifty percent of the lectures in the course were replaced with POGIL activities, performed in class by students working collaboratively in small groups. The introduction of POGIL pedagogy into the second half of a two-semester anatomy and physiology course significantly improved student performance on summative evaluations. Overall course scores increased from a mean score of 76% to 89% in the three semesters after POGIL was introduced. Performance on the same multiple-choice final exam rose from a mean of 68% to 88% over the same time period. Most significantly, the rate of students earning a D or F in the course was halved in the first two semesters after POGIL was introduced and was 0% in the third semester. Student satisfaction with the method was high, and most students perceived the value of this form of instruction.

AB An Australia-wide consensus was reached on seven core concepts of physiology, one of which was cell-cell communication. Three physiology educators from a "core concepts" Delphi task force "unpacked" this core concept into seven different themes and 60 subthemes. Cell-cell communication, previously unpacked and validated, was modified for an Australian audience to include emerging knowledge and adapted to increase student accessibility. The unpacked hierarchical framework for this core concept was rated by 24 physiology educators from separate Australian universities, using a five-point scale for level of importance for student understanding (ranging from 1 = Essential to 5 = Not Important) and level of difficulty (ranging from 1 = Very Difficult to 5 = Not Difficult). Data were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test. The seven themes were rated within a narrow range of importance (1.13-2.4), with ratings of Essential or Important, and statistically significant differences between the themes (P < 0.0001, n = 7). The variance for the difficulty rating was higher than for importance, ranging from 2.15 (Difficult) to 3.45 (between Moderately Difficult and Slightly Difficult). Qualitatively, it was suggested that some subthemes were similar and that these could be grouped. However, all themes and subthemes were ranked as Important, validating this framework. Once finalized and adopted across Australian universities, the unpacked core concept for cell-cell communication will enable the generation of tools and resources for physiology educators and improvements in consistency across curricula.

AB Chinese universities have been conducting a variety of sexuality education programs, including a sexuality curriculum (SC) to increase sexual and reproductive health (SRH) knowledge and improve sexual attitudes and practices among college students. However, little is known regarding the effect of SC on students' sexual attitudes and behaviors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of SC on SRH knowledge, sexual attitudes, and practices among college students of Shandong University. To assess these issues, an online cross-sectional survey was conducted via a WeChat applet. Four hundred and forty-nine freshmen were recruited from Shandong University, including 209 students with SC and 240 students without SC. We assessed their SRH knowledge, sexual attitude, and practice. We found that 15.8% engaged in sexual activities, while 59.2% had viewed nonscientific books or videos describing sexual behavior within the past 2 weeks. Regarding the initial source of their SRH information, 65.9% taught themselves through reading or viewing SRH content in the media, and 46.8% participated in school lectures on SRH, while only 31.2% of the participants discussed SRH matters with their parents. As compared with students without SC, students with SC had significantly greater total scores with regard to reproductive health knowledge (P < 0.001) and sexual health knowledge (P < 0.001). Students without SC showed a significant degree of prejudice against sexually transmitted disease patients and were more resistant to interact with acquaintances infected with human immunodeficiency virus (P < 0.001). Exposure to a school-based SC had a beneficial effect on increasing the SRH knowledge of these students as well as mitigating risky sexual attitudes and behaviors.NEW & NOTEWORTHY To assess the SRH knowledge, sexual attitudes, and practices in freshmen of Shandong University and assess the effect of SC, an online cross-sectional survey was conducted via a WeChat applet. Our findings indicate that these freshmen demonstrate a high prevalence of being sexually active and exposure to a school-based SC had a beneficial effect on increasing the SRH knowledge of these students as well as mitigating risky sexual attitudes and behaviors.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic led to the suspension of in-person learning at many higher education institutions (HEls) in March 2020. In response, HEIs transitioned most courses to online formats immediately and continued this mode of instruction through the 2020-2021 academic year. In fall 2021, numerous HEIs resumed in-person courses and some hybrid courses, and faculty began noting academic-related behavior deficiencies not previously observed in students. Focus groups of teaching faculty (n = 8) from one university department were conducted to gather information on changes in student academic-related behaviors attributed to the disruption of teaching and learning due to COVID-19 and to compare observed deficiencies with the university's undergraduate learning goals. Mind mapping software was utilized to capture themes and sub-themes. Identified themes were related to problem-solving skills, grades, time management, attendance, and interpersonal communication, both in terms of student-to-student and student-to-faculty communication. For these identified areas, outcomes during the return to in-person learning were mostly undesirable. Based on these identified issues, suggested modifications that HEIs could use to modify course content and delivery to offset skill gaps and improve interpersonal communication were identified. Furthermore, observations may indicate that fully remote learning inhibited student learning and skill development during the 2020-2021 academic year. Future work should examine the effectiveness of the proposed modifications on student success.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article contains information gathered from mind map-driven faculty focus group observations of student academic-related deficiencies resulting from transitioning from remote to in-person learning and how said deficiencies compare to university undergraduate learning goals.

AB There is a widely variable breadth of coverage of skeletal muscle content across both undergraduate human anatomy and undergraduate anatomy and physiology (A&P) courses. In response to the need for a more global understanding of the content taught in undergraduate anatomy courses, we developed an online survey (administered through Qualtrics) where both human anatomy and A&P faculty could report skeletal muscle coverage in their courses. The survey also collected comparative demographic institutional data such as the type of institution (community college vs. 4 year), course format, and geographic location of the undergraduate institution. Skeletal muscles surveyed included those listed and described in a typical undergraduate human anatomy text (McKinley MP, O'Loughlin VD, Pennefather O. Human Anatomy (5th ed.), 2017, p. 960). The data indicated some interesting instructional trends regarding muscular system coverage. First, both the "identification" and "action" of specific muscles are taught at a higher frequency than the teaching of either "attachments or innervation." Innervation of specific skeletal muscles is the least taught concept. In each body region, certain muscles were taught with higher frequency than others. This research shows there is a global trend in teaching identification of specific skeletal muscles within each body region and often this is accompanied by teaching actions of said muscles. These general instructional trends may increase our understanding of the anatomical and physiological education our undergraduate students are receiving and will lead to further critical conversations about content development and curriculum.

AB Blended course designs have been increasingly adopted in medical education. However, research on the relations between the key aspects of students' learning experience and their learning outcomes often only measures students' self-reported experience, neglecting what they actually do in learning. This study combined both self-reported and observational measures of students' learning experiences and examined the relations between the two sets of measures and their contributions to learning outcomes. Australian medical students were asked to report their approaches to, and perceptions of, learning. The frequency and duration of their interactions with both online formative and summative tasks were observed and recorded. Correlation analyses showed that the learning outcome was positively related to deep approaches to using online technologies and duration of interactions with online summative tasks. The hierarchical multiple regression analysis found that the self-reported approaches and duration of interactions jointly explained the learning outcomes, accounting for 6% of the variance. The study demonstrated the complementary nature of using both self-reported and observational measures of students' learning experiences to explain the learning outcomes in blended course designs.

AB The College of Science and Health Professions offers a university preprofessional program. Like most medical schools in Saudi Arabia, the teaching delivery strategy in the university preprofessional program is on campus and face-to-face. During the month of March 2020, teaching activities of the spring semester were proceeding as normal; however, the sudden emergence of COVID-19 disturbed routine activities and compelled authorities to switch all teaching activities from face-to-face to online. Training sessions and workshops for all stakeholders on online delivery methods were arranged. Blackboard and other online facilities were utilized. All teaching materials, including newly made video clips for anatomy and physiology practicals, were uploaded on Blackboard and discussed online with students. Students' anxiety related to the exam was reassured by giving them the option of open book quizzes during summative continuous assessment. All scheduled teaching sessions, lectures, and practicals were conducted proficiently. Revision sessions and assessment quizzes were conducted with students' satisfaction. At the end of the semester, a final exam was conducted online as an open book exam. Students with technical issues while attempting the exam were given an opportunity to make up for it. After a successful final exam, the cumulative block grades showed students secured higher grades in the open book exam. Following that, the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences has managed to conduct on-campus close book exams that abide by self-distancing and standard operating procedure policies.

AB While many professional societies, colleges, and universities offer undergraduate summer research experience (URE) programs for students, few have systematically evaluated their programs for impacts on the fellows. The American Physiological Society (APS) developed and administered multiple UREs with varying target groups: students with and without prior research experiences and students from disadvantaged groups, including underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities (URM), persons with disabilities, first generation college students, and persons with financial or social disadvantages. Each program had specific goals and measurable objectives. To assess the impact of these programs, APS both documented student completion of program tasks (e.g., designing experiments, analyzing data, writing abstracts) and developed reliable and valid survey instruments to quantify students' self-ratings on a variety of research and career planning skills related to the program objectives. Results indicate that fellows as a whole and for most individual programs gained skills and knowledge in numerous areas: experimental design, data management, lab safety, statistical analysis, data presentation, scientific writing, scientific presentation, professional networking, professional networking at scientific meetings, authorship attribution, animal use in research, human subjects in research, roles of lab mates and mentors, and research career training and planning. Furthermore, there were few differences within the diversity comparison groups (women vs. men, URM fellows vs. non-URM fellows, etc.). Suggestions for improvement of URE programs are proposed.

AB A novel educational tool helps teach intestinal absorption in physiology-We have designed an interesting educational tool to help sophomores learn intestinal absorption in physiology course. In the study group (2019), 51 sophomores from biomedical engineering were encouraged to learn the intestinal absorption knowledge through reading materials and group discussion. Then, using the form of flipped class, they stepped on the podium and simulated and explained the absorption processes with designed paper props as educational tool. In contrast, the control group (2018), 52 sophomores from the same specialty had taken the same professional courses before. The result of theoretical test showed the average score in the study group was higher than that in the control group. The questionnaire analysis showed the positive role of the education tool in their learning efficacy. To sum up, using our tool has achieved better teaching effects than the traditional lecture.

AB Working memory is critical for learning but has a limited capacity for processing new information in real time. Cognitive load theory is an evidence-based approach to education that seeks to minimize the extraneous (unnecessary) load on working memory to avoid overloading it. The "seductive details effect" postulates that extraneous load can come from instructional design materials that attract interest but are unrelated to, and impair, learning. Presentation packages, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, have built-in decorative animated "GIFs" that are designed to make presentations more visually appealing. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of such "decorative" animations on learning and working memory performance. We found that students were less able to recall content presented in the presence of a decorative but relevant animation compared with a still image. This effect was found with two different topics (human physiology and enzyme kinetics). Compared with still images, students also found it harder to remember animations themselves, and the self-reported mental workload required to remember them was higher. These results show that decorative animations are seductive details and are thus a source of extraneous cognitive load.

ID INTRINSIC MOTIVATION
AB Peer evaluation skills are not typically taught to students, yet they are expected to provide high-quality feedback to their peers. Gameful learning, a pedagogy supporting student-driven learning, can further reinforce the development of peer evaluation skills, if students are motivated to improve upon them. To better understand the effects of a peer evaluation training on the quality of student-generated peer evaluations, we scored peer evaluations from two cohorts taking a graduate-level nutritional sciences class using gameful learning pedagogy. The intervention group completed a peer evaluation training before engaging in peer reviews, while the control group did not. The training included two readings, a video, and reflection questions. The peer evaluations submitted by both the intervention and control groups were assessed on a validated rubric. The peer evaluation training had a positive effect on the quality of the submitted peer evaluations. The intervention group had a 10.8% higher score on its first submitted peer evaluation compared with controls (P = 0.003). The intervention group improved the quality of its future submissions by a further 8.9%, whereas the controls did not continue to improve substantially (P < 0.001). Overall, peer review training enhanced the quality of peer evaluations and allowed students to develop professional skills that they can utilize in any biomedical profession. Our results highlight the importance of peer evaluation training in combination with repeated practice and student-driven learning brought forth by gameful learning pedagogy in improving the quality of evaluations and developing professional skills.

AB Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) continue to work to increase the diversity of the fields, yet there are still significant historical and societal hurdles to be overcome before we reach full representation throughout STEM. The concept of science identity has become a point of interest in this process; it has been suggested that development of one's identity as a scientist is critical to persistence in the field. Metaphors that are rooted in bodily experience can provide a starting point to understand abstract concepts, including science identity and how we as STEM educators respond to increasing diversity within our fields. Given the history of STEM being predominantly populated by people who are white and male, disorientation or discomfort with increasing diversity is not unexpected, and many women and people of color report discrimination and marginalization as a part of their experience in STEM. Here I present a neuroscience-based metaphor that can serve as a starting point for understanding some of the potential disorientation or discomfort that we may experience as we engage with the increasing diversity of STEM and acknowledge this experience as a normal but temporary part of the process of growth and development as a field. I encourage the development and use of further discipline-based metaphors to enhance our discussion and understanding of this important work.

AB Fractal physiology demonstrated growing interest over the last decades among physiologists, neuroscientists, and clinicians. Many physiological systems coordinate themselves for reducing variability and maintain a steady state. When recorded over time, the output signal exhibits small fluctuations around a stable value. It is becoming increasingly clear that these fluctuations, in most free-running healthy systems, are not simply due to uncorrelated random errors and possess interesting properties, one of which is the property of fractal dynamics. Fractal dynamics model temporal processes in which similar patterns occur across multiple timescales of measurement. Smaller copies of a pattern are nested within larger copies of the pattern, a property termed scale invariance. It is an intriguing process that may deserve attention for implementing curricular development for students to reconsider homeostasis. Teaching fractal dynamics needs to make calculating resources available for students. The present paper offers a calculating resource that uses a basic formula and is executable in a simple spreadsheet. The spreadsheet allows computing detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), the most frequently used method in the literature to quantify the fractal-scaling index of a physiological time series. DFA has been nicely described by the group at Harvard that designed it; the authors made the C language source available. Going further, it is suggested here that a guide to build DFA step by step in a spreadsheet has many advantages for teaching fractal physiology and beyond: 1) it promotes the DIY (do-it-yourself) in students and highlights scaling concepts; and 2) it makes DFA available for people not familiarized with executing code in C language.

AB Walter B. Cannon (1871-1945), perhaps America's preeminent physiologist, volunteered for service with the Army Expeditionary Force (AEF) during World War I. He initially served with Base Hospital No. 5, a unit made up of Harvard clinicians, before moving forward to the front lines to serve at a casualty clearing station run by the British. During his time there, he performed research on wounded soldiers to understand the nature and causes of traumatic shock. Subsequently, Cannon performed animal experimentation on the causes of traumatic shock in the London laboratory of Dr. William Bayliss before being assigned to the AEF Central Medical Laboratory in Dijon, France, where he continued his experimental studies. During this time, he also developed and taught a curriculum on resuscitation of wounded soldiers to medical providers. Although primarily a researcher and teacher, Cannon also performed clinical duties throughout the war, serving with distinction under fire. After the war, Cannon wrote a monograph entitled Traumatic Shock (New York: Appleton, 1923), which encapsulated the knowledge that had been gained during the war, both from direct observation of wounded soldiers, as well as laboratory experimentation on the causes and treatment of traumatic shock. In his monograph, Cannon elucidates a number of principles concerning hemorrhagic shock that were later forgotten, only to be "rediscovered" during the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. This paper summarizes Cannon's wartime experiences and the knowledge gained concerning traumatic shock during World War I, with a comparison of current combat casualty care practices and knowledge to that which Cannon and his colleagues understood a century ago.

AB Real patients offer unique opportunities to develop authentic, engaging, and transformative learning experiences for students. Patients are widely employed to teach clinical and interpersonal skills in the clerkship phase of their medical education (M3-M4), but have not been extensively included in the preclinical curriculum (M1-M2) when students are focused on acquiring foundational biomedical science knowledge. To maximize learning and help students connect foundational and clinical science concepts to real-world clinical problems, we involved a real patient in the creation and implementation of a case-based learning (CBL) activity in our preclinical curriculum. Using the patient's narrative as a framework, the CBL addressed relevant aspects of physiology, pathophysiology, anatomy, pharmacology, and nutrition, as well as clinical care decisions, health literacy, and medical ethics. The intervention was implemented with the 2019 and 2020 graduating medical school classes during the Gastrointestinal Systems course in the second year of our curriculum. The results of a survey revealed that, overall, a majority of the students agreed or strongly agreed that the activity increased engagement in class, increased the depth of discussion within their teams, increased the depth of discussion between teams, helped students to apply basic science concepts to the clinical material in the case, helped students better understand the disease processes described in the case, enhanced awareness of the complexity of patient care, provided an authentic learning experience, and elicited a feeling of empathy.

ID MODEL
AB A good understanding of red cell indexes can aid medical students in a considerable manner, serving as a basis to unravel both concepts in red cell physiology and abnormalities associated with the same. In this study, we tried to assess whether an interactive animation was helpful in improving student comprehension and understanding of red cell indexes compared with conventional classroom teaching. Eighty-eight first-year MBBS students participated, of which 44 were assigned to group A and 44 were assigned to group B after randomization. After further creation of smaller groups, students were provided with 45 min to revise red cell indexes, after which they were required to complete a multimodal questionnaire. Group A subgroups used written material for revision, whereas group B subgroups had access to an interactive animation. After completion of the questionnaire, group A students also used the animation after which feedback was collected from all students. Efficacy of the animation to improve learning and retention was demonstrated, as group B students scored significantly higher than group A students on the questionnaire (P = 0.0003). A clear majority of the students agreed/strongly agreed that the animation was easy to operate, conveyed important concepts efficiently, and improved their knowledge of related clinical aspects as well. From the results and feedback, we found that the animation was a simple, well-received model, which, by significantly improving student performance, corroborated our hypothesis that inclusion of interactive animation into student curriculum can advance their academic attainment, compared with didactic teaching alone.

AB Course-level learning objectives and core concepts for undergraduate physiology teaching exist. The next step is to consider how these resources fit into generalizable program-level guidelines for Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees in Physiology. In the absence of program-level guidelines for Physiology degree programs, we compiled a selective internal report to review degree requirements from 18 peer BS programs entitled "Physiology" in the United States (U.S.). There was a range of zero to three required semesters of math, physics, physics laboratory, general biology, biology laboratory, general chemistry, chemistry laboratory, organic chemistry, organic chemistry laboratory, biochemistry, biochemistry laboratory, anatomy, anatomy laboratory, core systems physiology, and physiology laboratory. Required upper division credits ranged from 11 to 31 and included system-specific, exercise and environmental, clinically relevant, pathology/disease-related, and basic science options. We hope that this information will be useful for all programs that consider themselves to be physiology, regardless of name. Reports such as this can serve as a starting point for collaboration among BS programs to improve physiology undergraduate education and best serve our students.

The American Physiological Society (APS) Teaching Section has developed a biennial Institute on Teaching and Learning (ITL) through the APS Conference Program to address these issues. The first institute was held in June 2014, and the second institute was held in June 2016. A Physiology Education Community of Practice (PECOP) was created to help connect the institute participants and other physiology educators and to share evidence-based teaching in physiology at all education levels. The 2018 APS ITL will be the next meeting to learn best practices, to share ideas with colleagues, and to find collaborators in improving the teaching of physiology for students. The meeting will include workshops modeling best practices, plenary talks about hot new issues in physiology and science education, and poster sessions and informal meals to discuss interests with colleagues. Even if one's primary responsibility is bench research or administration, the training from the institute will improve efficiency and effectiveness when teaching. The two prior ITLs (2014 and 2016) were highly evaluated by educators of both undergraduate and professional students who spent a week together emphasizing improvement in their teaching. This paper reports the outcomes of the 2016 ITL and encourages participation in the upcoming ITL in Madison, WI, June 18-22, 2018. Watch the APS Conference site for more information about the 2018 ITL (http://www.theaps.org/mm/Conferences/APS-Conferences).

AB The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to model the changes in preload, afterload, and contractility on a simulated pressure- volume loop and to correlate those findings with common measurements of clinical cardiovascular physiology. Once students have modeled these changes on a healthy heart, the students are asked to look at a simulated case of cardiogenic shock. Effects on preload, contractility, and afterload are explored, as well as the hemodynamic effects of a number of student- suggested treatment strategies.

AB Drawings are an underutilized assessment format in Human Anatomy and Physiology (HA&P), despite their potential to reveal student content understanding and alternative conceptions. This study used student-generated drawings to explore student knowledge in a HA&P course. The drawing tasks in this study focused on chemical synapses between neurons, an abstract concept in HA&P. Using two preinstruction drawing tasks, students were asked to depict synaptic transmission and summation. In response to the first drawing task, 20% of students (n = 352) created accurate representations of neuron anatomy. The remaining students created drawings suggesting an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of synaptic transmission. Of the 208 inaccurate student-generated drawings, 21% depicted the neurons as touching. When asked to illustrate summation, only 10 students (roughly 4%) were able to produce an accurate drawing. Overall, students were more successful at drawing anatomy (synapse) than physiology (summation) before formal instruction. The common errors observed in student-generated drawings indicate students do not enter the classroom as blank slates. The error of "touching" neurons in a chemical synapse suggests that students may be using intuitive or experiential knowledge when reasoning about physiological concepts. These results 1) support the utility of drawing tasks as a tool to reveal student content knowledge about neuroanatomy and neurophysiology; and 2) suggest students enter the classroom with better knowledge of anatomy than physiology. Collectively, the findings from this study inform both practitioners and researchers about the prevalence and nature of student difficulties in HA&P, while also demonstrating the utility of drawing in revealing student knowledge.

AB The introduction of PowerPoint presentation software has generated a paradigm shift in the delivery of lectures. PowerPoint has now almost entirely replaced chalkboard or whiteboard teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This study investigated whether undergraduate biology students preferred to have lectures delivered by PowerPoint or written on the board as well as the reasons behind their preference. Two upper-division physiology courses were surveyed over a period of 7 yr. A total of 1,905 students (86.7%) indicated they preferred lectures delivered by "writing on the board" compared to 291 students (13.3%) who preferred PowerPoint. Common themes drawn from explanations reported by students in favor of writing on the board included: 1) more appropriate pace, 2) facilitation of note taking, and 3) greater alertness and attention. Common themes in favor of PowerPoint included 1) increased convenience, 2) focus on listening, and 3) more accurate and readable notes. Based on the students' very strong preference for writing on the board and the themes supporting that preference, we recommend that instructors incorporate elements of the writing on the board delivery style into whatever teaching modality is used. If instructors plan to use PowerPoint, the presentation should be paced, constructed, and delivered to provide the benefits of lectures written on the board. The advantages of writing on the board can be also incorporated into instruction intended to occur outside the classroom, such as animated narrated videos as part of the flipped classroom approach.

AB We developed an alternative approach to teach diabetes mellitus in our practical classes, replacing laboratory animals. We used custom rats made of cloth, which have a ventral zipper that allows stuffing with glass marbles to reach different weights. Three mock rats per group were placed into metabolic cages with real food and water and with test tubes containing artificial urine, simulating a sample collection of 24 h. For each cage, we also provided other test tubes with artificial blood and urine, simulating different levels of hyperglycemia. The artificial "diabetic" urine contained different amounts of anhydrous glucose and acetone to simulate two different levels of glycosuria and ketonuria. The simulated urine of a nondiabetic rat was prepared without the addition of glucose or acetone. An Accu-Chek system is used to analyze glycemia, and glycosuria and ketonuria intensity were analyzed by means of a Urocolor bioassay. In the laboratory classroom, students were told that they would receive three rats to find out which one has type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. To do so, they had to weigh the animals, quantify the water and food ingestion, and analyze the artificial blood and urine for glycemia, glycosuria, and ketonuria. Only at the end of class did we reveal that the urine and blood were artificial. Students were instructed to plot the data in a table, discuss the results within their group, and write an individual report. We have already used this practical class with 300 students, without a single student refusing to participate.

AB The study of human bioscience is viewed as a crucial curriculum in allied health. Nevertheless, bioscience (and particularly physiology) is notoriously difficult for undergraduates, particularly academically disadvantaged students. So endemic are the high failure rates (particularly in nursing) that it has come to be known as "the human bioscience problem." In the present report, we describe the outcomes for individual success in studying first-year human physiology in a subject that emphasises team-based active learning as the major pedagogy for mastering subject learning outcomes. Structural equation modeling was used to develop a model of the impact team learning had on individual performance. Modeling was consistent with the idea that students with similar academic abilities (as determined by tertiary entrance rank) were advantaged (scored higher on individual assessment items) by working in strong teams (teams that scored higher in team-based assessments). Analysis of covariance revealed that students who studied the subject with active learning as the major mode of learning activities outperformed students who studied the subject using the traditional didactic teaching format (lectures and tutorials, P = 0.000). After adjustment for tertiary entrance rank (via analysis of covariance) on two individual tests (the final exam and a late-semester in-class test), individual student grades improved by 8% (95% confidence interval: 6-10%) and 12% (95% confidence interval: 10-14%) when students engaged in team-based active learning. These data quantitatively support the notion that weaker students working in strong teams can overcome their educational disadvantages.

AB In this project, the traditional lecture hall presentation of acid-base physiology in the first-year medical school curriculum was replaced by interactive, computer-assisted instruction designed primarily for the iPad and other mobile computer platforms. Three learning modules were developed, each with similar to 20 screens of information, on the subjects of the CO2-bicarbonate buffer system, other body buffer systems, and acid-base disorders. Five clinical case modules were also developed. For the learning modules, the interactive, active learning activities were primarily step-by-step learner control of explanations of complex physiological concepts, usually presented graphically. For the clinical cases, the active learning activities were primarily question-and-answer exercises that related clinical findings to the relevant basic science concepts. The student response was remarkably positive, with the interactive, active learning aspect of the instruction cited as the most important feature. Also, students cited the self-paced instruction, extensive use of interactive graphics, and side-by-side presentation of text and graphics as positive features. Most students reported that it took less time to study the subject matter with this online instruction compared with subject matter presented in the lecture hall. However, the approach to learning was highly examination driven, with most students delaying the study of the subject matter until a few days before the scheduled examination. Wider implementation of active learning computer-assisted instruction will require that instructors present subject matter interactively, that students fully embrace the responsibilities of independent learning, and that institutional administrations measure instructional effort by criteria other than scheduled hours of instruction.

AB To address a common problem of teaching the sliding filament theory (that is, students have difficulty in visualizing how the component proteins of the sarcomere differ, how they organize themselves into a single working unit, and how they function in relation to each other), we have devised a simple model, with inexpensive materials, to be built by students in the fourth year of an undergraduate biology course. This model can be quickly built by the students themselves and is functional enough to allow visualization of the filaments and their properties. The model uses cheap, simple materials, mostly party and craft supplies, to simulate the component proteins of the sarcomere, and the proposed materials can be readily replaced by more available ones.

AB Qureshi A, Cozine C, Rizvi F. Combination of didactic lectures and review sessions in endocrinology leads to improvement in student performance as measured by assessments. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 89-92, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00068.2012.-There can be no single best way of learning, and each teaching mode has its own merits and demerits. Didactic lectures in and of themselves are insufficient, whereas a problem-based tutorial alone can be as ineffective. This study was conducted to determine if a problem-based review after didactic lectures would lead to better student performance. To compare performance, the same student group was taught three units of endocrinology (growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and diabetes). Students were divided into the following three groups: diabetes didactic lectures only, growth hormone didactic lectures plus review, and thyroid hormone didactic lectures plus review. All three topics were covered in the didactic lectures, but only growth hormone and thyroid hormone topics were covered in the review session. At the end of the course, all students were given formative assessments in the form of multiple-choice questions. A highly significant increase (P < 0.000) in the percentage of correct responses on the questions covering growth hormone (mean: 0.838, SD: 0.158) and thyroid hormone (mean: 0.686, SD: 0.232) compared with diabetes (mean: 0.478, SD: 0.259) was observed. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that the combination of didactic lectures and an active review session leads to an improvement in student performance.

AB Henige K. Use of concept mapping in an undergraduate introductory exercise physiology course. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 197-206, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00001.2012.-Physiology is often considered a challenging course for students. It is up to teachers to structure courses and create learning opportunities that will increase the chance of student success. In an undergraduate exercise physiology course, concept maps are assigned to help students actively process and organize information into manageable and meaningful chunks and to teach them to recognize the patterns and regularities of physiology. Students are first introduced to concept mapping with a commonly relatable nonphysiology concept and are then assigned a series of maps that become more and more complex. Students map the acute response to a drop in blood pressure, the causes of the acute increase in stroke volume during cardiorespiratory exercise, and the factors contributing to an increase in maximal O-2 consumption with cardiorespiratory endurance training. In the process, students draw the integrative nature of physiology, identify causal relationships, and learn about general models and core principles of physiology.

AB Motz BA, James KH, Busey TA. The Lateralizer: a tool for students to explore the divided brain. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 220-225, 2012; doi: 10.1152/advan.00060.2012.-Despite a profusion of popular misinformation about the left brain and right brain, there are functional differences between the left and right cerebral hemispheres in humans. Evidence from split-brain patients, individuals with unilateral brain damage, and neuroimaging studies suggest that each hemisphere may be specialized for certain cognitive processes. One way to easily explore these hemispheric asymmetries is with the divided visual field technique, where visual stimuli are presented on either the left or right side of the visual field and task performance is compared between these two conditions; any behavioral differences between the left and right visual fields may be interpreted as evidence for functional asymmetries between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. We developed a simple software package that implements the divided visual field technique, called the Lateralizer, and introduced this experimental approach as a problem-based learning module in a lower-division research methods course. Second-year undergraduate students used the Lateralizer to experimentally challenge and explore theories of the differences between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Measured learning outcomes after active exploration with the Lateralizer, including new knowledge of brain anatomy and connectivity, were on par with those observed in an upper-division lecture course. Moreover, the project added to the students' research skill sets and seemed to foster an appreciation of the link between brain anatomy and function.

Despite the promise of VPs as an easily accessible and moldable platform, their widespread acceptance and integration into medical curricula have been slow. Here, the authors review the technological underpinnings of VPs, summarize the literature regarding the use and limitations of VPs in the healthcare curriculum, describe novel possible applications of the technology, and propose possible directions for future work.

AB Cendan JC, Johnson TR. Enhancing learning through optimal sequencing of web-based and manikin simulators to teach shock physiology in the medical curriculum. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 402407, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00061.2011.-The Association of American Medical Colleges has encouraged educators to investigate proper linkage of simulation experiences with medical curricula. The authors aimed to determine if student knowledge and satisfaction differ between participation in web-based and manikin simulations for learning shock physiology and treatment and to determine if a specific training sequencing had a differential effect on learning. All 40 second-year medical students participated in a randomized, counterbalanced study with two interventions: group 1 (n = 20) participated in a web-based simulation followed by a manikin simulation and group 2 (n = 20) participated in reverse order. Knowledge and attitudes were documented. Mixed-model ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of time (F(1,38) = 18.6, P = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.33). Group 1 scored significantly higher on quiz 2 (81.5%) than on quiz 1 (74.3%, t(19) = 3.9, P = 0.001), for an observed difference of 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 3.3, 11.0). Mean quiz scores of group 2 did not differ significantly (quiz 1: 77.0% and quiz 2: 79.7%). There was no significant main effect of group or a group by time interaction effect. Students rated the simulations as equally effective in teaching shock physiology (P = 0.88); however, the manikin simulation was regarded as more effective in teaching shock treatment (P = 0.001). Most students (73.7%) preferred the manikin simulation. The two simulations may be of similar efficacy for educating students on the physiology of shock; however, the data suggest improved learning when web-based simulation precedes manikin use. This finding warrants further study.

AB Cortright RN, Lujan HL, Cox JH, DiCarlo SE. Does sex (female versus male) influence the impact of class attendance on examination performance? Adv Physiol Educ 35: 416-420, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00021.2011.-The "conventional wisdom" is that grades are related to class attendance, i.e., students who attend classes more frequently obtain better grades and class attendance dramatically contributes to enhanced learning. However, the influence of sex (female vs. male) on this relationship is understudied. Furthermore, there have been several studies examining the impact of attendance on course grades that challenge the conventional wisdom. To address these issues, we determined the effect of class attendance on examination scores for female and male students enrolled in our undergraduate exercise physiology class of 51 students (20 female students and 31 male students). The experiment was designed not to interfere with the normal conduct of the course. Attendance was recorded in each class, and, although regular attendance was encouraged, it was not required and did not factor into the final grades. The final grade reflected the average days of attendance for female students only. Specifically, female students earning a grade above the class average attended 89 +/- 4% of the classes; however, female students earning a grade below the class average attended only 64 +/- 6% of the classes. In sharp contrast, there was no difference in the number of classes attended for male students earning grades above or below the class average (84 +/- 3% vs. 79 +/- 5%). Accordingly, some male students were absent frequently but scored above the class average, whereas other male students attended many classes but scored below the class average. Thus, the influence of regular attendance on examination performance is more important for female students than male students.

AB Henriksen EJ, Atwater AE, Delamere NA, Dantzler WH. The Physiology undergraduate major in the University of Arizona College of Medicine: past, present, and future. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 103-109, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00089.2010.-The American Physiological Society (APS) and APS Council encourage the teaching of physiology at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical school levels to support the continued prominence of this area of science. One area identified by the APS Council that is of particular importance for the development of future physiologists (the "physiology pipeline") is the teaching of physiology and physiology-related topics at the undergraduate level. In this article, we describe the historical development and implementation of an undergraduate program offered through the Department of Physiology, a basic science department in the College of Medicine at the University of Arizona, culminating in a Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences degree with a major in Physiology. Moreover, we discuss the current Physiology curriculum offered at our institution and explain how this program prepares our students for successful entry into a variety of postbaccalaureate professional programs, including medical school and numerous other programs in health professions, and in graduate study in the Masters and Doctoral programs in biomedical sciences. Finally, we cover the considerable challenges that we have faced, and continue to face, in developing and sustaining a successful physiology undergraduate major in a college of medicine. We hope that the information provided on the Physiology major offered by the Department of Physiology in the College of Medicine at the University of Arizona will be helpful for individuals at other institutions who may be contemplating the development and implementation of an undergraduate program in Physiology.

AB Goodman BE. Insights into digestion and absorption of major nutrients in humans. Adv Physiol Educ 34:44-53, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00094.2009.-Nutrient digestion and absorption is necessary for the survival of living organisms and has evolved into the complex and specific task of the gastrointestinal (GI) system. While most people simply assume that their GI tract will work properly to use nutrients, provide energy, and release wastes, few nonscientists know the details about how various nutrients are digested and how the breakdown products traverse the cells lining the small intestine to reach the blood stream and to be used by the other cells of the body. There have been several recent discoveries of new transporters that likely contribute to the absorption of oligopeptides and fatty acids. In addition, details are being clarified about how transporters work and in what forms nutrients can be absorbed. The enzymes that digest basic carbohydrates, proteins, and fats have been identified in various segments of the GI tract, and details are becoming clearer about what types of bonds they hydrolyze. Usually, detailed information about the digestion of basic nutrients is presented and learned in biochemistry courses and detailed information about absorption via transepithelial transport of the breakdown products of digestion is studied in physiology courses. The goal of this Staying Current article is to combine the details of the biochemistry of digestion with the updated information about the physiology of nutrient absorption into one source for teachers of physiology. Insights are included about some of the diseases and conditions that can bring about malabsorption of food in the GI tract and their consequences.

AB Kommalage M, Imbulgoda N. Introduction of student- led physiology tutorial classes to a traditional curriculum. Adv Physiol Educ 34:65-69, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00010.2010.-The curriculum in the University of Ruhuna Medical School is of the traditional type. Most teaching activities are faculty member-led activities. Since student-centered learning processes are considered to improve certain skills and attitudes, we introduced student- led group classes (SGCs) in physiology. Depending on the outcome of the SGCs, we planned to develop it further. We designed this study to compare student perceptions on newly introduced SGCs with traditional tutorials (TTs). Student perceptions were assessed using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method. Students recognized and appreciated some favorable features of the SGC, such as the opportunity for discussion, quality of the knowledge, active participation, improvement of presentation ability, and increased breadth of knowledge. However, the majority of students preferred the TT over the SGC despite the highlighted benefits of the SGC. Students appreciated the focused learning for examinations, written preparation, and more tutor involvement in the TT. Students requested a hybrid of the TT and SGC by incorporating mandatory written answers to the SGC with greater contributions from faculty members. Assessment methods that were not aligned with the SGC and ingrained passive didactic teaching-learning methods by students and faculty members had a negative effect on the implementation of SGCs. Cultural and economical factors also contributed adversely. In the second step of this Plan-DoCheck- Act process, we are planning to introduce new formative assessment to assess higher-order cognitive skills and a compulsory tutor training program. Some favorable components from the TT will be incorporated to the SGC.

AB Zimmermann M, Eckert GP. Enhanced student experience: an analysis of subjective evaluation and objective learning success after the transformation of a pharmaceutical physiology course. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 1-10, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00091.2009.-In the present article, the reorientation of a fourth-semester physiology course for pharmacy students is described. The motivation for the introduction of changes was to prepare the students to not only assimilate facts but to learn and understand how to integrate and apply them. The article considers how this reorganization was received by the students in both subjective and objective terms. Specifically, we investigate whether our changes resulted in both an enhanced learning experience and improved learning success. The following changes were introduced to the course: first, we integrated either experimental, computer-based teaching modules or case studies in five of the eight course units to give the students the opportunity to gain more hands-on experience; second, we organized regular meetings to enhance communication among the course tutors; and finally, we increased the pass mark for the entrance exam to the course from 50% to 60%. Student opinion was evaluated by means of a questionnaire that was distributed at the end of each course semester throughout the three-semester evaluation period (summer 2008, winter 2008/2009, and summer 2009). The students gave convincing positive feedback concerning the efficacy of the changes in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Moreover, their learning success improved significantly in objective terms as evidenced by enhanced final and State exam performance.

ID CORE PRINCIPLES
AB Application-of-knowledge skills are highly valued in clinical medicine, as indicated by recent changes to licensure and entrance exams for nursing and physician programs (i.e., the NCLEX and MCAT). Such emphasis should be both welcomed and supported by approaches to teaching human anatomy and physiology that emphasize critical thinking skills built upon logic, reasoning, and judgment. The argument for development of these skills is not simply philosophical. Rather, such emphasis is strongly supported by a 2016 Johns Hopkins study (Makary MA, Daniel M. BMJ 353: i2139, 2016) that estimates that medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in the United States! Active learning techniques known to require critical thinking skills are often supplemental to standard expository lecturing or other avenues of imparting content knowledge (reading, videos, etc.). We propose that all content dissemination can and should provide for the development of critical thinking skills, preparing students for active learning techniques requiring this ability. This can be accomplished by establishing an intellectual framework for understanding the adaptive benefits of anatomical or physiological traits. Additionally, explanations conveying the causality of mechanistic sequences result in learning content within intuitive functional groups rather than as isolated phenomena, the latter often accomplished mainly through memorization as opposed to real understanding. Here, we provide a template for lecture development based upon these principles as well as a specific example from human anatomy and physiology. Our hope is to provide a model for how students should think about all physiology, making comprehensive coverage of content (an impossible task!) much less important.

AB Undergraduate kinesiology students oversaw exercise testing and 4 wk of supervised exercise for community volunteers. Both students and their community participants reported enjoying the experience, and students stated that it also improved their understanding and confidence. These results suggest that student-led personal training programs provide meaningful benefits to students and their community volunteers.
   Service learning opportunities allow students to apply their knowledge and skills through engagement with their community. Previous studies have suggested that student-led exercise testing and health screening can benefit both students and their community participants. In a third-year kinesiology course, "Physiological Assessment and Training," students at the University of Prince Edward Island are provided with an introduction to health-focused personal training and develop and manage personalized training programs for community volunteers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of student-led training programs on student learning. A secondary purpose was to investigate the perceptions of community members participating in the program. Community participants included 13 men and 43 women with stable health (mean age: 52.3 & PLUSMN; 10.0 yr). Students led participants through aerobic and musculoskeletal fitness tests before and after completion of a 4-wk student-designed training program based on participants' fitness and interests. Students reported that the program was enjoyable and improved understanding of fitness concepts and confidence in personal training. Community participants rated the programs as enjoyable and appropriate and viewed students as professional and knowledgeable. These results suggest that student-led personal training programs provide meaningful benefits to students and their community volunteers.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Undergraduate kinesiology students oversaw exercise testing and 4 wk of supervised exercise for community volunteers.

AB Previously, we described a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for first-year students that featured a unique approach to brain mapping in a model organism (rat). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted this course for an online learning environment, emphasizing image analysis (identifying immunoreactive signal in an immunohistochemical stain, making neuroanatomical distinctions in a cytoarchitectural stain) and translation of image data to the brain atlas. Using a quasiexperimental mixed methods approach, we evaluated aspects of student engagement and perceived gains in student confidence with respect to the nature and process of science and student science identity development. Additionally, we examined the dynamics of mentorship and student connectedness experienced in the online-only context. We found that the majority of students reported positive affective outcomes for the course in domains such as project ownership and project engagement in addition to positive responses toward perceived mentorship received during the course. Unsurprisingly, students expressed frustration in not being able to freely communicate with members of the course in an organic face-to-face environment. Furthermore, we found that students encountered greater difficulty in mastering image software skills causing a delay in producing consistentquality data maps. From our analysis of the course, we have identified both useful approaches and areas for course improvement in any future iterations of the online research course.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Herein, we describe the process of converting a novel, face-to-face neuroanatomy course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) to an online-only research setting. We document student affective and skill gains resultant from participating in this course and examine best practices for structuring online CUREs to maximize student learning and success.

AB There is increasing awareness of the importance of civic engagement in higher education. Service-learning activities in undergraduate programs, in particular, have been linked to positive academic outcomes and gains in various forms of self-efficacy. Exercise Science students at our university complete two service-learning courses as part of the curriculum, each of which involves implementing a structured 12-week individualized fitness training program with a community member client. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of these service-learning experiences on Exercise Science students' self-efficacy for fitness assessment and exercise prescription. Students completed a seven-item self-efficacy questionnaire administered at both the beginning and end of each service-learning course and reflected on their experience using an end-of-course survey. Our results showed significant improvements in self-efficacy from pretest to posttest for each of the two service-learning experiences, with the second experience producing additional gains in self-efficacy over and above the first. Students also reported improved confidence in their fitness assessment and exercise prescription skills in the end-of-course survey. Community members involved in the fitness training program reported a positive experience with students' knowledge of fitness assessment and exercise prescription as well as their own progression to independence in a home exercise program. Our findings highlight the benefits of including a structured service-learning experience in the Exercise Science curriculum.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study was done to investigate the effect of a structured fitness training experience on Exercise Science students' self-efficacy for fitness assessment and exercise prescription.

AB Humanization of donors in gross anatomy courses has been reported to facilitate professional behavior in healthcare students. However, there is a lack of research investigating whether students' knowledge of donor information is associated with humanization of whole body donors. To address this gap, the present study aimed to 1) determine whether knowledge of donor information is associated with greater humanization of donors and 2) investigate student perceptions of receiving donor information. Donor information was provided to students at the beginning of the course (cohort A) or at midsemester (cohort B). Questionnaires utilized quantitative and qualitative methods to assess humanization and student perceptions at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Independent t tests demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in mean humanization scores between cohorts A and B before the first dissection [t(37) = 0.449, P = 0.656], at midsemester [t(35) = -1.546, P = 0.131], or at the end of the semester [t(28) = 0.004, P = 0.997]. Thematic analysis demonstrated that as the semester progressed students' view of dissection as an invasion of privacy and the donor as a patient decreased. Themes delineated from students' open-ended responses revealed that students felt a connection with their donors; that the donors' consenting information gave permission to dissect; and that the information gave students an invaluable learning experience. Students demonstrated detached concern toward their donor, viewing the donor as a learning tool or educator rather than a patient. However, their responses also indicated the development of a deeper, personal connection to donors.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY A look at the use of donor personal statements and information to humanize donors and how it influenced students' experiences in a gross anatomy laboratory.

TI A student-centered seminar course as a complementary approach to a

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE graduate seminar; student centered
ID PHYSIOLOGY
AB Graduate physiology programs strive to provide students with in-depth expertise in a particular academic discipline, often facilitating this process in the form of a departmental seminar course. Within the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of California Irvine (UCI), students are required to attend a seminar course, most often designed as a journal club, each quarter until they are ready to graduate. While this format may work well in departments where research topics are closely related, it has historically been less successful in UCI's Department of Physiology and Biophysics, where wide-ranging interests make for little overlap in foundational knowledge, limiting meaningful engagement with the material or with peers in the class. In this paper, we describe a complementary approach of developing a syllabus around student interests and covering topics that are critical for student success but often omitted from graduate curricula, such as interview skills, grant writing, and scientific communication. Results from our preclass survey motivated this approach to the class, and our retrospective survey demonstrated the substantial differences in student engagement, enthusiasm, and perceived benefits of this course relative to the journal club style course. We hope that the success of our course may serve as an exemplar for strategies to engage students more effectively and provide critical training in diverse skillsets that will help students after graduation.

AB This article captures a collective reflection on the successes and challenges we experienced when teaching physiology laboratories online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physiology instructors from six institutions discussed their own efforts to redesign meaningful physiology laboratories that could be taught remotely, as the nation scrambled to respond to the sudden shift out of the classroom. Despite the complexity of this task, clear themes emerged as our courses transitioned to an online format in spring 2020 and were solidified in the fall of 2020. This article reflects on the history, features, benefits, and challenges of current laboratory teaching when applying a scientific teaching approach to facilitate the redesign process. We believe online networks like ours can facilitate information sharing, promote innovations, and provide support for instructors. The insights we gained through this collaboration will influence our thinking about the future of the physiology lab, whether online or in person.

AB Understanding the gross organization of skeletal muscle is critical to understanding the mechanism of action of muscle physiology. Due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), many colleges have had to discontinue or curtail teaching and laboratory activities. Whether students are in the classroom or learning online, it is important for them to understand the basics of skeletal muscle organization that allows for movement. Manipulatives have been shown to enhance student learning and understanding in many fields, including physiology. This gives instructors an easy-to-follow tool for making a manipulative that allows students to see the organization of the skeletal muscle. Students can make this manipulative themselves from supplies commonly found in the home or office.

ID SUPERRESOLUTION
AB The rise of microscopy in the seventeenth century allowed scientists to discover a new world of microorganisms and achieve great physiological advances. One of the first microscopes of the epoch was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's microscope, a deceptively simple device that contains a single ball lens housed in a metal plate allowing the observation of samples at up to x250 magnification. Such magnification was much greater than that achieved by rudimentary compound microscopes of the era, allowing for the discovery of microscopic, single-celled life, an achievement that marked the study of biology up to the nineteenth century. Since Leeuwenhoek's design uses a single ball lens, it is possible to fabricate variations for educational activities in physics and biology university and high school classrooms. A fundamental problem, however, with home-built microscopes is that it is difficult to work with glass. We developed a simple protocol to make ball lenses of glass and gelatin with high magnification that can be done in a university/high school classroom, and we designed an optimized support for focusing and taking photographs with a smartphone. The protocol details a simple, easily accessible, low-cost, and effective tool for the observation of microscopic samples, possible to perform anywhere without the need for a laboratory or complex tools. Our protocol has been implemented in classrooms in Chile to a favorable reception.

AB Engaging undergraduate students in large classes is a constant challenge for many lecturers, as student participation and engagement can be limited. This is a concern since there is a positive correlation between increased engagement and student success. The lack of student feedback on content delivery prevents lecturers from identifying topics that would benefit students if reviewed. Implementing novel methods to engage the students in course content and create ways by which they can inform the lecturer of the difficult concepts is needed to increase student success. In the present study, we investigated the use of Twitter as a scalable approach to enhance engagement with course content and peer-to-peer interaction in a large course. In this pilot study, students were instructed to tweet the difficult concepts identified from content delivered by videos. A software program automatically collected and parsed the tweets to extract summary statistics on the most common difficult concepts, and the lecturer used the information to prepare face-to-face (F2F) lectorial sessions. The key findings of the study were 1) the uptake of Twitter (i.e., registration on the platform) was similar to the proportion of students who participated in F2F lectorials, 2) students reviewed content soon after delivery to tweet difficult concepts to lecturer, 3) Twitter increased engagement with lecturers, 4) the difficult concepts were similar to previous years, yet the automated gathering of Twitter data was more efficient and time saving for the lecturer, and 5) students found the lectorial review sessions very valuable.

AB The objective of this study was to determine gastrointestinal transit time in first-year health science students with a laboratory practical exercise conducted in two cohorts (classes of 2018 and 2019) of first-year health sciences students at the Health Science Campus in Windhoek, Namibia. All first-year health science students undertaking the Physiology course were invited to take part in the laboratory exercise. The primary outcome was the measurement of gastrointestinal transit time from the amount of time taken for ingested whole-kernel sweetcorn to be eliminated, which was calculated as the time period between ingestion of corn and the time of corn first seen in the stool and the time corn was last seen in the stool. The secondary outcome was an association between emotional irritability and/or anxiety and gastrointestinal transit time. The study analyzed responses of 175 students, who reported a median transit time of 29 (1-99) h. There was no difference in gastrointestinal transit time between male and female students. Likewise, there was no difference in the duration of the corn in the bowel between male and female students. Students who reported being worried and irritable during the exercise had more bowel movements before they saw corn in their stool and had slower transit times, respectively. A wider range of transit time was reported in a group of young, healthy students compared with previous studies in the literature. There were no differences between male and female student bowel activity. Anxiety did impact the bowel activity of the participants.

   professional skills; transferable skills
AB Changing labor markets require a workforce that is broadly trained for a variety of possible careers. Recognizing this, government and industry representatives, along with students and their families, are encouraging universities and colleges to focus more on developing transferable skills to maximize employability of their graduates. In response, academic institutions and professional organizations have begun to develop lists of transferable professional skills that they expect students to have acquired on graduation. At the 2018 Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG) meeting, participants stated that there was a need to define a list of professional skills for undergraduates completing a physiology major. To this end, a professional skills committee was established. Initially members of the committee worked together to develop a draft list of skills. An iterative process of refining the list was then undertaken through presentations/small-group discussions at appropriate international meetings and via an online survey. Over 60 physiology educators, the majority of whom teach in undergraduate programs, provided input. The final list (presented here) consists of 13 skills grouped in four broad categories: think critically, communicate effectively, behave in a socially and scientifically responsible manner, and demonstrate laboratory proficiency. It is anticipated that the list will be used for curriculum mapping and to guide the development of new physiology courses and major programs. The professional skills committee now plans to develop rubrics and tools that will allow for the assessment of these skills.

AB Traditional oral examination (TOE) is criticized for the shortage of objectivity, standardization, and reliability. These perceived limitations can be mitigated by the introduction of structured oral examination (SOE). There is little evidence of the implementation of SOE in physiology laboratory courses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SOE in laboratory-based learning sessions. Second-year medical students (n = 114) attended a 16-wk physiology laboratory course. They were initially assessed by TOE in the middle of the academic term. The students' perspectives on this assessment were measured by a modified three-point Likert-type scale questionnaire. Following this, faculty members prepared topics for SOE; nine topics were included from each laboratory course. The correct answers and scoring criteria were discussed among the faculty before the SOE event. One week after the last laboratory course, SOE was carried out for each student. As with the TOE process, student feedback was collected via a modified three-point Likert-type scale questionnaire. The mean laboratory homework score from the first four and last four laboratory courses was also calculated. Paper exams were also conducted after TOE and SOE. The results show that SOE is more acceptable to students than TOE. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in terms of uniformity of questions asked, syllabus coverage, and anxiety levels. In addition, SOE improved students' performance in the laboratory course explored here. We contend that SOE shows promise as an effective assessment tool in laboratory-based physiology learning sessions.

AB Generating an increasingly skilled and numerous workforces of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals is a national priority. Central to this goal is improving the ability of STEM graduates to apply scientific inquiry within oral communication, a necessary skill for STEM professionals. In this case study of an introductory biology course, we observed that providing explanatory feedback to students responding to inquiry-based questions in an oral examination suggests improvements in students' abilities to critically analyze results, draw conclusions, and discuss the broader implications of data. We found students struggled with generating hypotheses and constraining discussions of scientific limitation and broader implications. We show that low-performing students especially benefit from the feedback intervention. The findings of this study are applicable to college and university instructors who are looking to incorporate methods for teaching students to use scientific inquiry effectively during oral communication, particularly those with access to teaching assistants.

AB Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBI, on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map. and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology. were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning. analytic, and problem-solving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures.

AB An accurate self-assessment of student work can enhance student learning and subsequently improve academic performance. Instructors can facilitate this process by providing "standards" that students can utilize as feedback when self-evaluating their understanding. Traditional forms of feedback, such as marked assessment tasks, are limited in their ability to serve as standards, as they do not adequately capture variations corresponding to different levels of understanding. To develop a complex understanding in physiology, students have to integrate concepts pertaining to different subcomponents of body systems. The present study attempted to ascertain if exposing students to variations in complexity would refine their ability to self-evaluate their understanding and capacity to integrate concepts. Students were tasked to answer an essay-length. open-ended physiology question to expose their current understanding of the topic. The change in students' self-marking of their answer before and after being exposed to the variations in conceptual understanding of the topic were used to determine whether improvements in self-evaluation accuracy occurred. These variations were presented as instructor-generated answers to the open-ended question, framed using the structure of the observed learning outcome (SOLO) taxonomy. Student scores in the integrative questions of the end-of-semester exam were used as a measure of student ability to integrate concepts. Findings indicated that this intervention led to improvements in student self-evaluation and exam performance. and the positive outcomes were replicated across multiple iterations of the activity.

AB Basic life support (BLS) knowledge is a necessity for nursing students, as they have to deal with cardiac arrest events during their professional career. Existing studies indicate poor BLS knowledge among health science students, including nursing students. Learning BLS requires an understanding of basic sciences, such as anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry, subjects perceived to be difficult, resulting in misconceptions. Hence, a multimedia-aided instruction on BLS, supplemented with cooperating learning groups. was developed to assist nursing students in gaining correct BLS knowledge. A pretest-posttest designed for single cooperating groups was employed to evaluate students' achievements. Sixty-five undergraduate nursing students took the pretest and posttest that consisted of 10 open-ended questions, each designed to evaluate an aspect of their BLS knowledge. The results show significantly more students (60 vs. 20%) answered more questions correctly on the posttest compared with the pretest (P value <0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Thus the multimedia-aided instruction package enhanced undergraduate nursing students' understanding of BLS and also assisted to generate a positive perception of multimedia-aided instructions, supplemented with a cooperating learning group.

AB The National License Examination step 1 (NLE1), which tests basic medical sciences knowledge in Thailand. is considered to be tough and stressful for medical students due to the large amount of content. This study aimed to determine factors influencing the NLE1 score (NLE1S). The NLE1S, academic achievement, and class attendance were obtained officially. Other factors, including study habits, were obtained via a questionnaire, with 81.97% (241/294) being returned. Students were divided into four groups according to the central passing score and Z-score of the NLE1S, including the fail (<52%; n = 13). low-pass (52 to <70%; n = 121), high-pass (70 to <80%; n = 89). and excellent (>= 80%; n = 18) groups. Men had higher NLE1S (P < 0.001) and comprehensive examination scores (P < 0.001) than women. Students with high motivation to study medicine had higher NLE1S. Daily preparation time (h/day) was lower, but stress was higher, in the fail group. In the excellent group, internet for academic use and achievement of study targets were higher; internet for nonacademic use, instance of absence, and stress were lower; and check-in time was earlier. The NLE1S had strong positive correlations with the comprehensive examination score and academic achievement during preclinical studies. By setting the NLE1S as a dependent variable in multivariate regression analyses, models of significant interactions were observed by setting behavioral factors, the comprehensive examination score, and academic achievement during a regular class as independent variables. Thus exhibiting good study habits and showing good academic performance throughout preclinical studies should be encouraged among students to achieve a good NLE1S.

AB Scientific advocacy and outreach programs are encouraged to increase public understanding of scientific knowledge and generate interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. However, evaluation of these events' effectiveness is difficult and somewhat rare. This study's purpose was to better understand how effective an established physiology-based outreach program was in generating interest in STEM careers, while simultaneously providing information that can be used to increase the effectiveness of future events. We partnered with a private school located in Omaha, Nebraska, where 64-80 students participated in 3 h of physiology-based activities presented by volunteers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The event included a brief presentation of the eye, sensory, heart, and lung systems, followed by hands-on demonstrations and activities. Each session concluded with 15 min of questions and answers (Q&A), where students were encouraged to engage the volunteers in inquiries about what they just learned, career-related questions, or any topic of their choosing. Each Q&A session was audio recorded and evaluated using thematic analysis to identify patterns in the Q&A data. Two major themes of questions were identified: 1) scientific content (animal circulatory systems and how organs are affected by disease or stimulus); and 2) career-related content, including typical day-to-day activities of a scientist and the volunteers' satisfaction with a scientific career. We conclude that hands-on physiology-based learning opportunities are effective in generating short-term interest in STEM content and careers. The results of this study will also facilitate informed modification of event content to better suit student's interests.

AB Over recent decades, education has increasingly focused on student-centered learning. Guided practices represent a new way of learning for undergraduate students of physiology, whereby the students turn into teacher-students and become more deeply involved in the subject by preparing and teaching a practical (laboratory) class to their peers. The goal was to assess the students' opinions about guided practices and how physiological parameters change during the activity. For this objective, two experiments were performed. First, a voluntary questionnaire on guided practices was completed by the students during 2 academic years. Students could also write a free text commentary. The positive answers obtained in the questionnaire and the free commentary responses point to the effectiveness of this methodology in students' minds. Negative aspects included the time spent preparing the activity, and the stress that students experienced in the teaching role. Second, information about how the teacher-students felt before teaching the practical class was self-reported, and physiological parameters related to stress (heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and electrocardiogram recorded to evaluate R-R interval and heart rate variability) were measured immediately before and while the practical class was taught. This evaluation reported an increase in stress during the execution of the practice. In conclusion, despite a new and stressful situation, guided practices are of interest for the students as a learning tool and for the acquisition of skills that may be of use in their later professional lives.

AB A positive correlation between performance and participation in formative quizzes and final summative examinations has been reported many times. The goal of the present interview study was to construct a model to explain why students may elect not to engage with formative assessment opportunities. Our medical school's preclinical curriculum has an established policy of offering weekly online quizzes in all courses during the first 2 yr. Quizzes do not count for credit. Semistructured interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and a formal thematic analysis was applied. A total of 16 in-depth interviews were conducted, with 8 female and 8 male participants. Thematic analysis revealed four major interacting themes that we propose to converge to account for nonparticipation in quizzes: 1) inadequate feedback, 2) curriculum organization and student mistrust, 3) time constraints, and 4) fear of judgment. We propose seven practice points to improve the effectiveness of formative assessment quizzes of medical knowledge.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE overall reaction of ureogenesis; overall reaction of gluconeogenesis;
   interaction between ureogenesis and gluconeogenesis; importance of
   balanced equations
AB It is well known that a strong metabolic interrelationship exists between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. In this paper, we present a detailed, overall equation, describing a possible metabolic link between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. We adopted a guided approach in which we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall equation of a metabolic pathway, carefully account for all atoms and charges of the single reactions, as well as the cellular localizations of the substrates, and the related transport systems. If this suggestion is always taken into account, a balanced, overall equation of a metabolic pathway will be obtained, which strongly facilitates the discussion of its physio-logical role. Unfortunately, textbooks often report unbalanced overall equations of metabolic pathways, including ureagenesis and gluco-neogenesis. Most likely the reason is that metabolism and enzymology have been neglected for about three decades, owing to the remarkable advances of molecular biology and molecular genetics. In this paper, we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall reaction of a metabolic pathway, carefully control if the single reactions are properly balanced for atoms and charges. Following this suggestion, we were able to obtain an overall equation describing the metabolic interrelationship between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis, in which urea and glucose are the final products. The aim is to better rationalize this topic and to convince students and teachers that metabolism is an important and rewarding chapter of human physiology.

AB The study and teaching of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology necessitates an understanding of the cellular basis of contractile and electrical coupling behaviors in the muscle layers that comprise the gut wall. Our knowledge of the cellular origin of GI motility has drastically changed over the last 100 yr. While the pacing and coordination of GI contraction was once thought to be solely attributable to smooth muscle cells, it is now widely accepted that the motility patterns observed in the GI tract exist as a result of a multicellular system, consisting of not only smooth muscle cells but also enteric neurons and distinct populations of specialized interstitial cells that all work in concert to ensure proper GI functions. In this historical perspective, we focus on the emerging role of interstitial cells in GI motility and examine the key discoveries and experiments that led to a major shift in a paradigm of GI physiology regarding the role of interstitial cells in modulating GI contractile patterns. A review of these now classic experiments and papers will enable students and educators to fully appreciate the complex, multicellular nature of GI muscles as well as impart lessons on how shifting paradigms in physiology are fueled by new technologies that lead to new emerging discoveries.

AB This article describes student perceptions and outcomes in relation to the use of a novel inter-teaching approach. The study sample (n = 260) was taken from a large human physiology class, which included both first-and second-year students. However, unlike the first-year students, the second-year students had significant prior knowledge, having completed a previous physiology course. Active learning, where students were required to engage with course material in a self-directed manner before tutorials and to identify areas of difficulty and discuss these within tutorial sessions, was a central component of the study. The second-year students adapted quickly to the novel approach, as indicated by stable levels of perceived difficulty and understanding. In contrast, the first-year students demonstrated a decrease in perceived difficulty and an increase in perceived individual understanding throughout the study. These results not-withstanding, there was a consistent low level of interest for both years but no significant difference between the first-and second-year individual and group learning skills by the end of the study, as measured by their performance in the tutorials. Overall, the results were encouraging, with both years achieving a reasonably high learning skill level (average: similar to 70%) within the interteaching environment. The improvement of active learning shown by the first-year students may have compensated, to some extent, for the prior learning advantage of the second-year students, since both groups achieved similar marks in the written components of final exams for both interteaching modules.

AB Multiple-choice questions are a gold-standard tool in medical school for assessment of knowledge and are the mainstay of licensing examinations. However, multiple-choice questions items can be criticized for lacking the ability to test higher-order learning or integrative thinking across multiple disciplines. Our objective was to develop a novel assessment that would address understanding of pathophysiology and pharmacology, evaluate learning at the levels of application, evaluation and synthesis, and allow students to demonstrate clinical reasoning. The rubric assesses student writeups of clinical case problems. The method is based on the physician's traditional postencounter Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan note. Students were required to correctly identify subjective and objective findings in authentic clinical case problems, to ascribe pathophysiological as well as pharmacological mechanisms to these findings, and to justify a list of differential diagnoses. A utility analysis was undertaken to evaluate the new assessment tool by appraising its reliability, validity, feasibility, cost effectiveness, acceptability, and educational impact using a mixed-method approach. The Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan assessment tool scored highly in terms of validity and educational impact and had acceptable levels of statistical reliability but was limited in terms of acceptance, feasibility, and cost effectiveness due to high time demands on expert graders and workload concerns from students. We conclude by making suggestions for improving the tool and recommend deployment of the instrument for low-stakes summative assessment or formative assessment.

AB The flipped teaching model can engage students in the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The purpose of the present study was to assess the outcomes of a semiflipped teaching model over time. Neurophysiology students spent the majority of class time listening to traditional didactic lectures, but they also listened to 5 online lectures and spent 8-10 class periods completing an active learning assignment. At the end of the term, students completed a survey to assess the outcomes of the active learning assignments. The positive outcomes were greater the second time the course was taught in a semiflipped manner. While completely flipping a course takes a tremendous amount of time, instructors can still obtain positive outcomes by implementing a semiflipped teaching model.

ID TREATMENT STRATEGIES; BARIATRIC SURGERY; ATTITUDES
AB Awareness of effective weight management strategies is necessary to prepare exercise science students for future work with obesity. Exercise science faculty members developed a course related to exercise as a therapeutic tool and options available for weight loss. The purpose of the present study was to investigate student views of weight management and obesity, which can be a difficult task using traditional methods such as Likert scale surveys. To investigate student views relative to the course content, Q methodology, which is a mixed-method research approach, was used at the beginning and end of the course. Students completed a Q sort, ranking 44 statements related to obesity in accordance to their own points of view. The pretest/posttest design enabled an opportunity to determine if course goals were accomplished and if student perceptions related to obesity were transformed. Factor analysis of precourse sorts revealed that students possessed a naive singular view of weight-related concepts. Analysis of sorts at course completion resulted in a two-factor solution revealing changes in perspective; some students took on a health professional type of view, whereas others demonstrated antifat views. In conclusion, the findings revealed key variables that should be addressed in curricula involving therapeutic obesity interventions. An improved curriculum based on these results should better encourage students to develop a broad comprehension of multifactorial causes and treatment for weight management and obesity. Implementing the use of Q methodology may serve as a valuable asset to measure and evaluate subjectivity of obesity discrimination. Antifat attitudes among exercise science students may influence future clients' potential achievements.

AB This is a reflective essay based on the experience of developing a structure and function module within a new integrated medical curriculum. Our hope is that the insights we gained during a 4-yr journey in a new medical school will be transferable to others engaged with curriculum development. Here, we present an interpretive analysis of our personal experiences together with some original research data and a synthesis of the literature. We will argue that a focus on teaching faculty is the key to successful curriculum integration and suggest an agenda for faculty development. Our essay begins by exploring what curriculum integration really means and what its purpose might be. Our case study explores the challenges of building a shared understanding among stakeholders and of negotiating learning outcomes and methods of teaching as well as the process of developing content and assessment. We feel that many of our experiences in the new medical school are applicable in other settings, such as curriculum reform in established schools and for developers of competency-based premedical curricula. We conclude with recommendations to assist other curriculum planners and teachers by offering some benefits of hindsight.

AB While the first year of medical school is challenging for all students, there may be specific issues for students from rural areas, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, ethnic minorities, or nontraditional age groups. A Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) was created to prepare entering at-risk students for the demands of medical school. For the past 2 yr, an emphasis was placed on the development of appropriate study plans and skills. On presurveys, students predicted an increase in their number of study hours per lecture hour, from 7.6 h in undergraduate coursework to 9.1 h in medical school coursework (n = 35). These study plans were infeasible given the rigorous didactic lecture schedule in medical school. Interventions were made through lectures on study plans and modeling of appropriate study habits using engaging lectures in the SPP physiology course. At the end of the program, a postsurvey was given, and students reported a reduction in the planned hours of study to a more realistic 3.9 h of study time per hour of lecture. Furthermore, students planned to decrease their use of textbooks while increasing their use of concept mapping, videos, and peer teaching. The majority of students completing the SPP program with a study skills emphasis performed well in the Medical Physiology course, with 4 students honoring in the course, 27 students passing, and 2 students remediating the course after an initial failure. These results indicate that at-risk medical students may have inappropriate study plans that can be improved through participation in a program that emphasizes study skills development.

AB Due to growing demand from students and facilitated by innovations in educational technology, institutions of higher learning are increasingly offering online courses. Subjects in the hard sciences, such as pathophysiology, have traditionally been taught in the face-to-face format, but growing demand for preclinical science courses has compelled educators to incorporate online components into their classes to promote comprehension. Learning tools such as case studies are being integrated into such courses to aid in student interaction, engagement, and critical thinking skills. Careful assessment of pedagogical techniques is essential; hence, this study aimed to evaluate and compare student perceptions of the use of case studies in face-to-face and fully online pathophysiology classes. A series of case studies was incorporated into the curriculum of a pathophysiology class for both class modes (online and face to face). At the end of the semester, students filled out a survey assessing the effectiveness of the case studies. Both groups offered positive responses about the incorporation of case studies in the curriculum of the pathophysiology class. This study supports the argument that with proper use of innovative teaching tools, such as case studies, online pathophysiology classes can foster a sense of community and interaction that is typically only seen with face-to-face classes, based on student responses. Students also indicated that regardless of class teaching modality, use of case studies facilitates student learning and comprehension as well as prepares them for their future careers in health fields.

AB Gopalan C, Fox DJ, Gaebelein CJ. Effect of an individual readiness assurance test on a team readiness assurance test in the team-based learning of physiology. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 61-64, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00095.2012.-We examined whether requiring an individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) before a team readiness assurance test (tRAT) would benefit students in becoming better problem solvers in physiology. It was tested in the form of tRAT scores, the time required to complete the tRAT assignment, and individual performance on the unit examinations. Students in one section were given the iRAT at the beginning of the team-based learning session. The same set of questions was given to students as their tRAT immediately after their iRAT. Students in the second section were not given the iRAT before the tRAT. This pattern was reversed for the next scheduled team-based learning activity between the two sections. We found that the section having both the iRAT and tRAT scored higher on the tRAT and completed their assignments in less time than the section with the tRAT alone. This suggests that the tRAT combined with the iRAT is an effective team-based approach to the teaching of physiology compared with the tRAT alone.

AB Hryciw DH, Tangalakis K, Supple B, Best G. Evaluation of a peer mentoring program for a mature cohort of first-year undergraduate paramedic students. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 80-84, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00129.2012.-The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-assisted study session (PASS) program for a large class of Bachelor of Health Science (Paramedic) students. This cohort was made up predominantly of mature aged students who have not undertaken any study for many years. Within a bioscience first-year core subject, student mentees attended PASS sessions on a voluntary basis, with second-year Bachelor of Health Science (Paramedic) students acting as mentors. Mentors were recruited based on their outstanding academic performance in bioscience the previous year and selected based on group and individual interviews. Successful candidates participated in a compulsory 2 days of student mentor training and were supported throughout the program to develop their mentoring skills in both face-to-face workshops and online. Mentee students were allocated to a PASS session with a maximum size of 25 students/group that was facilitated by 2 student mentors. In general, the program was viewed favorably by both mentors and mentees. There was an increase in academic performance and a decrease in the fail rate of the mentee group compared with the cohort of students that did not participate in the PASS program. Importantly, mentees believed that the program improved their study skills and gave them confidence in their approach to studying. This is a significant consideration for the improvement of student transition and retention in a mature aged student cohort.

In this article, we describe the effect of cardiac maneuvers on systolic murmurs and how physiological principles apply to the explanation of the changes noted at the bedside. We discuss the effect of Valsalva, squatting, and hand grip maneuvers on different physiological parameters influencing preload, afterload, chamber dimensions, and pressure gradients. The clinical manifestations noted during the aforementioned maneuvers are described in common cardiac conditions responsible for the production of certain systolic murmurs.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 34-41, 2012; doi: 10.1152/advan.00122.2011.-To systematically investigate whether the inclusion of a bioethical discussion improves the learning and retention of biological content, students in two sections of an introductory zoology class were taught the biology behind emergency contraception and RU-486. Students in one section of the course participated in a bioethical discussion, whereas students in the other section participated in a content-only discussion. Pre- and postsurveys, response paragraphs, and a final exam were collected and used to examine the learning and retention of content knowledge. Results suggested that students who participated in a bioethical discussion of emergency contraception and RU-486 learned and retained information better than students who received contentonly instruction. Interestingly, students who participated in the bioethical discussion also appeared to be more confident in their answers. The results of this study may inform the teaching practices and goals of science educators who would like to incorporate a discussion of bioethical issues into their curriculum but often feel that content coverage is paramount.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 378-383, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00039.2011.-The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interleaving and expanding retrieval on the retention of physiology concepts. Participants (n = 189) read and then reread 30 immunology and reproductive physiology passages. Half of the participants read and then reread the passages in a blocked manner (e.g., a(1)a(2)a(3)b(1)b(2)b(3)), and the other half did so in an interleaved manner (e.g., a(1)b(1)b(2)a(2)a(3)b(3)). Participants were then repeatedly assessed, without feedback, after either a uniform or an expanding series of intervals. Half of the students from both the blocked and interleaved groups completed the assessments 1, 2, and 3 days after rereading the passages (uniform), whereas the other half completed the assessments immediately and 1 and 3 days after rereading the passages (expanding). All participants completed a final assessment 10 days after rereading the passages. There were no significant differences between the blocked and interleaved groups on any of the assessments, nor were there any significant interactions between the groups on any of the assessments. Those in the expanding retrieval group scored significantly higher than those in the uniform group on all four assessments (ANOVA; assessment 1: F = 35.12, P = 0.00; assessment 2: F = 13.88, P = 0.00; assessment 3: F = 10.87, P = 0.00; and assessment 4: F = 6.79, P = 0.01). Mean final assessment scores were 47.58 +/- 19.81 and 40.50 +/- 17.17 for the expanding and uniform groups, respectively. The results indicate that participants benefited more from expanding retrieval practice.

AB FitzPatrick KA, Finn KE, Campisi J. Effect of personal response systems on student perception and academic performance in courses in a health sciences curriculum. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 280-289, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00036.2011.-To increase student engagement, active participation, and performance, personal response systems (clickers) were incorporated into six lecture-based sections of four required courses within the Health Sciences Department major curriculum: freshman-level Anatomy and Physiology I and II, junior-level Exercise Physiology, and senior- level Human Pathophysiology. Clickers were used to gather anonymous student responses to questions posed within the class period after individual thought and peer discussion. Students (n = 293, 88% of students completing the courses) completed a perceptual survey on clicker effectiveness inserted into the Student Assessment of Learning Gains online instrument. Across courses and years, students uniformly rated several dimensions of clicker use as providing good to great gain in engaging them in active learning, increasing participation and involvement during class, maintaining attention, applying material immediately, providing feedback concerning their understanding, and offering an anonymous format for participation. Within these four sections, quiz grades were compared between clicker and nonclicker years. Significant increases in pre- and posttest scores were seen in Exercise Physiology in clicker years and on some, but not all material, in Anatomy and Physiology I and II based on content quizzes. Human Pathophysiology results were unexpected, with higher quiz scores in the nonclicker year. The results support the hypothesis of increased engagement with clicker use. The hypothesis of increased student performance was not consistently supported. Increased performance was seen in Exercise Physiology. In Anatomy and Physiology I and II, performance improved on some content quizzes. In Human Pathophysiology, performance did not improve with clickers.

AB Gurpinar E, Alimoglu MK, Mamakli S, Aktekin M. Can learning style predict student satisfaction with different instruction methods and academic achievement in medical education? Adv Physiol Educ 34: 192-196, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00075.2010.-The curriculum of our medical school has a hybrid structure including both traditional training (lectures) and problem-based learning (PBL) applications. The purpose of this study was to determine the learning styles of our medical students and investigate the relation of learning styles with each of satisfaction with different instruction methods and academic achievement in them. This study was carried out with the participation of 170 first-year medical students (the participation rate was 91.4%). The researchers prepared sociodemographic and satisfaction questionnaires to determine the characteristics of the participants and their satisfaction levels with traditional training and PBL. The Kolb learning styles inventory was used to explore the learning styles of the study group. The participants completed all forms at the end of the first year of medical education. Indicators of academic achievement were scores of five theoretical block exams and five PBL exams performed throughout the academic year of 2008-2009. The majority of the participants took part in the "diverging" (n = 84, 47.7%) and "assimilating" (n = 73, 41.5%) groups. Numbers of students in the "converging" and "accommodating" groups were 11 (6.3%) and 8 (4.5%), respectively. In all learning style groups, PBL satisfaction scores were significantly higher than those of traditional training. Exam scores for "PBL and traditional training" did not differ among the four learning styles. In logistic regression analysis, learning style (assimilating) predicted student satisfaction with traditional training and success in theoretical block exams. Nothing predicted PBL satisfaction and success. This is the first study conducted among medical students evaluating the relation of learning style with student satisfaction and academic achievement. More research with larger groups is needed to generalize our results. Some learning styles may relate to satisfaction with and achievement in some instruction methods.

AB In exercise physiology, laboratory components help students connect theoretical concepts to their own exercise experiences and introduce them to data collection, analysis, and interpretation using classic techniques. Most courses include a lab protocol that involves exhaustive incremental exercise during which expired gas volumes and concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide are measured. During these protocols, there are characteristic alterations in gas exchange and ventilatory profiles that give rise to two exercise thresholds: the gas exchange threshold (GET) and the respiratory compensation point (RCP). The ability to explain why these thresholds occur and how they are identified is fundamental to learning in exercise physiology and requisite to the understanding of core concepts including exercise intensity, prescription, and performance. Proper identification of GET and RCP requires the assembly of eight data plots. In the past, the burden of time and expertise required to process and prepare data for interpretation has been a source of frustration. In addition, students often express a desire for more opportunities to practice/refine their skills. The objective of this article is to share a blended laboratory model that features the "Exercise Thresholds App," a free online resource that eliminates postprocessing of data and provides a bank of profiles on which end-users can practice threshold identification skills with immediate feedback. In addition to including prelaboratory and postlaboratory recommendations, we present student accounts of understanding, engagement, and satisfaction following completion of the laboratory experience and introduce a new quiz feature of the app to assist instructors with evaluating student learning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We present a laboratory to study exercise thresholds from gas exchange and ventilatory measures that features the "Exercise Thresholds App," a free online resource that eliminates postprocessing of data and provides a bank of profiles on which end-users can practice threshold identification skills.

AB COVID-19 necessitated online teaching (OT) during the second half of the spring 2020 semester. The perceptions of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty of OT at a two-year (2-YI) and a four-year (4-YI) institution were examined during this sudden switchover. One group of educators had received flipped teaching (FT) training (FTEs, n = 23), whereas the other group was practicing traditional teaching (TTEs, n = 18). There were two cohorts of FTEs: cohort 1 were implementing FT for the third time in their classrooms, and cohort 2 had started for the first time. The survey results suggested that FTEs were more confident with OT than TTEs (P < 0.05). It was interesting to note that 62.5% of the FTEs, whether they were from cohort 1 or cohort 2, chose an asynchronous approach, whereas 37.5% delivered synchronous OT during the sudden transition. It was found that FT experience helped cohort 1 adjust to OT compared with cohort 2. Overall, these results suggest that FTEs were confident and their resources for FT eased the transition to OT.

One group had received flipped teaching (FT) training (FTEs), whereas the others practiced traditional teaching (TTEs). Among two cohorts of FTEs, cohort 1 had been practicing FT but not cohort 2. FTEs were more confident with OT than TTEs. FT experience helped cohort 1 adjust to OT more than cohort 2. Overall, FT eased the transition to OT.

AB The Wiggers diagram showing simultaneous events of the cardiac cycle in composite graphs is one of the most intimidating figures students encounter in their study of physiology. This paper describes a discovery learning activity that walks students through the construction of the Wiggers diagram by focusing on the core concepts of blood flow down pressure gradients and the structure-function relationship of heart valves and one-way blood flow through the heart. Additional tasks require students to transfer their understanding to previously unstudied scenarios and figures, such as the left ventricular pressure-volume loop.

AB China's Clinical Medicine Level Test (CMLT) was designed to evaluate the key factors that affect the learning outcome of medical students prior to entering clinical practice. In this study, we systemically analyzed the performance of a cohort of medical students at Jinan University School of Medicine participating in the recent CMLT. The analytical results of the medical students' written and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scores showed that their academic performance was predominantly associated with students' internship allocations, although other demographic characteristics such as sex, age, geographical origin of students, and grade point average (GPA) might be sporadically related to the students' OSCE performance at different OSCE stations. To explore the inherent reasons behind this, a survey was implemented among the medical students who participated in the examination to further interpret the factors influencing the students' learning outcome. The findings of this questionnaire manifested that intrinsic motivation and identified regulation acted as the major motivational profiles for the medical students from three different internship sites, whereas external regulation emerged as the crucial factor to make the students perform well academically in the CMLT. The result of this study suggested that strengthening the quality control of the clinical learning environment and improving medical administration may still be the most effective approaches to ensure the quality of clinical medical education.

AB Problem-based learning (PBL) offers advantages for teaching anatomy and physiology for physical therapy students as clinical cases provide a scaffold for a comprehensive review of body systems. Although the utilization of interactive anatomy software greatly contributes to an active learning environment and efficient use of time, simply providing textbook readings, access to anatomy software, and models is not enough to engage students to become active in reaching their learning goals. Time constraints, meaningful technology implementation, resource abundance, and unfamiliarity are challenges that decrease the effectiveness of both facilitating and learning anatomy. The present study investigated the use of three supplemental learning tools to support anatomy instruction in a self-regulated manner. Friedman test results demonstrated significant differences for perceived engagement [chi(2) (2) = 15.74, P < 0.001, W = 0.23] but not for perceived learning. Survey responses demonstrated that perceived engagement was greatest with the nondigital supplemental learning tool compared with the two technology-enhanced learning tools (iBooks Author + SoftChalk and SoftChalk alone). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated statistically significant relationships between the nondigital supplemental learning tool and anatomy practical scores (P < 0.001). The technology-enhanced supplemental learning tools did not further increase learning outcomes as measured by practical scores compared with nondigital learning tools. Incorporation of instructor-created instructional materials independent of technology is an efficient method to drive self-regulated learning, enhance engagement, and improve anatomy course outcomes and may overcome barriers associated with a purely self-directed PBL model.

AB Programming is an important skill for different areas of knowledge. While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students. Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.

AB The relationship between pH, pK(a), and degree of local anesthetic ionization is quantified by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. As presented in standard textbooks, the effect of pH on the degree of ionization of any particular local anesthetic is not immediately clear due to the x-axis displaying pH - pK(a), which requires conversion to pH, based on the pK(a) for each local anesthetic, a complex process. We present a graphical solution that clarifies the interrelationships between pH, pK(a), and degree of ionization by plotting pK(a) on the x-axis versus the percentage of unionized local anesthetic on the y-axis. The vertical intercept from the x-axis to the pH curves allows rapid and accurate estimation of the degree of ionization of any local anesthetic of known pK(a).

AB Medical students have difficulty understanding the mechanisms underlying hyperkalemia-mediated local control of blood flow. Such control mechanisms are crucial in the brain, kidney. and skeletal muscle vasculature. We aimed to identify medical students' misconceptions via assessment of students' in-class knowledge and, subsequently, improve future teaching of this concept. In-class polling was performed with the Turning-Point clicker response system (n = 860) to gauge students' understanding of three physiological concepts related to hyperkalemia: membrane potential (V-m), conductance, and smooth muscle response. V-m includes the concepts of equilibrium potential (V-eq) for specific ions, as well as driving force (DF = V-m - V-eq). Students understood the concept of DF (similar to 70% answered correctly), suggesting their understanding of V-m. However, students misunderstood that hyperkalemia results in depolarization (similar to 52% answered correctly) and leads to an increase in potassium conductance (similar to 31% answered correctly). Clarification of the type of smooth muscle as vascular increased the percentage of correct responses (similar to 51 to 73%). The data indicate that students lacked knowledge of specific potassium conductance in various muscle types, resulting in divergent responses, such as the canonical depolarization in skeletal muscle versus hyperpolarization in smooth muscle cells during hyperkalemia. Misunderstanding of this crucial concept of conductance is directly related to the students' performance. Furthermore, we connected the paradoxical effect of hyperkalemia to pathological acute and chronic hyperkalemia clinical scenarios.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

ID SCIENCE; AGREEMENT; MUSIC
AB The possible benefits of using music to enhance learning of STEM content are numerous, diverse, and largely unproven. We sought to determine which (if any) of these possible benefits are commonly experienced by undergraduate students and are thus especially worthy of further investigation. Four hundred ninety-three students in nine physiology courses at two midsized American universities rated the usefulness of short instructor-penned mathematical physiology songs and explained in their own words why each song would or would not be a useful study aid. The students collectively perceived the usefulness of each song to depend on both academic factors (e.g.. the lyrics' clarity or relevance to the course) and aesthetic values (e.g.. the appeal of the rhythm or the quality of the singing). Most strikingly, although students' free responses were brief (median length: 18 words in study phase 1, 16 words in study phase 2), nearly one-half of them (1.039 of 2,191) concerned memory, suggesting that many students see educational songs primarily as mnemonic devices. A second major theme of students' comments concerned the conciseness and information density of the songs. Though all 10 songs were brief, lasting 17-54 s, students seemed to prefer shorter songs (perhaps better called "jingles"). This first-of-its-kind data set on student perceptions of educational songs should inform the creation and usage of such songs, as well as further research on their possible value.

AB Lewis Victor Heilbrunn has been called the pioneer of Ca2+ as an intracellular regulator (Campbell AK. Cell Calcium 7: 287-296, 1986; Campbell AK. Intracellular Calcium, 2015). In 1947, he was the first to provide convincing evidence that Ca2+ triggered muscle contraction (Heilbrunn LV, Wiercinski FJ. J Cell Comp Physiol 29: 15-32, 1947). Yet his work was met mostly with silence and neglect. One wonders why. Heilbrunn was a general physiologist who believed in the uniformity of nature with regard to movement. He believed that "... the theory of what makes cells divide should not be very different from the theory of what makes muscle contract..." (Heilbrunn LV. The Dynamics of Living Protoplasm, 1956). He did not believe that one could understand how the living machine worked by investigating its parts. He believed that, to understand life, one must study the dynamics of living protoplasm. The origin and evolution of Heilbrunn's thought process regarding the role of Ca2+ as a physiological activator will be traced back to the 1920s. The ways in which he tested the Ca2+ hypothesis in sea urchin eggs in the 1920s and 1930s will be explored. This work shaped Heilbrunn's thinking about the role of Ca2+ in muscle contraction. Importantly, why he and his results were ignored for years will be examined. It turned out that being right was not enough. Bad luck and a stubborn belief in an outmoded scientific philosophy contributed to the neglect.

AB The purpose of this outreach program was to promote elementary school students' understanding of human physiology and exercise science. I conducted this outreach event for 421 pre-kindergarten through grade 5 students attending a Spanish-immersion elementary school within a large, urban public school district in Kentucky. To meet the needs of the school's minority students. I delivered the Physiology Understanding (PhUn) program bilingually in both English and Spanish. The University of Louisville's PhUn team was composed of 14 undergraduate students, 5 graduate students, and 3 other faculty scientists who participated and supported me throughout the delivery of this outreach program. Elementary school students were taught about science, learned how to make scientific discoveries, and made predictions to test the hypothesis that heart rate increases with exercise. Hands-on activities and demonstrations included use of oxymeters, heart rate monitors, spirometry, blood pressure at rest and during exercise, and electromyography. We invited grade 4 and 5 students to participate in a science fair in which 32 students designed their own research projects and presented their findings during the science fair in three categories: English, Spanish, and bilingual.

AB An increase in the beat-to-beat variability of heart rate (HRV) is a robust marker of enhanced parasympathetic activity and of a calm and relaxed state. The purpose of this laboratory activity was to introduce the concept of HRV to our students, while having them address a novel question of whether two yogic breathing techniques. namely alternate nostril breathing (ANB) and standard deep breathing (DB), impact the SD of instantaneous heart rate (SDHR), a measure of HRV. Fifty-five undergraduates enrolled in a physiology course designed for nonscience majors were tasked with analyzing HR and SDHR from electrocardiograms recorded during normal breathing, DB, and ANB. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that HR was significantly. albeit slightly, elevated from normal (74.5 +/- 13.4 beats/min; means +/- SD) during DB (76.5 +/- 11.2 beats/min), but not during ANB (75.7 +/- 10.1 beats/min). Analysis of SDHR showed significant differences between conditions (normal: 5.5 +/- 2.1, DB: 8.6 +/- 3.0, ANB: 7.8 +/- 2.8 beats/min). The instructors further analyzed the same data set using more robust measures of HRV (SD of sequential N-N intervals, root mean square of successive differences, and high-frequency domain of HRV) to determine whether SDHR during a 2-min epoch is a sufficient measure for HRV in the undergraduate course setting. Statistical analysis for these measures showed a near identical pattern of magnitude and significance among the groups as SDHR. Our students developed a greater appreciation for the effects of breathing patterns on HRV and FIR. using the simple measure of SDHR.

AB Prelaboratory tasks are used to facilitate learning and introduce and provide context for laboratory work. The application of first-person perspective (FPP) technology may provide interesting new approaches to providing prelaboratory preparation. However, there is limited knowledge as to whether this perspective is useful or enjoyable for students preparing for laboratory tasks. The purpose of this study was to examine whether prelaboratory preparation, utilizing the FPP technique, was enjoyable and led to improvements in laboratory task-specific self-efficacy in comparison to the traditional text-only (TO) style. We observed that the FPP group found the style to be generally more enjoyable. entertaining, and generally fun compared with the TO group (5.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.7 +/- 0.3, respectively, P < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the FPP group had a greater laboratory task-specific self-efficacy than their counterparts in the TO group, following the prelaboratory preparation (93.6 +/- 1.6 and 83.5 +/- 3.2. respectively, P < 0.05). We did not find any differences in scenario-based self-efficacy between the FPP and the TO group. Taken together, our data support the use of FPP videos as a novel, refreshing approach to prelaboratory preparation that builds self-efficacy in students performing laboratory tasks.

AB Undergraduate biomedical students often have difficulties in understanding basic concepts of respiratory physiology. particularly respiratory mechanics. In this study, we report the use of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to improve and consolidate the knowledge about physiological aspects of normal regional distribution of ventilation in humans. Initially, we assessed the previous knowledge of a group of medical students (n = 39) about regional differences in lung ventilation. Thereafter, we recorded the regional distribution of ventilation through surface electrodes on a healthy volunteer adopting four different decubitus positions: supine, prone, and right and left lateral. The recordings clearly showed greater pulmonary ventilation in the dependent lung, mainly in the lateral decubitus. Considering the differences in pulmonary ventilation between right and left lateral decubitus, only 33% of students were able to notice it correctly beforehand. This percentage increased to 84 and 100%, respectively (P < 0.01), after the results of the ventilation measurements obtained with EIT were examined and discussed. A self-assessment questionnaire showed that students considered the practical activity as an important tool to assist in the understanding of the basic concepts of respiratory mechanics. Experimental demonstration of the physiological variations of regional lung ventilation in volunteers by using EIT is feasible, effective, and stimulating for undergraduate medical students. Therefore, this practical activity may help faculty and students to overcome the challenges in the field of respiratory physiology learning.

AB Physiology education research aims to investigate teaching-learning aspects and methods specifically applied to physiology teaching and learning. In this paper exploring Brazilian research public data and information from the Brazilian Physiological Society Teaching Committee, we investigated the status of this research topic (physiology education) in Brazil. The data showed that physiology education research needs to be more recognized and supported in Brazil, and more physiologists may become interested in research in this field. Thus this field will become more developed during the physiologists' education.

AB Interactive laboratory class (ILC) is a two-way communication teaching method that encourages students to correlate laboratory findings with materials from lectures. In Thai medical education, active learning methods are uncommon. This paper aims to establish 1) if ILCs would effectively promote physiology learning; 2) if effectiveness would be found in both previously academically high-performing and low-performing students; and 3) the acceptability of ILCs to Thai medical students as a novel learning method. Two hundred seventy-eight second-year medical students were recruited to this study. We conducted three ILC sessions, which followed corresponding lectures. We carried out multiple-choice pre-and post-ILC assessments of knowledge and compared by repeatedmeasures ANOVA and unpaired t-test. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare high-performance (HighP) and low-performance (LowP) students. After the ILCs, participants self-rated their knowledge and satisfaction. Post-ILC test scores increased significantly compared with pre-ILC test scores in all three sessions. Mean scores of each post-ILC test increased significantly from pre-ILC test in both LowP and HighP groups. More students self-reported a "very high" and "high" level of knowledge after ILCs. Most students agreed that ILCs provided more discussion opportunity, motivated their learning, and made lessons more enjoyable. As an adjunct to lectures, ILCs can enhance knowledge in medical students, regardless of previous academic performance. Students perceived ILC as useful and acceptable. This study supports the active learning methods in physiology education, regardless of cultural context.

DE whiteboarding; physiology education; active learning; retrieval strategy
AB Research underscores the importance of retrieval-based practice and application of knowledge for meaningful learning. However, the didactic lecture format continues to persist in traditional university physiology courses. A strategy called whiteboarding, where students use handheld dry erase boards and work in small groups to actively retrieve, discuss, and apply concepts presented in the lecture, has the potential to address challenges associated with actively engaging students in science courses for greater learning. The purpose of this study was to empirically examine the potential benefits of whiteboarding for increasing students' understanding of animal physiology concepts. Student performance on physiology questions assessing concepts taught using lecture only vs. concepts taught using lecture and whiteboarding were compared within the term that whiteboarding was used, as well as across whiteboard and lecture-only terms taught by the same instructor. Results showed that when whiteboarding was incorporated in the course, student performance on items that assessed concepts corresponding to the whiteboarding activities were significantly higher compared with performance on items that assessed concepts taught through lecture only. These patterns in student performance were found within and across terms. Taken together, findings point to whiteboarding as an effective tool that can be integrated in traditional lecture courses to promote students' understanding of physiology.

AB In response to the Bologna Declaration and contemporary trends in Animal Physiology education, the Animal Physiology course at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, has evolved over a 12-yr period (2001-2012): from a classical two-semester course toward a one-semester course utilizing computer simulations of animal experiments, continual assessment, lectures, and an optional oral exam. This paper presents an overview of student achievement, the impact of reforms on learning outcomes, and lessons that we as educators learned during this process. The reforms had a positive impact on the percentage of students who completed the course within the same academic year. In addition, the percentage of students who completed the practical exam increased from 54% to > 95% following the transition to a Bologna-based approach. However, average final grades declined from 8.0 to 6.8 over the same period. Students also appear reluctant to take the optional oral exam, and 82-91% of students were satisfied with the lower final grade obtained from only assessments and tests administered during the semester. In our endeavor to achieve learning outcomes set during the pre-Bologna period, while adopting contemporary teaching approaches, we sought to increase students' motivation to strive toward better performance, while ensuring that the increased quantity of students who complete the course is coupled with increased quality of education and a more in-depth understanding of animal physiology.

AB Life science professional societies play important roles for undergraduates in their fields and increasingly offer membership, fellowships, and awards for undergraduate students. However, the overall impacts of society-student interactions have not been well studied. Here, we sought to develop and test a pilot survey of undergraduate students to determine how they got involved in research and in presenting at the Experimental Biology (EB) meeting, what they gained from the scientific and career development sessions at the meeting, and how the American Physiological Society (APS) can best support and engage undergraduate students. This survey was administered in 2014 and 2015 to undergraduate students who submitted physiology abstracts for and attended EB. More than 150 students responded (38% response rate). Respondents were demographically representative of undergraduate students majoring in life sciences in the United States. Most students (72%) became involved in research through a summer research program or college course. They attended a variety of EB sessions, including poster sessions and symposia, and found them useful. Undergraduate students interacted with established researchers at multiple venues. Students recommended that APS provide more research fellowships (25%) and keep in touch with students via both e-mail (46%) and social media (37%). Our results indicate that APS' EB undergraduate activities are valued by students and are effective in helping them have a positive scientific meeting experience. These results also guided the development of a more streamlined survey for use in future years.

AB The landmark report by de Bold et al. in 1981 signified the heart as one of the endocrine organs involved in fluid and salt balance (de Bold AJ, Borenstein HB, Veress AT, Sonnenberg H. Life Sci 28: 89-94, 1981). Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are secreted from cardiomyocytes in response to cardiac stretch as in the case of heart failure, whereas C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is secreted from endothelial and renal cells in response to cytokines and endothelium-dependent agonists, such as acetylcholine. Binding ANP or BNP to natriuretic peptide receptor A induces cyclic guanylyl monophosphate as second messenger in the target cells to mediate the following: natriuresis; water diuresis; increasing glomerular filtration rate; decreasing systemic sympathetic activities; plasma volume; cardiac output and blood pressure; and curbing mitoses of heart fibroblasts and hypertrophy of cardiovascular muscle cells. ANP, BNP, and CNP are cleared from the bloodstream by natriuretic peptide receptor C and degraded by an ectoenzyme called neprilysin (NEP). The plasma levels of BNP are typically >100 pg/ml in patients with congestive heart failure. Sacubitril/valsartan is an angiotensin receptor NEP inhibitor that prevents the clinical progression of surviving patients with heart failure more effectively than enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. A thorough understanding of the renal and cardiovascular effects of natriuretic peptides is of major importance for first-year medical students to gain insight into the significance of plasma levels of BNP in patients with heart failure.

AB This brief review, which is based on a lecture presented at the American Physiological Society Teaching Refresher Course on the Brain and Systems Control as part of the Experimental Biology meeting in 2015, aims to summarize current concepts of the principal mechanisms in the brain that regulate the autonomic outflow to the cardiovascular system. Such cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms do not operate in isolation but are closely coordinated with respiratory and other regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. The brain regulates the cardiovascular system by two general means: 1) feedforward regulation, often referred to as "central command," and 2) feedback or reflex regulation. In most situations (e.g., during exercise, defensive behavior, sleep, etc.), both of these general mechanisms contribute to overall cardiovascular homeostasis. The review first describes the mechanisms and central circuitry subserving the baroreceptor, chemoreceptor, and other reflexes that work together to regulate an appropriate level of blood pressure and blood oxygenation and then considers the brain mechanisms that defend the body against more complex environmental challenges, using dehydration and cold and heat stress as examples. The last section of the review considers the central mechanisms regulating cardiovascular function associated with different behaviors, with a specific focus on defensive behavior and exercise.

AB Ultrasound has become a widely used diagnostic technique. While its role in patient evaluation is well known, its utility during preclinical courses such as anatomy and physiology is becoming increasingly recognized. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility/utility of integrating ultrasound-based sessions into conventional undergraduate medical school programs of physiology of the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular reflexes and to evaluate student perceptions of an ultrasound-based didactic session. Second-year medical students enrolled in the University of Padova attended a didactic session during which basic concepts regarding ultrasound instrumentation, image production, and spatial orientation were presented. Five anatomic sectors (the heart, aorta, neck vessels, inferior vena cava, and femoral veins) were then examined on a volunteer. Student perceptions of the images that were projected, the usefulness of the presentation, and the reproducibility of the experience were assessed at the end of the lecture with an anonymous questionnaire consisting of positive and negative items that were rated using a 5-point Likert scale and with two questions. One hundred eleven students attended the lecture; 99% of them found it very interesting, and none considered it boring or a waste of time. More than 96% thought it helped them to gain a better comprehension of the subject and would recommend it to a colleague. In conclusion, as ultrasound has been found to be a valuable resource for the teaching of physiology of the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular reflexes, efforts should be made to integrate ultrasound sessions into the traditional human physiology curriculum.

AB Notable challenges, such as mental distress, boredom, negative moods, and attitudes, have been associated with learning in the cadaver dissection laboratory (CDL). The ability of background music (BM) to enhance the cognitive abilities of students is well documented. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of BM in the CDL and on stress associated with the dissection experience. After 8 wk of normal dissection without BM, various genres of BM were introduced into the cadaver dissection sessions of 260 medical and dental students for 3 wk. Feedback on the impact of BM on students in the CDL and students' attitude were accessed using a questionnaire. Psychological stress assessment was done using Psychological Stress Measure 9. Two batches of 30 students each were made to dissect same areas of the body for 2 h, one batch with BM playing and the other batch without. The same examination was given to both groups at the end. Over 90% of the participants expressed a desire to incorporate BM into the CDL; 87% of the sampled population that expressed love for music also reported BM to be a very useful tool that could be used to enhance learning conditions in the CDL. A strong positive relationship was established between love for music and its perception as a tool for learning in the CDL (P < 0.001). Students that studied under the influence of BM had significantly higher scores (P < 0.001) in the overall examination result. BM reduced the level of stress associated with the dissection experience by similar to 33%.

AB Increasing the lifespan of a population is often a marker of a country's success. With the percentage of the population over 65 yr of age expanding, managing the health and independence of this population is an ongoing concern. Advancing age is associated with a decrease in cognitive function that ultimately affects quality of life. Understanding potential adverse effects of aging on brain blood flow and cognition may help to determine effective strategies to mitigate these effects on the population. Exercise may be one strategy to prevent or delay cognitive decline. This review describes how aging is associated with cardiovascular disease risks, vascular dysfunction, and increasing Alzheimer's disease pathology. It will also discuss the possible effects of aging on cerebral vascular physiology, cerebral perfusion, and brain atrophy rates. Clinically, these changes will present as reduced cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and the onset of dementia. Regular exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, and we hypothesize that this occurs through beneficial adaptations in vascular physiology and improved neurovascular coupling. This review highlights the potential interactions and ideas of how the age-associated variables may affect cognition and may be moderated by regular exercise.

ID SYMMETRIZED PERCENT CHANGE
AB Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This tenth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the analysis of a potential change in some physiological response. As researchers, we often express absolute change as percent change so we can account for different initial values of the response. But this creates a problem: percent change is really just a ratio, and a ratio is infamous for its ability to mislead. This means we may fail to find a group difference that does exist, or we may find a group difference that does not exist. What kind of an approach to science is that? In contrast, analysis of covariance is versatile: it can accommodate an analysis of the relationship between absolute change and initial value when percent change is useless.

AB High failure rates in introductory college science courses, including anatomy and physiology, are common at institutions across the country, and determining the specific factors that contribute to this problem is challenging. To identify students at risk for failure in introductory physiology courses at our open-enrollment institution, an online pilot survey was administered to 200 biology students. The survey results revealed several predictive factors related to academic preparation and prompted a comprehensive analysis of college records of >2,000 biology students over a 5-yr period. Using these historical data, a model that was 91% successful in predicting student success in these courses was developed. The results of the present study support the use of surveys and similar models to identify at-risk students and to provide guidance in the development of evidence-based advising programs and pedagogies. This comprehensive approach may be a tangible step in improving student success for students from a wide variety of backgrounds in anatomy and physiology courses.

AB Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of death in the United States and other modern societies. Advancing age is the major risk factor for CVD, primarily due to stiffening of the large elastic arteries and the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction. In contrast, regular aerobic exercise protects against the development of large elastic artery stiffness and vascular endothelial dysfunction with advancing age. Moreover, aerobic exercise interventions reduce arterial stiffness and restore vascular endothelial function in previously sedentary middle-aged/older adults. Aerobic exercise exerts its beneficial effects on arterial function by modulating structural proteins, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and restoring nitric oxide bioavailability. Aerobic exercise may also promote "resistance" against factors that reduce vascular function and increase CVD risk with age. Preventing excessive increases in abdominal adiposity, following healthy dietary practices, maintaining a low CVD risk factor profile, and, possibly, selective use of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals also play a major role in preserving vascular function with aging.

AB Digestive physiology laboratory exercises often explore the regulation of enzyme action rather than systems physiology. This laboratory exercise provides a systems approach to digestive and regulatory processes through the exploration of postprandial blood glucose levels. In the present exercise, students enrolled in an undergraduate animal physiology course select to participate in either an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or one of the following three meal treatments based on typical student breakfasts: 1) high glycemic load (HGL), 2) moderate glycemic load (MGL), and 3) low glycemic load (LGL). The caloric value of the meals is 540 kcal. An Accucheck glucometer is used to determine fasted and 30-, 60-, and 120-min postprandial blood glucose levels. Students discover that postprandial glucose levels peak similarly for the OGTT and HGL group (137 +/- 7.1 and 145 +/- 4.7mg/dl) and remain higher than MGL and LGL groups over the 2-h period. Between sampling, vibrant discussion covering such topics as glucose and cognitive function, insulin resistance, epigenetics, and fad diets occurs. The postlaboratory assignment requires students to discuss the importance of glucose homeostasis, graphically summarize their findings, review the literature to describe results in light of published data, and describe relationships between hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and disease processes. Students evaluated this laboratory as highly effective and one of the top three experiences of the course.

Adv Physiol Educ 37: 85-88, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00119.2012.-The aim of this research was to determine the satisfaction of medical students with problem-based learning (PBL) and their approaches to learning to investigate the effect of learning approaches on their levels of satisfaction. The study group was composed of medical students from three different universities, which apply PBL at different levels in their curricula. The revised two-factor study process survey was applied to the study group to determine their approaches to learning as "deep" or "surface" learning. In addition, another survey of 20 questions was used to determine satisfaction levels of students with PBL and other variables. Of the study group, 64.6% were found to adopt a deep approach to learning, and we confirmed that these students were reasonably more satisfied with PBL.

AB Ryan KL. APS at 125: a look back at the founding of the American Physiological Society. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 10-14, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00143.2012.-Early efforts in physiological research in the United States were produced by lone investigators working in laboratories funded by their own medical practices. In Europe, however, Claude Bernard and Carl Ludwig produced a new model of scientific research laboratories funded by the state that sought to develop the pursuit of biomedical research as an occupation. American physicians such as Henry Pickering Bowditch and S. Weir Mitchell were exposed to this new "research ethic" during their international studies and brought this new perspective home to America. Along with H. Newell Martin, these men began training professional physiologists who would assume new research positions in academic institutions. In 1887, Bowditch, Mitchell, and H. Newell Martin proposed the formation of a new society for these professional physiologists, the American Physiological Society (APS). Seventeen of the original twenty-eight members met on December 30, 1887, in New York City, NY, to establish APS. From these humble beginnings, APS evolved to become a force for change in American biomedical science.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 181-187, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00072.2012. -Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This eighth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores permutation methods, empiric procedures we can use to assess an experimental result-to test a null hypothesis-when we are reluctant to trust statistical theory alone. Permutation methods operate on the observations-the data-we get from an experiment. A permutation procedure answers this question: out of all the possible ways we can rearrange the observations we got, in what proportion of those arrangements is the sample statistic we care about at least as extreme as the one we got? The answer to that question is the P value.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 125-130, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00095.2011.-Students struggle with the volume and complexity of physiology terminology. We compared first-year undergraduate psychology students' learning of physiological terms using two teaching methods: one verbal (control group; n = 16) and one spatial and multisensory (experimental group; n = 19). The experimental group used clear plastic shower caps to mark brain regions and affix labels to another participant's head. The control group learned the material verbally through a game. When tested verbally, both the control and experimental groups recalled more of the 10 terms immediately after the activity (+106% and +83%, respectively) and 2 wk later (+53% and +31%, respectively) than at the pretest (P < 0.0005). When participants' knowledge was tested spatially (labeling a brain diagram), the experimental group recalled more terms at the posttest (+76%) and followup (+73%) than at the pretest (P < 0.0005), but the control group who showed no improvement at either time point (+12% and +14%, respectively). These findings support the notion that spatial and multisensory learning produces improved spatial recall over time while also supporting the notion of transfer-appropriate processing.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 219-226, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00135.2010.Thyroid diseases are prevalent among endocrine disorders, and careful evaluation of patients' symptoms is a very important part in their diagnosis. Developing new pedagogical strategies, such as problem-based learning (PBL), is extremely important to stimulate and encourage medical and biomedical students to learn thyroid physiology and identify the signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. The present study aimed to create a new pedagogical approach to build deep knowledge about hypo-/hyperthyroidism by proposing a hands-on activity based on a detective case, using alternative materials in place of laboratory animals. After receiving a description of a criminal story involving changes in thyroid hormone economy, students collected data from clues, such as body weight, mesenteric vascularization, visceral fat, heart and thyroid size, heart rate, and thyroid-stimulating hormone serum concentration to solve the case. Nevertheless, there was one missing clue for each panel of data. Four different materials were proposed to perform the same practical lesson. Animals, pictures, small stuffed toy rats, and illustrations were all effective to promote learning, and the detective case context was considered by students as inviting and stimulating. The activity can be easily performed independently of the institution's purchasing power. The practical lesson stimulated the scientific method of data collection and organization, discussion, and review of thyroid hormone actions to solve the case. Hence, this activity provides a new strategy and alternative materials to teach without animal euthanization.

AB Luckie D, Harrison SH, Ebert-May D. Model-based reasoning: using visual tools to reveal student learning. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 59-67, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00016.2010.-Using visual models is common in science and should become more common in classrooms. Our research group has developed and completed studies on the use of a visual modeling tool, the Concept Connector. This modeling tool consists of an online concept mapping Java applet that has automatic scoring functions we refer to as Robograder. The Concept Connector enables students in large introductory science courses to visualize their thinking through online model building. The Concept Connector's flexible scoring system, based on tested grading schemes as well as instructor input, has enabled > 1,000 physiology students to build maps of their ideas about plant and animal physiology with the guidance of automatic and immediate online scoring of homework. Criterion concept maps developed by instructors in this project contain numerous expert-generated or "correct" propositions connecting two concept words together with a linking phrase. In this study, holistic algorithms were used to test automated methods of scoring concept maps that might work as well as a human grader.

AB Thomas GD. Neural control of the circulation. Adv Physiol Educ 35:28-32, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00114.2010.-The purpose of this brief review is to highlight key concepts about the neural control of the circulation that graduate and medical students should be expected to incorporate into their general knowledge of human physiology. The focus is largely on the sympathetic nerves, which have a dominant role in cardiovascular control due to their effects to increase cardiac rate and contractility, cause constriction of arteries and veins, cause release of adrenal catecholamines, and activate the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system. These effects, as well as the control of sympathetic outflow by the vasomotor center in the medulla and the importance of sensory feedback in the form of peripheral reflexes, especially the baroreflexes, are discussed in the context of cardiovascular regulation.

AB This article unpacks the core concept of the "movement of substances" within the body, with the aim to produce a resource that will help guide the teaching of physiology at tertiary education institutes in Australia. The concept introduces fundamental knowledge of the factors that drive substance movement and then applies them in physiological contexts.
   Australia-wide consensus was reached on seven core concepts of physiology. The "movement of substances" core concept with the descriptor "the movement of substances (ions or molecules) is a fundamental process that occurs at all levels of organization in the organism" was unpacked by a team of three Australian physiology educators from the Delphi Task Force into hierarchical levels. There were 10 themes and 23 subthemes arranged in a hierarchy, some 3 levels deep. Using a 5-point Likert scale, the unpacked core concept was then rated for level of importance for students to understand (ranging from 1 = Essential to 5 = Not Important) and level of difficulty for students (ranging from 1 = Very Difficult to 5 = Not Difficult) by the 23 physiology educators from different Australian universities, all with a broad range of teaching and curriculum experience. Survey data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to compare between and within concept themes. The main themes all were rated on average as important. There was a wide range of difficulty ratings and more variation for this concept compared with the other core concepts. This may in part be due to the physical forces such as gravity, electrochemistry, resistance, and thermodynamics that underpin this concept, which in themselves are inherently complex. Separation of concepts into subthemes can help prioritize learning activities and time spent on difficult concepts. Embedding of core concepts across curricula will allow commonality and consistency between programs of study and inform learning outcomes, assessment, and teaching and learning activities.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article unpacks the core concept of the "movement of substances" within the body, with the aim to produce a resource that will help guide the teaching of physiology at tertiary education institutes in Australia.

ID CLASSROOM ASSESSMENT
AB Both summative and formative assessments are known to facilitate student learning and understanding and help students to identify areas of weakness. However, few studies have investigated students' preference for either summative or formative eval-uations, particularly in the area of preclinical medicine. The current study addresses this deficit by surveying 137 first-year gradu-ate entry to medicine (GEM) preclinical medical students from 2 consecutive years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020), for their thoughts on the 6 summative (i.e., for a small percentage of marks), proctored and the 5 informal, formative (i.e., no marks avail-able) continuous assessments in physiology that they encountered in semesters 1 and 2, respectively. Our survey revealed that between 75 and 90% of students felt that both evaluation formats were roughly equally useful (i.e., selecting options, "agree" or "strongly agree") both for providing feedback about their understanding of physiology and for identifying deficits in their physiol-ogy knowledge. However, although a significantly larger number of students felt that summative evaluations motivated them to study more than the formative evaluations (P = 0.006), overall, more students favored formative over summative assessments. Notably, however, GEM students from nonbiomedical backgrounds were significantly more in favor of summative assessments than those from either biomedical backgrounds (P = 0.003) or the whole GEM survey cohort (P = 0.01). The implications of these findings will be discussed, with suggestions as to how the student views outlined here might be facilitated within an academic program to maximize both student learning as well as their motivation to study and keep up with taught material. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although several studies have investigated the relative effectiveness of regular summative versus forma-tive assessments as tools to facilitate student learning and understanding, ours is the first to explicitly solicit students' views on, and preferences for, either regular formative or summative assessment in preclinical medicine. We demonstrate that, overall, stu-dents preferred formative-to summative-type assessments, due to the immediacy of feedback, but also that summative tests incentivized them to study and keep up with material more.

TI Development of the Physiology Professional Skills Curriculum Mapping

DE curriculum; mapping; professional skills; undergraduate
AB During the course of undergraduate studies, physiology (and related STEM) majors should acquire a both broad and in-depth foundation in physiological knowledge along with a distinct range of transferable (professional) skills (e.g., critical thinking, communication skills, data analysis). Previously, through a consultative and iterative process with physiology educators, the Professional Skills Committee of the Physiology Majors Interest Group (PMIG) defined and refined a consensus list of professional skills that physiology majors should acquire during their program of study. Here we describe the development and beta testing of a convenient tool to enable physiology and physiology-related program educators to map these professional skills across their curricula. The tool, referred to as PS-MAP, uses the Qualtrics platform and allows programs to collect and organize data about whether students are provided the opportunity to learn and develop the defined professional skills during their undergraduate experience. The authors have made the PS-MAP tool freely available to educators and provide practical tips for its implementation. Use of the PS-MAP tool and the data collected can help programs identify curricular strengths and gaps as well as facilitate curricular discussions among educators within the program. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In addition to foundational physiology knowledge, undergraduate physiology and related STEM majors should develop a range of transferable professional skills. However, evidence of this curricular goal has been lacking. Therefore, the Professional Skills Committee of the Physiology Majors Interest Group (PMIG) developed the freely available and convenient Physiology Professional Skills Curriculum Mapping Tool (PS-MAP) to assist educators in mapping these professional skills throughout their programs.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic affected almost all aspects of our lives, including the education sector and the way of teaching and learning. In March 2020, health authorities in Brazil imposed social isolation and the interruption of on-site activities in schools and universities. In this context, the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), one of the largest universities in Brazil and Latin America, developed an emergency remote learning (ERL) plan that allowed the return of classes in an online format and supported students to obtain access to equipment and internet network. Within this new perspective, the Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) program of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics (DFIB) explored strategies to minimize the impact of the absence of face-to-face classes. Using different available tools in online platforms and social media such as Microsoft Teams, YouTube animated video classes, and Instagram, the UTA program assisted >500 undergraduate students and strongly supported professors during ERL. In just over a year, our video classes on YouTube Channel reached similar to 40,000 views. Most of the students reported that their questions were fully and quickly solved by the UTA program. Collectively, our results indicate that the strategies implemented by the UTA program helped the undergraduate students and professors to adapt to a remote learning format.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Students often fail to utilize what they know about one topic (e.g., hemodynamics) when attempting to master another topic involving a similar phenomenon (e.g., airflow in airways). What accounts for this difficulty that students have? And how can students be assisted in doing a better job of applying what they already know to new topics? The phenomenon described above is an example of a failure of transfer of learning. However, much is known about the conditions that foster or promote transfer of learning. Applying this emerging knowledge and focusing on the core concepts of physiology can make learning physiology easier and provide students with tools to support lifelong learning.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Students often fail to utilize knowledge from prerequisite courses while learning physiology.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic required a shift to online learning that posed particular challenges for the education of dental students. Basic science courses were presented in an online, asynchronous format to facilitate small group rotations through preclinical work. The success of active learning was previously examined in a Dental Physiology course, and it was desired to reassess those methods in an online environment. Students were provided with prerecorded lectures containing learning activities, and the effectiveness was compared with traditional lecture recordings. On surveys, dental students had more positive perceptions of online recordings that incorporated active learning strategies, with higher perceived effectiveness of the lecturer, ability to pay attention, motivation to study, and confidence with the material. This was similar to the previous study, in which face-2-face (F2F) active learning was more positively reviewed than traditional lectures. Compared with these past sections, the online cohort expressed similarly positive perceptions of the active learning sections, but the online traditional lectures were perceived to be less effective than F2F lectures. Despite the differences in student perceptions, unit exam scores were similar for didactic lectures in both online and F2F settings. Unit exam scores were significantly higher when active learning strategies were employed, with the highest performance levels in the F2F cohort. While active learning strategies continue to be effective, further research is needed to optimize these methods and engage students in online coursework. The results suggest the importance of active and collaborative learning opportunities in the education of students in physiology coursework.

TI An example of functional integration and application of diversity,

AB Increasing diversity, including diverse perspectives in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classrooms and teaching practices, is recognized as a current higher education priority. Resources to assist institutions and instructors are growing; however, many STEM instructors still hesitate to implement diverse teaching practices and discussions of diversity issues in their courses for a variety of reasons. This paper describes an example of the incorporation and discussion of diversity and social justice issues as part of an upper level physiology of aging course. The general approach was to examine the functional intersection of the sociology and physiology using social determinants of health as mechanistic influencers of physiology and examining how they affect healthy aging and etiology of age-associated diseases. Activities included in-class and virtual discussion, collaboration with the university diversity department, and a written assignment where the students explored in depth how a social determinant of health affected molecular physiology of aging. Students were also provided with strategies they can use in careers as health practitioners to be more inclusive in their practices. Student participation and feedback indicated that this approach and activities were engaging, enlightening and useful and should be continued. They specifically appreciated the social issues discussed in their sociology courses being included in their physiology major course and thinking about how those issues are mechanistically linked to physiology. This was the first attempt at this approach, and strategies for future activity improvement and tips for successful implementation are also addressed.

AB Although traditional didactic lecturing is the principal instructional approach used in numerous medical schools, this method has several limitations. Experiential learning approaches place students in the center of the learning process and creates a positive and supportive classroom learning environment. In this article, we propose an active pedagogical approach for teaching a basic physiology concept, namely, neuromuscular transmission (NMT), and we evaluate the effectiveness of this approach among undergraduate medical students. One-hundred forty-two undergraduate medical students were involved in this study (cohort A, n = 62; cohort B, n = 80). Cohort A received a didactic lecture on NMT and subsequently tested their knowledge of the topic via test 1, after which their perceptions of didactic lectures were recorded. The students were then asked to participate in a touchand-go (TAG) active-learning session regarding NMT, after which their learning was subsequently tested by taking test 2. Their perceptions about the TAG game were also recorded. Students in cohort B were first administered test 1 regarding NMT. Then, they were asked to attend a didactic lecture blended with a TAG active-learning session, after which test 2 was administered, and their perceptions were recorded. Both the didactic lecture and active learning sessions facilitated student learning regarding the concepts involved in NMT. A comparison of the lecture followed by the game used in cohort A with the game blended lecture used in cohort B revealed no significant differences. However, both formats created a positive influence on students' interest in learning the concept, and the students preferred active learning over didactic sessions alone.

AB Advances in physiology and other fields are strongly associated with a solid base knowledge of biochemistry and cell metabolism. On the other hand, the complex and abstract nature of metabolic pathways, the traditional lecture method, and other factors made the teaching-learning process of biochemistry a challenging endeavor. To overcome this, we developed and tested a novel active learning tool called Interactive Metabolism (iM-tool). The iM-tool was developed with simple and low-cost materials. We used it for interactive teaching of several metabolic pathways and physiological mechanisms for students enrolled in the Biochemistry subject belonging to different undergraduate courses. The results of evaluation tests showed that the iM-tool significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.01) and consistently improved the biochemistry knowledge of students in classrooms with up to 50 students for 7 different and consecutive academic semesters. A survey intended to mine students' opinions on the tools showed significant satisfaction with the teaching using the iM-tool over traditional lecture-based teaching, and the iM-tool contributed to collaborative learning among students. Therefore, our results showed that the iM-tool improves the biochemistry and cell metabolism teaching-learning process in a more attractive and interactive manner.

AB The COVID-19 crisis necessitated abrupt transition to remote learning in medical schools. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on French undergraduate students and teachers, to identify practice changes, and to evaluate successes and areas for improvement of this remote learning experience. Data from 2 online questionnaires were analyzed with 509 participants among students and 189 among teachers from Sorbonne University. Responses to multiple choice, Likert response scale, and open-ended questions were evaluated. COVID-19 had negative impact on teaching continuity. Sixty-seven percent of students were in a dropout situation, and many suffered from psychological stress, leading to set up of a psychological support unit. Although most teachers (81%) and students (72%) had limited knowledge of digital resources, distance learning was quickly implemented, with a predominant use of Zoom. The analysis of several parameters revealed that students were significantly more satisfied than teachers by remote learning. Nevertheless, both students and teachers agreed to replace classical lectures by digital media and to promote in-person teaching in small interactive groups. This paper shares tips for faculty rapidly establishing remote learning. This comparative study of the students' and teachers' points of view underlines that new medical curricula should include more digital contents. We make recommendations regarding general university organization, equipment, and curricular development for long-term implementation of digital resources with reinforced relationships between faculty and students.

AB Understanding and interpretation of acid-base disorders is an important clinical skill that is applicable to the majority of physicians. Although this topic is taught early in medical school, acid-base disturbances have been described as challenging by postgraduate trainees. We describe the use of Twitter, an online microblogging platform, to augment education in acid-base disturbances by using polls in which the user is shown laboratory values and then asked to select the most likely etiology of the disorder. The answer and a brief explanation are then shared in a subsequent tweet. Both polling questions and answers are shared from the account for the online, mobile-optimized, nephrology teaching tool NephSIM (https://www.nephsim.com/). An anonymous survey was administered to assess attitudes toward these polls. Using Twitter as an approach to enhance teaching of acid-base disturbances was both feasible and an engaging way to teach a challenging topic for trainees and physicians. Moreover, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of incorporating virtual learning opportunities in all levels of medical education.

AB It is important to reinforce physiology and pathophysiology concepts during clinical rotations, which traditionally occur after the foundational sciences in the US medical school system. We took an opportunistic approach when the COVID-19 pandemic forced our content into virtual delivery mode, as clinical medical education required a shift to nonpatient contact. We describe our experience in building a 2-wk course that consisted of online small groups during week 1 and panels and cases during week 2. The physiology content involved faculty-vetted resources, along with both discrete and open-ended focus questions for each learning objective. The course also included mechanical ventilation, and the physiologist utilized discussion points and developed a formative quiz to emphasize the physiology correlates, in addition to the very clinical aspects of mechanical ventilation. There were pathophysiology opportunities with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiple-organ system dysfunction among the clinical correlates. Review and recall of the foundational sciences occurred, allowing links between the pre-clerkship and clerkship years that were previously undiscovered in our institution. This virtually delivered medical curriculum related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 is timely, carries high student interest, and can benefit medical students and the communities they serve.

AB Functional understanding of the different parts of the cardiovascular system is essential for an insight into pathomechanisms of numerous diseases. During training cardiovascular physiology, students and early-stage medical personnel should understand the role of different functional parameters for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as for blood flow. The impact of isolated parameters can only be studied in models. Here physical hydraulic models are an advantage in which the students have a direct contact to the mechanical properties of the circulatory system. But these models are often difficult to handle. The aim of the present study was to develop a comprehensive model of the cardiovascular system, including a mechanical heart with valves, an elastic aorta, a more rigid peripheral artery system, a total peripheral resistance, and a venous reservoir representing the variable cardiac preload. This model allows one to vary systematically several functional parameters and to continuously record their impact on pressure and flow. This model is embedded into a computer-based teaching system (LabTutor) in which the students are guided through the handling of the model (as well as the systematic variation of parameters), and the measured data can be analyzed. This hybrid teaching system, which is routinely integrated in physiology laboratory courses of medical students, allows students to work with a complex hydraulic model of the cardiovascular system and to analyze systematically the impact of influencing variables (e.g., increased peripheral resistance or changed cardiac preload) as well as pathophysiological dysfunctions (e.g., reduced aortic compliance).

AB Different versions of multiple-choice exams were administered to an undergraduate class in human physiology as part of normal testing in the classroom. The goal was to evaluate whether the number of options (possible answers) per question influenced the effectiveness of this assessment. Three exams (each with three versions) were given to each of two sections during an academic quarter. All versions were equally long, with 30 questions: 10 questions with 3 options, 10 questions with 4, and 10 questions with 5 (always one correct answer plus distractors). Each question appeared in all three versions of an exam, with a different number of options in each version (three, four, or five). Discrimination (point biserial and upper-lower discrimination indexes) and difficulty were evaluated for each question. There was a small increase in difficulty (a lower average score on a question) when more options were provided. The upper-lower discrimination index indicated a small improvement in assessment of student learning with more options, although the point biserial did not. The total length of a question (number of words) was associated with a small increase in discrimination and difficulty, independent of the number of options. Quantitative questions were more likely to show an increase its discrimination with more options than nonquantitative questions, but this effect was very small. Therefore, for these testing conditions, there appears to be little advantage in providing more than three options per multiple-choice question, and there are disadvantages, such as needing more time for an exam.

AB In the mammalian lower urinary tract. there is a reciprocal relationship between the contractile state of the bladder and urethra. As the bladder fills with urine, it remains relaxed to accommodate increases in volume, while the urethra remains contracted to prevent leakage of urine from the bladder to the exterior. Disruptions to the normal contractile state of the bladder and urethra can lead to abnormal micturition patterns and urinary incontinence. While both the bladder and urethra are smooth-muscle organs, they are differentially contracted by input from cholinergic and sympathetic nerves, respectively. The laboratory practical described here provides an experiential approach to understanding the anatomy of the lower urinary tract. Several key factors in urinary tract physiology are outlined, e.g., the bladder is contracted by activation of the parasympathetic pathway via cholinergic stimulation on muscarinic receptors, whereas the urethra is contracted by activation of the sympathetic pathway via adrenergic stimulation on alpha(1-)adrenoceptors. This is achieved by measuring the force generated by bladder and urethra smooth muscle to demonstrate that acetylcholine contracts the smooth muscle of the bladder. whereas adrenergic agonists contract the urethral smooth muscle. An inhibition of these effects is also demonstrated by application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine. A list of suggested techniques and exam questions to evaluate student understanding on this topic is also provided.

AB In the Undergraduate School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at the University of Virginia (UVa), there are few opportunities for undergraduate students to teach, let alone develop, an introductory course for their major. As two undergraduate engineering students (D. N. Tavakol and C. J. Broshkevitch), we were among the first students to take advantage of a new initiative at UVa SEAS to offer student-led courses. As part of this new program, we designed a 1000-level, 1-credit, pass-fail course entitled Introduction to Research in Regenerative Medicine. During a student's first year at the University, opportunities to build research skills and gain exposure to topics within the field of the biomedical sciences are relatively rare, so, to fill this gap, we focused our course on teaching primarily freshman undergraduate students how to synthesize and contextualize scientific literature, covering both basic science and clinical applications. At the end of the course, students self-reported increased confidence in reading and discussing scientific papers and review articles. The critical impact of this course lies not only in an early introduction to the popularized field of regenerative medicine, but also encouragement for younger students to participate in research early on and to appreciate the value of interdisciplinary interactions. The teaching model can be extended for implementation of student-taught introductory courses across diverse undergraduate major tracks at an institution.

AB Learning the basic competencies of critical thinking are very important in the education of any young scientist, and teachers must be prepared to help students develop a valuable set of analytic tools. In my experience, this is best achieved by encouraging students to study areas with little scientific consensus, such as the control mechanisms of the exercise ventilatory response, as it can allow greater objectivity when evaluating evidence, while also giving students the freedom to think independently and problem solve. In this article, I discuss teaching strategies by which physiology, biomedical science, and sport science students can simultaneously develop their understanding of respiratory control mechanisms and learn to critically analyze evidence thoroughly. This can be best achieved by utilizing both teacher-led and student-led learning environments, the latter of which encourages the development of learner autonomy and independent problem solving. In this article, I also aim to demonstrate a systematic approach of critical assessment that students can be taught, adapt, and apply independently. Among other things, this strategy involves: 1) defining the precise phenomenon in question; 2) understanding what investigations must demonstrate to explain the phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms; 3) evaluating the explanations/mechanisms of the phenomenon and the evidence for them; and 4) forming strategies to produce strong evidence, if none exists.

AB The flipped classroom was utilized in a two-semester, high-content science course that enrolled between 50 and 80 students at a small liberal arts college. With the flipped model, students watched similar to 20-min lectures 2 days/wk outside of class. These videos were recorded via screen capture and included a detailed note outline, PowerPoint slides, and review questions. The traditional format included the same materials, except that lectures were delivered in class each week and spanned the entire period. During the flipped course, the instructor reviewed common misconceptions and asked questions requiring higher-order thinking, and five graded case studies were performed each semester. To determine whether assessments included additional higher-order thinking skills in the flipped vs. traditional model, questions across course formats were compared via Blooms Taxonomy. Application-level questions that required prediction of an outcome in a new scenario comprised 38 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 1% of summative assessment questions (< 0.01): flipped vs. traditional. Final letter grades in both formats of the course were compared with major GPA. Students in the flipped model performed better than their GPA predicted, as 85.5% earned a higher grade (vs. 42.2% in the traditional classroom) compared with their major GPA. These data demonstrate that assessments transitioned to more application-level compared with factual knowledge-based questions with this particular flipped model, and students performed better in their final letter grade compared with the traditional lecture format. Although the benefits to a flipped classroom are highlighted, student evaluations did suffer. More detailed studies comparing the traditional and flipped formats are warranted.

ID FEEDBACK
AB We investigated how students performed on weekly two-page laboratory reports based on whether the grading rubric was provided to the student electronically or in paper form and the inclusion of one-to two-sentence targeted comments. Subjects were registered for a 289-student, third-year human physiology class with laboratory and were randomized into four groups related to rubric delivery and targeted comments. All students received feedback via the same detailed grading rubric. At the end of the term, subjects provided consent and a self-assessment of their rubric viewing rate and preferences. There were no differences in laboratory report scores between groups (P = 0.86), although scores did improve over time (P < 0.01). Students receiving targeted comments self-reported viewing their rubric more often than students that received no comments (P = 0.02), but the viewing rate was independent of the rubric delivery method (P = 0.15). Subjects with high rubric viewing rates did not have higher laboratory report grades than subjects with low viewing rates (P = 0.64). When asked about their preference for the future, 43% of respondents preferred the same method again (electronic or paper rubric) and 25% had no preference. We conclude that although student laboratory report grades improved over time, the rate and degree of improvement were not related to rubric delivery method or to the inclusion of targeted comments.

AB In the present study, a preparation of frog skin was presented, which can be used to demonstrate the basic concepts of blood flow regulation in a very clear and attractive way to high school and university students. In a freshly euthanized Xenopus, a patch of abdominal skin was exposed from the internal side and viewed with a USB microscope while it remained connected to a functioning circulatory system. In this way, it was possible to obtain sharp images of arteries and veins and to visualize blood flow. This allows students to learn about the functional differences between arteries and veins and about the complexity of hemodynamics as well as the particularities of the amphibian pulmocutaneous circulation. Students can then quantitatively estimate the effect of norepinephrine and epinephrine on the diameter of blood vessels by simply superfusing the skin patch with a series of solutions of the two substances. They can also test the effect of alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, used to treat high blood pressure, on the norepinephrine-induced muscle tonus of blood vessels.

AB While hypertension has predominantly been attributed to perturbations of the vasculature, kidney, and central nervous system, research for almost 50 yr has shown that the immune system also contributes to this disease. Inflammatory cells accumulate in the kidneys and vasculature of humans and experimental animals with hypertension and likely contribute to end-organ damage. We and others have shown that mice lacking adaptive immune cells, including recombinase-activating gene-deficient mice and rats and mice with severe combined immunodeficiency have blunted hypertension to stimuli such as ANG II, high salt, and norepinephrine. Adoptive transfer of T cells restores the blood pressure response to these stimuli. Agonistic antibodies to the ANG II receptor, produced by B cells, contribute to hypertension in experimental models of preeclampsia. The central nervous system seems important in immune cell activation, because lesions in the anteroventral third ventricle block hypertension and T cell activation in response to ANG II. Likewise, genetic manipulation of reactive oxygen species in the subfornical organ modulates both hypertension and immune cell activation. Current evidence indicates that the production of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-17, and interleukin-6, contribute to hypertension, likely via effects on both the kidney and vasculature. In addition, the innate immune system also appears to contribute to hypertension. We propose a working hypothesis linking the sympathetic nervous system, immune cells, production of cytokines, and, ultimately, vascular and renal dysfunction, leading to the augmentation of hypertension. Studies of immune cell activation will clearly be useful in understanding this common yet complex disease.

AB In the frame of a laboratory training course for medicine students, a new approach for laboratory exercises has been applied to teach the phenomena of circulation. The exercise program included measurements of radial artery blood flow waveform for different age groups using a noninvasive optical sensor. Arterial wave reflection was identified by measurements of blood flow waveforms before and after arterial branching. Students were able to distinguish between different waveforms of blood flow within different age groups. Furthermore, students were given the opportunity to explore the effect of aging on the elasticity of blood vessels. This exercise is an introduction to the fundamental physical laws of hemodynamics that can facilitate the learning and understanding of cardiovascular physiology to students of medicine.

AB Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system constantly control the heart (sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions) and blood vessels (predominantly the sympathetic division) to maintain appropriate blood pressure and organ blood flow over sometimes widely varying conditions. This can be adversely affected by pathological conditions that can damage one or both branches of autonomic control. The set of teaching laboratory activities outlined here uses various interventions, namely, 1) the heart rate response to deep breathing, 2) the heart rate response to a Valsalva maneuver, 3) the heart rate response to standing, and 4) the blood pressure response to standing, that cause fairly predictable disturbances in cardiovascular parameters in normal circumstances, which serve to demonstrate the dynamic control of the cardiovascular system by autonomic nerves. These tests are also used clinically to help investigate potential damage to this control.

AB Most undergraduate physiology laboratories are very limited in how they treat renal physiology. It is common to find teaching laboratories equipped with the capability for high-resolution digital recordings of physiological functions (muscle twitches, ECG, action potentials, respiratory responses, etc.), but most urinary laboratories still rely on a "dipstick" approach of urinalysis. Although this technique can provide some basic insights into the functioning of the kidneys, it overlooks the dynamic processes of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. In the present article, we provide a straightforward approach of using renal clearance measurements to estimate glomerular filtration rate, fractional water reabsorption, glucose clearance, and other physiologically relevant parameters. The estimated values from our measurements in laboratory are in close agreement with those anticipated based on textbook parameters. For example, we found glomerular filtration rate to average 124 +/- 45 ml/min, serum creatinine to be 1.23 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, and fractional water reabsorption to be similar to 96.8%. Furthermore, analyses for the class data revealed significant correlations between parameters like fractional water reabsorption and urine concentration, providing opportunities to discuss urine concentrating mechanisms and other physiological processes. The procedures outlined here are general enough that most undergraduate physiology laboratory courses should be able to implement them without difficulty.

TI Flipped classroom model improves graduate student performance in
   cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal physiology
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
DE flipped classroom; didactic lectures; student performance
AB The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a traditional lecture-based curriculum versus a modified "flipped classroom" curriculum of cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal physiology delivered to first-year graduate students. Students in both courses were provided the same notes and recorded lectures. Students in the modified flipped classroom were required to watch the prerecorded lectures before class and then attend class, where they received a quiz or homework covering material in each lecture (valued at 25% of the final grade) followed by a question and answer/problem-solving period. In the traditional curriculum, attending lectures was optional and there were no quizzes. Evaluation of effectiveness and student performance was achieved by having students in both courses take the same multiple-choice exams. Within a comparable group of graduate students, participants in the flipped course scored significantly higher (P <= 0.05) on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and weighted cumulative sections by an average of >12 percentage points. Exam averages for students in the flipped course also tended to be higher on the renal section by similar to 11 percentage points (P = 0.06). Based on our experience and responses obtained in blinded student surveys, we propose that the use of homework and in-class quizzes were critical motivating factors that likely contributed to the increase in student exam performance. Taken together, our findings support that the flipped classroom model is a highly effective means in which to disseminate key physiological concepts to graduate students.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 265-274, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00074.2012.-The goal of this report is to discuss educational approaches for bridging the different perspectives of the physiological and mathematical disciplines. These approaches can enhance the learning experience for physiology, medical, and mathematics students and simultaneously act to stimulate mathematical/physiological/clinical interdisciplinary research. While physiology education incorporates mathematics, via equations and formulas, it does not typically provide a foundation for interdisciplinary research linking mathematics and physiology. Here, we provide insights and ideas derived from interdisciplinary seminars involving mathematicians and physiologists that have been conducted over the last decade. The approaches described here can be used as templates for giving physiology and medical students insights into how sophisticated tools from mathematics can be applied and how the disciplines of mathematics and physiology can be integrated in research, thereby fostering a foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration. These templates are equally applicable to linking mathematical methods with other life and health sciences in the educational process.

AB Stephens PJ. What is the optimum duration of an asynchronous distance learning course? Adv Physiol Educ 36: 143-146, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00083.2011.-An online, lecture/laboratory course in Human Physiology was run in two sections in five consecutive summers. In each year, the two sections were identical in content, assignments, and assessments but were different in duration; the shorter section was 1 mo and the longer section lasted 2 mo. The shorter section had a higher enrollment and a higher attrition rate. A postcourse survey revealed that the majority of the students in the shorter course believed that they would have spent more time studying and would have received a better grade had they taken the longer class. Interestingly, in any one year, there was no significant difference between the mean final grades earned by students in the two sections and by males and females. All students who completed the longer section and the majority of students in the shorter section of the course stated that they would recommend the longer class to a friend who was committed to taking this online course.

AB Dobson JL. Effect of uniform versus expanding retrieval practice on the recall of physiology information. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 6-12, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00090.2011.-The purpose of this study was to compare the retention of selected physiology concepts throughout 30 days of two different uniform schedules of retrieval and two different expanding schedules of retrieval. Participants (n = 250) first read and reread 30 immunology and reproductive physiology concepts and were then repeatedly assessed, without feedback, according to one of the following four randomly assigned schedules: 1) immediately after learning and again 9 and 19 days later [uniform (days 1, 10, and 20)]; 2) 7, 14, and 21 days after learning [uniform (days 8, 15, and 22)]; 3) immediately after learning and again 5 and 15 days later [expanding (days 1, 6, and 16)]; and 4) 1, 6, and 16 days after learning [expanding (days 2, 7, and 17)]. All participants completed a final assessment 29 days after learning the physiology concepts. Mean final assessment scores +/- SE for the uniform (days 1, 10, and 20), uniform (days 8, 15, and 22), expanding (days 1, 6, and 16), and expanding (days 2, 7, and 17) groups were 36.15 +/- 1.97, 32.31 +/- 1.87, 45.80 +/- 2.56, and 39.71 +/- 2.48, respectively. There were no differences in final assessment scores between the two expanding retrieval groups, but expanding (days 1, 6, and 16) group scores were significantly higher than those in both uniform retrieval groups (ANOVA, F = 6.52, P = 0.00). Also, the combined mean of the two expanding retrieval conditions (42.57 +/- 1.80) was significantly higher (F = 14.09, P = 0.00) than the combined mean of the two uniform retrieval conditions (34.10 +/- 1.36). The results indicate that participants benefited more from expanding retrieval practice, particularly when the first assessment was administered immediately after learning.

AB Lin Y-H, Liang J-C, Tsai C-C. Effects of different forms of physiology instruction on the development of students' conceptions of and approaches to science learning. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 42-47, 2012; doi: 10.1152/advan.00118.2011.-The purpose of this study was to investigate students' conceptions of and approaches to learning science in two different forms: internet-assisted instruction and traditional (face-to-face only) instruction. The participants who took part in the study were 79 college students enrolled in a physiology class in north Taiwan. In all, 46 of the participants were from one class and 33 were from another class. Using a quasi-experimental research approach, the class of 46 students was assigned to be the "internet-assisted instruction group," whereas the class of 33 students was assigned to be the " traditional instruction group." The treatment consisted of a series of online inquiry activities. To explore the effects of different forms of instruction on students' conceptions of and approaches to learning science, two questionnaires were administered before and after the instruction: the Conceptions of Learning Science Questionnaire and the Approaches to Learning Science Questionnaire. Analysis of covariance results revealed that the students in the internet-assisted instruction group showed less agreement than the traditional instruction group in the less advanced conceptions of learning science (such as learning as memorizing and testing). In addition, the internet-assisted instruction group displayed significantly more agreement than the traditional instruction group in more sophisticated conceptions (such as learning as seeing in a new way). Moreover, the internet-assisted instruction group expressed more orientation toward the approaches of deep motive and deep strategy than the traditional instruction group. However, the students in the internet-assisted instruction group also showed more surface motive than the traditional instruction group did.

AB This is a memoir of my experiences in learning and teaching Physiology. It begins in 1962 when I entered the University of Washington as a medical student and began research in a physiology laboratory, which led to a Ph.D. degree in Physiology and Biophysics to go with my M.D. degree in 1968. At this time, both groups of students participated in the same physiology course containing both lectures and laboratories. After postdoctoral research at the NIH and in Cambridge, UK, in 1973 I joined the faculty of the Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco where I participated in the teaching of medical students and graduate students for nearly 15 years. By this time, the teaching of medical and graduate students had largely separated. In 1987, I moved to the University of Michigan as Professor and Chair of Physiology where my role in teaching was organizational as well as participatory for the next 35 years. In this work, I compare the teaching of medical students as well as graduate students and focus on how it has changed over this 60-year period. Over this time both medical and graduate Ph.D. education have become more integrative. Medical education is now taught in organ blocks rather than courses, and I participated in organizing the teaching of the gastrointestinal block. At Michigan, there is no longer a separate medical school class in Physiology, and graduate students enter a combined, "Program in Biomedical Science" for a year before choosing a mentor and department. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Teaching remains an important part of the career of academic physiologists. It is important for schools offering the Ph.D. to provide instruction and experience in teaching. The American Physiology Society has developed new programs to assist teachers and many universities have centers on learning and teaching.

AB Ninety-five percent of Westerners do not consume the recommended daily vegetable intake, exacerbating the incidence of obesity, malnutrition, and nutritional deficiencies such as fiber. This article reviews the literature from PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science, as well as Internet sites and government resources, to identify what should be considered important inclusions relating to dietary vegetable (including legumes and pulses) intake content in university physiology subjects. The primary aim is to advance the competency relating to good nutrition knowledge for future health professionals to enable them to guide and counsel patients and clients toward better health. A review of the literature provides scant nutritional content relating to vegetable intake, particularly across physiology subjects and health professional programs in general. A review of country dietary guidelines yielded discrepancies and ambiguity around recommended daily vegetable intake, including what constitutes essential vegetables. Educators responsible for embedding nutritional information in the curriculum would therefore be challenged to find reliable, evidence-based resources. Adding quality curriculum content on the importance of vegetable intake also promotes some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), thereby contributing to SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being). This article offers recommendations on how to embed content relating to the importance of dietary vegetables for good health and guidance for educators of health professions programs wanting to improve their curriculum content relating to adequate nutrition.

DE pandering to students; students as "customers"
ID MOTIVATION
AB Preclinical medical education has lost its way. In fact, it seems that preclinical medical education has forgotten its mission and has become focused on assembly line efficiency and profits. Administrators and students are increasingly considering preclinical medical education as a market with credentials (access to USMLE Step 1 or COMLEX Level 1) the commodity and students the consumers. Consider that, once banned, for-profit medical schools are on the rise in the United States. In response to these changes, medical schools are adopting corporate models, cutting costs, and seeking profit-making opportunities. One example is the broadcasting of content to multiple sites and satellite campuses. In addition, the customers need to feel satisfied with the educational experience bought for them at high tuition costs. However, providing students with what they want often happens at the expense of what they need, and administrators engage in subtle pandering to students. Furthermore, although the pursuit of credentials is understandable, a university is more than a factory that produces diplomas and careers. Universities exist to educate, discover, and impart knowledge while impacting our ways of living and thinking. In this context, universities exist for the greater good and betterment of societies. The "corporatization" of medical education and satisfying the customer creates an environment where a university is selling socioeconomic stability, professional status, and success, rather than a setting for the formation of character, intellect, and critical thinking. Our hope is that administrators, educators, and students will reconnect to the greater purpose and value of learning.

AB Consensus was reached on seven core concepts of physiology using the Delphi method, including "integration," outlined by the descriptor "cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems interact to create and sustain life." This core concept was unpacked by a team of 3 Australian physiology educators into hierarchical levels, identifying 5 themes and 10 subthemes, up to 1 level deep. The unpacked core concept was then circulated among 23 experienced physiology educators for comments and to rate both level of im-portance and level of difficulty for each theme and subtheme. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to compare between and within themes. The main theme (theme 1: the body is organized within a hierarchy of structures, from atoms to molecules, cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems) was almost universally rated as Essential. Interestingly, the main theme was also rated between Slightly Difficult to Not Difficult, which was significantly different from all other subthemes. There were two separate subsets of themes in relation to importance, with three themes rating between Essential and Important and the two other themes rating as Important. Two subsets in the difficulty of the main themes were also identified. While many core concepts can be taught concur-rently, Integration requires the application of prior knowledge, with the expectation that learners should be able to apply concepts from "cell-cell communication," "homeostasis," and "structure and function," before understanding the overall Integration core con-cept. As such, themes from the Integration core concept should be taught within the endmost semesters of a Physiology program. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article proposes the inclusion of a core concept regarding "integration" into physiology-based cur-ricula, with the descriptor "cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems interact to create and sustain life." This concept expands prior knowledge and applies physiological understanding to real-world scenarios and introduces contexts such as medications, diseases, and aging to the student learning experience. To comprehend the topics within the Integration core concept, students will need to apply learned material from earlier semesters.

AB Although previous studies have confirmed the various benefits of concept maps, limited information is available regarding how to effectively employ the concept map in online courses. In this research, we have designed and assessed the effectiveness of the "Zoom-sandwiched cross-chapter concept map" model in an online biology course. The model has optimized the concept map project because it incorporates synchronous interaction as well as asynchronous communication among students, assigns required meetings with flexible schedules, endows students with intrinsic motivation, and is facilitated by indirect instructor inter-vention. Our results showed improved student skills in constructing the cross-chapter concept map and positive student percep-tions of the model. In addition, this study provided an in-depth analysis of how students benefit from cross-chapter concept maps. Our findings could guide educators on how to optimize the concept map project and utilize concept maps effectively to overcome some primary learning challenges and enhance student learning in online education, especially in STEM fields.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research aims to optimize the concept map project for STEM courses in the virtual delivery system and to explore its effectiveness. Specifically, we 1) established the "Zoom-sandwiched cross-chapter concept map" model in an online STEM course; 2) evaluated student performance on concept map construction; 3) distributed survey questions to investi-gate student perception toward the Zoom-sandwiched cross-chapter concept map model; and 4) further explored the mecha-nism of how this model promoted student learning.

AB The current student body will, by and large, seek online resources to supplement their learning. However, resources that are freely available online vary in accuracy and quality, and the vast majority rely on passive learning. Therefore, there is a need for interactive physiology teaching resources that facilitate application of knowledge, that can be accessed by students in their own time. The aim of this study was to design a digital escape room on the topic of cardiac arrhythmias and to evaluate this resource as a consolidation exercise to support learning and enjoyment of physiology. The digital escape room was designed as a series of interactive puzzles and created with a website page builder on a freely accessible WordPress site. To facilitate engagement, the escape room incorporated a countdown timer. Second-year medical students were invited to play the digital escape room remotely as a group exercise after delivery of the relevant teaching. Evaluation of the resource took place quantitatively with Google Analytics and Tag Manager software and qualitatively with a questionnaire (Microsoft Forms). Quantitative evaluation suggested that the puzzles were created across a range of difficulties but that most groups were able to complete the exercise and remained engaged throughout. Student feedback suggests that the format of the resource was rated positively, and most participants felt that the game helped to consolidate and apply their knowledge of cardiovascular physiology. Future studies will focus on examining whether the cardiovascularthemed digital escape room improves knowledge attainment among students studying physiology in higher education. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article describes the design and development of a new, freely accessible cardiovascular-themed digital escape room. This web-based resource promotes active learning by facilitating problem-solving and application of physiology knowledge while working against a clock.

AB Mental health conditions can impact college students' academic achievements and experiences. As such, students may choose to disclose mental illnesses on medical school applications. Yet, no recent studies have investigated to what extent disclosure of a mental health condition may impact whether an applicant is accepted to medical school. We conducted an audit study to address this gap and surveyed 99 potential medical school admissions committee members from over 40 M.D.-granting schools in the United States. Participants rated a fictitious portion of a single medical school application on acceptability, competence, and likeability. They were randomly assigned to a condition: an application that explained a low semester grade-point average due to 1) a mental health condition, 2) a physical health condition, or 3) offered no explanation. After rating their respective application, all committee members were asked about when revealing a mental health condition would be beneficial and when it would be detrimental. Using ANOVAs, multinomial regression, and open coding, we found that medical school admissions committee members do not rate applications lower when a mental health condition is revealed. Committee members highlighted that revealing a mental health condition to demonstrate resiliency could be beneficial, but if the reference is vague or the condition is not being managed, it could be detrimental to a student's application. This work indicates that medical school admissions committee members do not exhibit a bias against mental health conditions and provides recommendations on how to discuss mental illness on medical school applications.

AB The mammalian cardiac conduction system (CCS) is a multifaceted continuum of electrically distinct, interconnected constructs within the myocardial mass. The key components are the sinus node (SAN), the atrioventricular node (AVN), the His bundle (HB), and the Purkinje fiber network (PF), the latter serendipitously discovered by Jan Evangelista Purkinje in 1839 in the sheep ventricle. In 1893, Wilhelm His, Jr. described a ventricular muscular tract conveying SAN-generated action potentials from the AVN (discovered by Sunao Tawara and Karl Albert Aschoff in 1906) to the PF. In 1906, Keith and Flack completed these explorations by localizing the SAN, the primum movens of CCS, which functions as a biologic oscillator emitting cadenced impulses that travel via the Bachmann bundle to the atrial myocytes and, via internodal pathways, to the AVN. Here these impulses are briefly delayed, enabling atrial systole before continuing via the AVN and the high-speed His-Purkinje conduction axis to signal ventricular contraction. The CCS canonical discoverers (Keith and Flack, Aschoff and Tawara, His, and Purkinje), historical controversies, fundamental notions of anatomy, physiology, and pathology, and therapeutic interventions pertaining to the CCS are the main themes of this review. Any scientist mentioned or unmentioned in this report who contributed directly or indirectly, with correct or inaccurate hypotheses, to the characterization of the CCS deserves our deepest gratitude for the long and painstaking hours spent microscopically scrutinizing heart specimens from multiple mammalian species, including humans.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This report presents the first comprehensive summary of the factors enabling the discovery of the cardiac conduction system (CCS). Biographical highlights and achievements of the CCS canonical discoverers, hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying sinus node (SAN) automaticity, use of eponyms to denominate a discovery, famous controversies, possible reproachable behavior (e.g., intellectual support for eugenics in post-World War I Germany) by two of the discoverers, and examples of historical mentor-pupil relationships are discussed.

ID ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION; LABORATORIES
AB The frog sciatic nerve provides a robust physiological preparation students may conveniently use to investigate the properties of compound action potentials. Electrical stimulation with standard physiology teaching equipment elicits compound action potentials that are easily recorded by upper-level undergraduate students. The amplitude of compound action potentials increases with greater stimulation voltages, up until a maximum response is achieved. Plotting action potential size as a function of stimulating voltage produces a curve that illustrates the responsiveness of a nerve. In the present study, several local anesthetics (MS-222, procaine, lidocaine, benzocaine, and tetracaine) were used to reversibly suppress compound action potentials within a time frame consistent with the limitations of teaching labs. Highly responsive nerves generate steep response curves that reach asymptotes at relatively low stimulating voltages. Less active nerves require higher stimulating voltages and appear "right-shifted." Anesthetized response curves may also appear "flatter," exhibiting lower peak amplitude, when compared to fully active nerves. The magnitude of action potential suppression and time course of recovery depended upon the specific anesthetic applied. Nerves anesthetized with MS-222 were the fastest to recover, reaching their original responsiveness within 20 min. Tetracaine had the most dramatic effects, with nerves typically requiring more than a day to fully recover physiological responses. Carefully dissected nerves maintained their physiological responses for many days when stored in Ringer solution at 4 degrees C, making this preparation particularly useful for undergraduate lab experiences. Quantitative analyses may be performed on the data collected, providing students with opportunities to design and implement their own experiments.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The frog sciatic nerve preparation represents a "classical" physiology lab for demonstrating principles of action potentials. Local anesthetics provide an inexpensive tool to manipulate the physiological activity of nerves and other excitable tissues. Isolated nerves retain their physiological activity for up to several days when kept in Ringer solution at 4 degrees C. Quantitative data analysis from this robust nerve preparation should present students with many opportunities for designing their own experiments with anesthetics.

AB A filler is any word or sound that interpolates (i.e., is inserted into) the main message of a speaker. Common fillers include "um", "ah," "like," "so," and "you know?" among others. Excessive use of fillers in scientific presentations can reduce the credibility of the speaker as well as impair the comprehension of the speaker's message by the audience. Primary causes of fillers include nervousness/speaking too quickly, inadequate preparation time, and infrequently used words that are difficult for the speaker to remember while presenting. Recommendations for reducing the use of fillers include self-awareness of the problem, reinforcing feedback, and active intervention to render pauses silent (instead of verbal) by "chunking" content, increasing preparation time, and slowing presentation pace. Excessive use of fillers is an obstacle to becoming an effective public speaker, and therefore, efforts to reduce filler use should be a goal of professional development.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although many articles exist on the use of filler words during public speaking, to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive discussion of the issue in the context of scientific presentations and speech in biomedical research. This Personal View discusses the problem of excessive filler use, the underlying causes, and tips for reducing fillers based on a combination of available literature and personal advice from a laboratory with nearly 40 years of experience in mentoring.

AB Medical education has seen a shift toward interactive teaching in small groups that actively involves students in learning. However, didactic teaching, despite drawbacks such as student isolation and low stimulation of critical thinking, is still a very commonly used teaching method. For didactic teaching to be effective, teachers must possess strategies and skills that enable them to teach effectively in large groups and increase students' knowledge retention. This can be achieved if class sessions are planned in advance with the aim of making them interactive and engaging with all students. In the following article, I write about my experiences using the CASCADE method, an acronym of the words "create," "assess," "sequence," "charisma," "activate," "discussion," and "e-device," which creates interactive didactic sessions.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic, while disruptive and abrupt, provided instructors opportunities to redesign face-to-face (F2F) lecture courses to an online asynchronous delivery mode. Asynchronous course delivery is often synonymous with recorded lectures, discussion boards, and standardized assessments, yet this mode can be student-centered, include active learning, and engage students. Our undergraduate clinical pathophysiology course was redesigned with Understanding Your Physiology (Lt by ADinstruments) lessons with video case studies in place of a textbook. Most students (72.7%) found the Lt activities effective in helping them learn the material as well as a cost-effective replacement for a traditional textbook (50%). In addition, the course design focused on different types of Lt activities to deliver the course content in an interactive way. Specifically, students (82%) appreciated the opportunity to select an answer without penalty and make another selection if needed. The type of activity that students selected as most effective in helping them learn and understand the content was the ability to determine which statements were correct/incorrect (32%). Students enjoyed the video case studies of patients because they were directly related to course content, were visually engaging, and used real patients who told their personal story. All these factors contributed to the success in achieving the study's goals of redesigning a F2F lecture course to an asynchronous online format. The online course led to verifiable pedagogical outcomes of using the Lt platform to engage students in learning. This course was offered again in 2021, filled quickly, and will continue to be offered each year.

AB To help educators deliver their physiology laboratory courses remotely, we developed an inexpensive, customizable hardware kit along with freely available teaching resources. We based the course design on four principles that should allow students to conduct insightful experiments on different physiological systems. First, the experimental setup should not be constrained to laboratory environments. Second, students should be able to take this course without prior coding and electronics experience. Third, the hardware kit should be relatively inexpensive, and all other resources should be freely available. Fourth, all resources should be customizable for educators. The hardware kit consists of commercially available electronic components, with a microcontroller as its hub (Arduino friendly). All measurement systems can be assembled without soldering. The hardware kit is cost-effective (approximately the cost of a textbook) and can be customized depending upon instructional needs. All software is freely available, and we share all necessary codes in open-access online repositories for simple use and customizability. All lab manuals and additional video tutorials are also freely available online and customizable. In our particular course, we have weekly asynchronous physiology lectures and one synchronous laboratory session, where students can get help with their equipment. In this article, we only focus on the novel and opensource laboratory part of the course. The laboratory includes four units [data acquisition, ECG, electromyography (EMG), activity classification] and one final project. It is our intent that these resources will allow other educators to rapidly implement their own remote physiology laboratories or to extend our work into other pedagogical applications of wearable technology.

AB Peer-assisted learning (PAL) is an educational method commonly applied in academic teaching. It is characterized by the interplay between peer teachers and learners who are at a similar academic level. Although it has been shown that peer teachers benefit from participating in PAL, little is known about their perception of motivation and rewards. Here we designed a questionnaire and measured the perception of intrinsic motivation and rewards of peer teachers from three different PAL programs. Overall, peer teachers were highly intrinsically motivated. The reward category Supporting Others was appreciated the most, followed by the reward categories Self-Improvement, Feedback, and Financial. The perception of rewards reflected the features of the three PAL programs. For example, the item "learning the teaching matter themselves" was most valued by peer teachers who were enrolled in a PAL program that deployed their peer teachers primarily to convey knowledge. In contrast, "actively shaping the teaching situation" was appreciated most by peer teachers of the PAL program that enables their peer teachers to conceive their teaching sessions independently. These findings go toward recommendations of the implementation and further development of PAL programs. If PAL programs clearly define their features and aims, they could specifically attract (and select) peer teachers and meet their needs as well as expectations, providing opportunities to gain knowledge and teaching experience. Ultimately, these PAL programs could better support the learners.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in the school learning system. Face-to-face learning shifted to remote learning using multimedia approaches. Online learning created particular difficulties for Physical Education (PE) teachers. Previously, they had to be role models in the teaching of physical activity. A national virtual workshop was conducted to support those teachers as they shift to remote learning. The purpose of the workshop was to provide PE instruction through social media and develop online learning modules. The 3 days of activities consisted of 4 lectures and 6 workshops provided to 177 PE teachers from 32 provinces in Indonesia. Participants were informed about the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on children, and healthy life during the pandemic. Online applications that were free of charge, easy to use, highly rated, and widely downloaded were also introduced to them. These multimedia applications could help teachers develop and deliver remote learning modules to their students. The workshop supported the teachers as they adapted to interactive distance learning. The workshop also successfully illustrates an innovative distance learning module delivered through multimedia.

   CLEARANCE; RISK; QUANTIFICATION
AB Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a key index of renal function. The classic method for assessing GFR is the clearance of inulin. Several current methods using isotopic (125I-iothalamate, 51Cr-EDTA, or 99Tc-DTPA) or nonisotopic (iohexol or iothalamate) markers are available. Clinically, GFR is estimated (eGFR) from serum creatinine or cystatin C levels. Estimated GFR based on creatinine and/or cystatin are less accurate than measured GFR. The creatinine-based equations calculate higher eGFR values (suggesting better kidney function) for black individuals. This upward adjustment for all black individuals is embedded in eGFR calculations on the belief of higher serum creatinine concentrations among black individuals than among white individuals. Thus "race-corrected" eGFR has become a widely accepted and scientifically valid procedure. However, race is not a genetic or biological category. Rather, race is a social construction defined by region-specific cultural and historical ideas. Furthermore, there is no accepted scientific method for classifying people as black or white individuals. Studies typically rely on self-identification of race. However, any person in the United States with any known black ancestry is considered to be a black individual. This is known as the "one-drop rule," meaning that a single drop of "black blood" makes anyone a black individual. It does not matter if an individual has 50%, 25%, 5%, or 0.5% African ancestry. The limited accuracy and reliability of this approach would not be allowed for any other scientific variable. Admixture and migration have produced such broad variations that race categories should not be used as experimental variables.
