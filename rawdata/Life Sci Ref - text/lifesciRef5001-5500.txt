DE Collaborative work; information literacy; online research skills
AB Community college science majors were assigned a team-based research project in a course sequence of General Biology I and II and were followed over a two-semester sequence during three academic years. The project was intended to introduce key General Education principles such as global citizenship, scientific reasoning, communication skills, information literacy, and stewardship. Conducted in partnership with library faculty, the assignment used course-integrated workshops and one-on-one reference instruction to help students produce research papers, learn the mechanics of online library research, and practice public speaking. Assignments were designed to emphasize and refine skills such as information literacy, critical thinking, and writing, while supplementing course content with current global events. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted to analyze assimilation of skills during General Biology I and mastering of those skills the following semester.

   autonomy; assignment choice
ID LEARNING-ENVIRONMENT; STUDENTS; PERCEPTIONS
AB Pedagogical practices such as active learning and group-based exercises are increasingly being used to engage students in course content during class meetings. However, techniques employed in class may not always contribute to engagement outside of the class meetings, or to student satisfaction with the course itself. Previous reports have shown that student autonomy and initial perceptions of the course setup influence their engagement and satisfaction, independent of the course context. To address engagement in an upper level collegiate biology class, students were allowed to choose their own assignments accounting for 50% of their total grade and also choose the due dates for those assignments; the remaining 50% came from exam scores. The goal was to allow students the option to pick assignments that best reflected their perceived strengths and preferences in order to determine whether these options increased students' satisfaction and engagement with the course content. Students were surveyed with questionnaires at the beginning and end of the semester to monitor their perception of the course setup, their interest in the course content, and their satisfaction with the course. Comparing initial perception of the course layout with final experiences, students reported that assignment choice did increase interest in the course and resulted in a student-reported increase in personal responsibility within the course.

AB Evolution is often challenging for high school students to understand because it encompasses an array of interlinked processes that occur across a broad swath of biological scales. To help address this, we have developed a set of freely accessible, online, and interactive lessons that focus on the evolution of sweet garden peas from their starchy tasting ancestors. Gregor Mendel first explored the genetics of garden peas in the mid-1800s; our materials help students explore the basis of the R and r alleles from genetic, protein, cell function, artificial selection, and population genetics perspectives. These Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-linked lessons integrate concepts across scales and are designed to be used in a flexible order, with support provided to teachers on how to choose a sequence that meets their students' needs. Throughout, students act as scientists as they uncover how multiple processes at disparate scales all worked together in the evolution of sweet and wrinkled peas from ancestors that were starchy and round.

AB The Eighth Day of Creation is a narrative history of molecular biology by science journalist Horace Freeland Judson. It uses first-person interviews to tell the story of how scientists in the mid-20th century discovered the basic rules of life that we now call the Central Dogma. The book presents both an in-depth analysis of the foundational research and a look into the lives of the scientists involved. We used this book as the primary text for an advanced undergraduate seminar course at the University of Washington in winter 2020, a class designed to help students critically think about approaches to science, the role of social factors in scientific progress, and the conceptual development of paradigm shifts. In this piece we reflect on our approach designing the course and our experience teaching it and share our syllabus (annotated with some reflections on the course) as inspiration for others

ID SCIENCE
AB Ecological field techniques such as transect surveys are long-used, integral means of immersing students in field exercises to illustrate ecological measures. Many species of crayfish create conspicuous burrows within or near aquatic habitats. Such burrows can easily be identified and measured by students during an ecological field exercise. In this article, we describe a field activity we developed as part of a college-level course in which students utilized transects and calipers to collect counts and measurements of crayfish burrows in order to evaluate their distribution and size among different substratum types along a small stream. This field exercise could be incorporated, with or without modification, into an applicable high school or introductory/intermediate college biology course as a means of illustrating ecological concepts, sampling technique, and/or behavioral biology.

AB Charles Darwin would be pleased to know that elementary school children in states that have adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are expected to demonstrate their understanding of several core evolutionary concepts, including trait variation and inheritance, fossils and extinct organisms, common ancestry, natural selection, and adaptation. However, he might also wonder how this is accomplished in the demanding 21st-century science curriculum. In files linked to this article, we provide four lesson plans - with engaging examples, natural selection games, and other interactive activities - that were designed to cover the NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas in evolutionary biology for grades 3-5, in two one-hour lessons. The lesson plans were developed by college students under the guidance of evolutionary biologists and in consultation with elementary school teachers, and then field tested in elementary school classrooms, as described in an accompanying research article.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article

ID GENETICISTS
AB Pedigree analysis has long been an essential tool in human genetics as well as a staple of genetics education. Students of genetics might be surprised to learn that human pedigrees were first popularized in the United States by proponents of eugenics, the pseudoscientific social movement aimed at improving the genetic quality of the human race. Notably, the influential eugenicist Charles B. Davenport employed pedigree charts to support his belief that not only were such medical conditions as Huntington disease and albinism inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion, but so too were such characteristics as alcoholism, criminality, and "feeblemindedness." We now see the flaws in Davenport's pedigree analysis, but at the time, it was the latest scientific advance. The misuse of pedigree analysis during the eugenics era may serve as a cautionary tale for those who are now harnessing the latest genetic technologies to solve complex problems.

TI Microbe Art Can Educate & Correct Misconceptions about Microorganisms

ID BACTERIAL; EVOLUTION
AB Microorganisms are diverse, minute, simple life forms that generally cannot be seen by the naked eye and require the use of a microscope to be visualized. They have a great impact on all other life forms. Their tiny size conceals them from us, engendering misunderstanding and fear due to the diseases caused by only a tiny minority of them. We conceptualized and installed an art exhibition called Tiny Enormous with the intent to educate our campus community and correct misconceptions about microorganisms. Tiny Enormous utilized a variety of artistic media, including paint, sculpture, video, and preserved plates, to display the diversity and ubiquity of microbes, and a series of infographics to illustrate key concepts and correct misconceptions. We surveyed visitors at the opening and closing receptions to examine their knowledge about, and perceptions and attitudes toward, microorganisms prior to and after visiting the exhibition. Respondents who had viewed Tiny Enormous demonstrated better knowledge of microbiological terms and concepts and self-reported increased knowledge about microorganisms compared to those who had not. Perceptions that microorganisms were harmful did not differ between subjects prior to and after visiting Tiny Enormous, possibly because of the exhibition's information about "superbugs." Our results suggest that artistic representations of microorganisms are effective educational tools for both academic and nonacademic audiences.

AB Field investigations represent an excellent opportunity to integrate the Next Generation Science Standards to complement and enhance both classroom and laboratory instruction. This inquiry-based exercise is designed to introduce students to the basic anatomy, ecology, and natural history of a common backyard denizen, the wolf spider (Lycosidae). Students are charged with developing one or more testable hypotheses regarding wolf spiders in their own backyards. Wolf spiders are an ideal subject for field investigation because their secondary eyes possess a highly reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum. At night, this layer produces an unmistakable "eyeshine" when viewed with the beam of a flashlight. Playing the role of students, we tested the hypothesis that wolf spiders should occur at higher density in an undeveloped field than in a typical backyard. To test this, we utilized random quadrat sampling in both habitats using flashlights to detect nocturnal eyeshine. Students obtaining similar results would likely have concluded that wolf spiders were more abundant in natural habitats.

DE Membrane potential; anions; modeling
AB In biological membranes that are permeable to water and ions but impermeable to other solutes, the diffusible ions cannot reach a concentration equilibrium. instead, a state of electroneutrality is achieved on each side of the membrane, which requires that the diffusible ions be found in different concentrations on either side of the membrane. The Donnan equilibrium is a major contributing factor to the polarized state of cells, and appreciating it is vital to the understanding of neuronal physiology. This article presents a nonmathematical active-learning exercise that will help AP and college biology students understand how the Donnan equilibrium is achieved.

AB Creating and interpreting visual displays of data is an important component of quantitative and scientific literacy. We examined a figure-analysis activity called "Figure of the Day" (FotD) and its impact on undergraduate biology students' figure creation skills. The treatment FotD activity required that students interpret a figure with some contextual information missing (e.g., titles, labels, legends). The control FotD activity required that students interpret a figure with no missing contextual information. Students in both the treatment and control groups made significant gains in their figure creation abilities. Bootstrapping of the Wilcoxon signed-rank effect sizes, r, shows large effect sizes for both the treatment (r +/- SE = 0.708 +/- 0.034) and control (r +/- SE = 0.688 +/- 0.0395) activities. Students most often reported that the activity's positive aspects were increases in their figure interpretation and creation skills. Commonly reported negative aspects of the activity were that it took too much time and the figures were confusing. Students in the treatment group more often reported that the activity was enjoyable. This suggests that regular interaction with figures in the style of the FotD activity can improve students' figure creation skills in a meaningful and enjoyable way.

AB Engaging students in hands-on inquiry helps them develop skills associated with the scientific process. Development of simple experiments using model caterpillars can provide an experiential demonstration of the scientific process and ecological principles for high school students. Caterpillar models are formed from plasticine, a nontoxic, nondrying modeling clay, and are an excellent tool for quantifying relative predation rates by birds, small mammals, and invertebrates. Lifelike surrogate larvae are glued to vegetation for short periods (one week) and retain identifiable maths (beak teeth, mandible imprints) following predator attack. This technique is simple, inexpensive, and provides rapid and clear results, rendering it a highly effective method of inquiry for high school students. Students can use these methods to ask a variety of research questions, such as comparison of predation in nearby habitats (path vs. backyard), vegetation (tree vs. shrub), season (spring vs. fall), or coloration (aposematic vs. camouflage). For many students, this may be one of few opportunities at the high school level to investigate science "in the field" and integrate scientific practices, such as the scientific method and inquiry, in an authentic research experience. Participants develop their scientific reasoning skills through creation of research questions and interpretation of results. They learn experimental technique, build field skills, and work collaboratively. This experiment aligns with the Next Generation Science Standards.

AB We present an instructional approach to incorporate into biology lessons an exchange of videos between international practicing scientists and secondary-school students. We validated the approach in German school settings in three curricular contexts: genetics, cell biology, and immunology. The participating students (n = 255) were native speakers of German with a background of English as a foreign language. The three participating scientists, English-speaking experts from the United Kingdom and Uganda, were rooted in different fields that were related to the respective curricular topics. We explain how the video exchange model was developed and evaluate students' comments and suggestions for improvement in a qualitative approach. This is followed by a discussion of implications for future applications. The video exchange was intended to promote English as the language of science in biology lessons. Through personal and genuine insight into science professions, students were able to experience the usefulness of English as a tool for international communication. We argue that the instructional model is applicable to a wide variety of educational contexts, including minority language students and native speakers of English.

ID DIVERSITY
AB This lab introduces students to experimental design in an inquiry lab exercise that investigates the gut microbiome, basic microbiology techniques, and the broader topic of bacteriology. Fruit flies are used as a model system to study the impact that foods, food additives, and/or antibiotics have on the gut microbiome. One of the major bacteria in the guts of fruit flies is Lactobacillus, which is easy to grow in the lab. This exercise is done in three consecutive lab sessions. During Lab 1, students prepare a standard nutritive medium that has been mixed with a substance of their choice, add the fruit flies to the medium, and practice serial dilution with a simulation. During Lab 2, students plate mashed fruit flies on MRS medium to look at the change in Lactobacillus levels. During Lab 3, students count and determine the change in the number of Lactobacillus in their tested substance, Gram stain selected colonies, and discuss their results as a class. SALG surveys indicated a significant gain in their understanding of the microbiology concepts introduced in this lab.

AB Students tend to be very interested in medical issues that affect them and their friends and family. Using cancer as a hook, the ART of Reproductive Medicine: Oncofertility curriculum (free, online, and NIH sponsored) has been developed to supplement the teaching of basic biological concepts and to connect biology and biomedical research. This approach allows integration of up-to-date information on cancer and cancer treatment, cell division, male and female reproductive anatomy and physiology, cryopreservation, fertility preservation, stem cells, ethics, and epigenetics into an existing biology curriculum. Many of the topics covered in the curriculum relate to other scientific disciplines, such as the latest developments in stem cell research including tissue bioengineering and gene therapy for inherited mitochondrial disease, how epigenetics occurs chemically to affect gene expression or suppression and how it can be passed down through the generations, and the variety of biomedical careers students could pursue. The labs are designed to be open-ended and inquiry-based, and extensions to the experiments are provided so that students can explore questions further. Case studies and ethical dilemmas are provided to encourage thoughtful discussion. In addition, each chapter of the curriculum includes links to scientific papers, additional resources on each topic, and NGSS alignment.

AB Reversible binding between biomolecules-for example, between a cell-surface receptor such as the insulin receptor and its corresponding natural ligand such as insulin-is central to innumerable physiological transactions. Binding of the dye HABA to egg-white avidin is a simple, reliable, and colorful laboratory model for introducing beginning biology students to the principles underlying reversible binding. They can probe the reaction quantitatively with a spectrophotometer, and model it mathematically using only high-school algebra and a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.

AB The use of primary scientific inquiry and experimentation to develop students' understanding of methodologies used by scientists and the nature of science is a key component of the Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Introduction to inquiry-based experimentation also has been shown to improve students' attitudes and interest in science. However, implementing scientific inquiry activities that include experimental design and data analysis in a classroom of middle or high school students can be daunting for teachers with limited experimental experience. Here, we present a four-to five-day, inquiry-based laboratory activity designed to teach students about the scientific process and excite them about scientific discovery while providing opportunities for interactions of both teachers and students with scientists in the field. Within this laboratory module, students make observations and develop their own research questions, then design, execute, analyze, and present the results of their hypothesis-driven experiments investigating the behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans, a relatively inexpensive and tractable model organism. Our experience running this module in a middle school biology classroom suggests students enjoyed the opportunity to investigate their own research questions, and post-course surveys indicated that students' fear of biology decreased and their interest in biology-related careers increased following participation in the module.

ID WINOGRADSKY COLUMN; INSTRUCTION
AB Self-sustaining ecosystem microcosms, called ecosystem jars, can easily be collected from local ponds, streams, or lakes. Sealed and exposed to sunlight, these miniature ecosystems can sustain themselves for a decade or more. Unlike Winogradsky columns, ecosystem jars are optimized for protist, animal, and plant observations and experiments, and are not altered by addition of sulfur, carbon, or cellulose sources, more accurately representing natural ecosystems. Ecosystem jars can support a variety of inquiry-based experiments, including student-designed projects, from middle school to college levels. Students, with instructor assistance, formulate hypotheses, design experiments, observe and catalog organisms by microscopy, then record their data in tables and graphs and draw conclusions. Students present their data in a paper or poster format or as oral presentations to the class. Potential experiments include examining biotic changes over time, the effects of added pollutants or nutrients, biotic differences between watershed types, or seasonal changes in biota. These investigations not only provide students with cooperative learning, inquiry-based lab experiences, but also help them gain appreciation for the effects of pollution or nutrient runoff on ecosystems.

AB It is essential that undergraduate biology majors are made aware of and receive guidance on career possibilities. The authors, who actively advise and teach biology majors (and future majors) at both the high school and undergraduate levels, collaborated to identify resources and methods to advise biology majors about their career choices. Multiple resources were identified. Current advising theory recommends a method of supporting students to make wise choices by considering personal vision, the kinds of professional successes desired, and individual talent development. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Census Bureau, and National Science Foundation data were analyzed to identify potential jobs that biology majors can attain. These resources and strategies should help faculty advisors and instructors inform biology majors about possible career paths.

AB Many recommendations for improving teaching are valid and important but may be prohibitively challenging for instructors. I describe 10 teaching techniques - "tweaks" - that are more easily implemented, and evidence of their value for increasing student engagement and learning: (1) Have a class outline visible at all times. (2) Use hand-written PowerPoint slides. (3) Help your students encode and review more complete notes. (4) Use in-class exercises that require commitment. (5) Incorporate "transfer" questions. (6) Focus on misconceptions. (7) Include photos that inspire and provoke. (8) Create the right test and teach to it. (9) Incorporate self-disclosure. (10) Reinforce the "take-home messages."

   in a Nonmajors Biology Course

   Change; Understanding by Design
ID SCIENCE
AB Instructors in two- and four-year undergraduate institutions face a variety of challenges in designing and delivering high-quality courses for their students and in creating accurate assessments of student learning. Traditional course planning (a linear, start-to-finish process based on the knowledge and perspective of the instructor) can lead to lack of clarity of learning objectives for students, uncertainty about course priorities for both instructor and students, and poor alignment between course material and assessments. To address these issues, Understanding by Design (UbD), a course-planning protocol widely used in K-12 education, was implemented to redesign a one-semester, nonmajors "Sensation & Perception" course at a four-year liberal arts college. This implementation improved the instructor's understanding of desired student learning outcomes, allowed core concepts and science competencies to be prioritized as recommended by the "Vision and Change" reform initiative, and led to decreased lecture time in favor of greater lab and student-driven discussion time. In addition, this process allowed components of evidence-based reasoning and scientific process to be incorporated authentically into assessments. Despite the increasing rigor of assessments, there was a statistically significant increase in students earning an A or B on the final exam after UbD implementation.

TI Active Learning in the Undergraduate Classroom: A Journal-Club
   Experience Designed to Accentuate Course Content
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Active learning; journal club; discussion-based teaching
AB Students in the natural sciences should be prepared as undergraduates to read and apply concepts from the scientific literature. I describe a strategy that enforced the necessity to deliver high volumes of content while incorporating an active-learning technique. Students were assigned to read and discuss articles from the scientific literature that complemented content being delivered via traditional lecture. Students were encouraged to participate by coming to class prepared with written questions, and discussion was directed by instructor-prepared prompts. Students were assessed via low-stakes assignments based primarily on participation. This teaching method has proved effective, as verbally reported by past students who are currently enrolled in graduate programs. These students report feeling more prepared than their peers to discuss and learn from the scientific literature.

AB A useful approach to answering the Next Generation Science Standards' call for teaching students to demonstrate understanding using mathematical representations is use of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (H-W eq). This article is focused on the meaning of H-W eq and its application, rather than mathematical manipulation. Typical textbook problems are critiqued, and a model problem is presented.

TI No Data Required: Why Intelligent Design Is Not Science
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Evolution; Intelligent Design; Creationism; science; content analysis;
   data; argue; Discovery Institute; science education; strengths and
   weaknesses; hypothesis
AB Intelligent Design (ID) proposes that biological species were created by an intelligent Designer, and not by evolution. ID's proponents insist that it is as valid a theory of how biological organisms and species came into existence as evolution by natural selection. They insist, therefore, that ID be taught as science in public schools. These claims were defeated in the Kitzmiller case. However, ID's proponents are still influential and cannot be considered a spent force. The question addressed here is whether ID's claim of scientific legitimacy is reinforced by quantified results. That is, do they have any data, or do they just argue? The ID articles that I analyzed claimed to present real science, but they rarely referred to data and never tested a hypothesis. Argumentation, however, was frequent. By contrast, peer-reviewed articles by evolutionary biologists rarely argued but referred frequently to data. The results were statistically significant. These findings negate claims by ID proponents that their articles report rigorous scientific research. Teachers will find this article helpful in defending evolution, distinguishing science from non-science, and discussing the weaknesses of ID.

LA English
DT Article
DE Nature of Science; evolution; inquiry; hypothesis; pseudoscience;
   Mystery Tube
AB I modified the classic Mystery Tube activity to teach not only the nature of science but also the nature of what is not science. In order for evidence and logic to be effective tools for teaching evolution, instructors may first benefit from giving students a tangible reason to set aside any prior nonscientific ideas they bring to the classroom. This activity helps instructors intentionally delineate scientific from nonscientific hypotheses, providing a clear and logical reason for teaching evolutionary theory, but not metaphysical ideas, in the science classroom.

AB Collaboration between two biologists and a physicist resulted in the example of tattooing being used as a motivator to support discussion across several scientific fields (cell biology, microbiology, human health, and physics). Although often viewed as self-destructive and rebellious in the Western world, tattooing has a deep and rich history full of meaning, for example as a rite of passage. Our main objective was to use a culturally relevant topic as a way to increase student engagement and learning while linking biological phenomena and physics. We describe this experience and provide a brief background on how the art and history of tattooing can aid in teaching young biologists.

AB We examine the interdisciplinary nature of ethnobotany from a broad perspective and consider its application to the biology classroom and lab. The concept of biophilia and students' relationships with plants are integral components. Botanical nature journaling, discussion of diverse cultural practices, and collection of plants are used to encourage students' interest in local plants. Interwoven with these topics is a plant/microbial lab, which focuses on the local environment and the potential antimicrobial properties of plant parts.

TI STEM Summer Camp for Girls Positively Affects Self-Efficacy

AB Women and racially and ethnically minoritized populations are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Out-of-school time programs like summer camps can provide positive science experiences that may increase self-efficacy and awareness of STEM opportunities. Such programs often use the same high-impact practices used in K-12 classrooms including relating concepts to real-world examples, engaging students as active participants in inquiry-driven projects, and facilitating learning in a cooperative context. They additionally provide opportunities for engaging in STEM without fear of failure, offer a community of mentors, and allow families to become more involved. We designed a summer camp for middle schoolers who identified as girls, low-income, and as a minoritized race or ethnicity. We describe the design of the camp as well as the results from a simple pre- and post-camp questionnaire that examined each camper's relationship to science, scientific self-efficacy, and interest in having a job in STEM. We found an increase in self-efficacy in camp participants, which is important because high scientific self-efficacy predicts student performance and persistence in STEM, especially for girls. We did not detect an increase in interest in pursuing a STEM job, likely because of already high values for this question on the pre-camp survey. We add to the growing body of work recognizing the potential of out-of-school time STEM programs to increase scientific self-efficacy for girls and racially minoritized students.
   Tweet: Summer camp for minoritized middle-school girls increases scientific self-efficacy, a characteristic that may be important for removing barriers to participation in STEM.

AB Currently, the world needs health-literate citizens who are able to make informed decisions about COVID-19 and other diseases. Here, we propose a COVID-19 roadmap consisting of four commented maps about infection, diagnosis, defense, treatment, and prevention. We built the maps based on those from the Atlas of Science Literacy following a qualitative methodology. Main ideas about health linked to COVID-19 and how they relate to each other can be visualized in the maps in an organized structure and according to K-levels. The maps are accompanied by a text that relates the health ideas to the COVID-19 disease. This tool can be used to promote health education and, ultimately, health literacy through the teaching and learning of COVID-19.

AB The worldwide scientific community has been promoting science communication from colleges and universities to schools, and different tools for communicating scientific discoveries have been created. Among this variety of tools, our choice fell on a storybook. The book, entitled The Curious Case of Ants That Live in Galls, is directed at 8-to-12-year-old children, and its use is suggested for literature and science classes. We propose either reading the text with the students or individual reading, followed by a debate and retextualization exercise. Also, the teacher can use the story as a motivation to address the science content and to discuss the scientific method. We observed the emergence of new questions, teaching methodologies, and didactic resources capable of amplifying the scientific context and, consequently, the student's motivation.

ID SCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; ACCEPTANCE
AB In instructional settings, evolution and natural selection are challenging concepts to teach, due to the fact that these topics are difficult to observe in the laboratory or lecture hall. In the past few years, Avida-ED has emerged as an innovative tool for teaching evolutionary principles. It allows students to directly observe effects of evolution by changing different variables, such as environmental conditions and genetic sequences. In our study, we used pretest and posttest questionnaires to investigate the use of Avida-ED in undergraduate coursework. We showed that students demonstrated similar improvement in evolutionary understanding irrespective of major, undergraduate level, sex, or final end-of-course grade. These results reinforce the idea that Avida-ED can facilitate learning of evolution in all student populations.

However, genetics is difficult to learn; known issues include its abstract nature, different scales, and technical language. Pedigree analysis is a convergence of these concepts, requiring use of multiple symbolic scales and understanding the relationships and nature of alleles, genes, and chromosomes. To measure student understanding of these concepts, as well as support biology educational reform toward student-centered instruction, we developed a formative assessment to provide reliable and valid evidence of student understanding, learning, and misconceptions for pedigree analysis. Nine multiple choice items targeted to four learning objectives were developed in an iterative process with faculty and student input. We designed distractor answers to capture common student misconceptions and deployed a novel statistical technique to assess the congruence of distractor language with targeted misconceptions. Psychometric analysis showed the instrument provides valid and reliable data and has utility to measure normalized learning gains. Finally, we employed cross-tabulation and distractor progression to identify several stable misconceptions that can be targeted for instructional intervention.

AB The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) were proposed in 2013 in the United States for K-12 learning to emphasize the importance of science and engineering practices in the three dimensions of science learning. In this study, we show that DNA extraction experiments, which are familiar in the United States, can be used not only as demonstration experiments but also as educational material for science practices. We could visualize extracted DNA using an enzyme treatment with DNase and RNase and agarose gel electrophoresis. We conducted a science practice in which a DNA extraction experiment was used as an extracurricular club activity in Japan. The students made predictions, conducted experiments, obtained results, and reflected on their findings. Although there are still points needing improvement, our results indicate that the DNA extraction experiment can be used as a new teaching material for NGSS science practices.

AB Creating a model and foldable to represent the cell cycle encourages higher-level thinking and promotes differentiated learning. Such activities provide additional "hands-on" means to reinforce teacher-led learning of the cell cycle, allowing project-based learning activities to help students visualize the cell cycle process and reflect on its significance. This activity is compatible with universal design for learning. This article describes project implementation, preactivity questions, materials needed, and postactivity reflection. Students may work on this activity online or in person, as the activity requires inexpensive commonly found materials. Students work at their own pace and abilities, as teachers guide them through the concepts, clarify confusion, and enrich their learning.

AB We present material and instructions to teach the construction of phylogenetic trees using specifically designed images of dragons. Using fictional creatures, we can control the number and properties of characteristics, as well as present students with a context they might consider interesting. Besides creating evolutionary trees from data, students can learn that trees based on morphological characteristics might contradict and trees based on genetic analysis are a more reliable tool in classification. The material used in this learning environment is freely available, so educators can use and customize it freely.
   Students working with this material declared a high motivation to work with the fictional animals and engaged in very active discussions about different classifications of the dragons.

DE homeostasis; science education; laboratory exercises
AB To survive, complex organisms must maintain homeostasis by coordinating the activity of interacting, hierarchical systems. This is a core biological idea in the Next Generation Science Standards and one that many students find challenging. The most common lab exercise used to introduce homeostasis - a mini-experiment in which students measure how physical activity affects their pulse and respiratory rate - fails to show any direct evidence of internal stability. In this article, we describe how modifying this lab using an inexpensive pulse oximeter rectifies this shortcoming, giving students the ability to collect laboratory data that show both change and dynamic stability.

AB Understanding the causes and consequences of variation among populations is fundamental for understanding the process of evolution via natural selection. To support students in noticing, questioning, and investigating variation in wild populations, we describe an introductory investigation that used digitized museum plant specimens as the primary focus. The activity illustrates how digitized museum collections can be used to introduce natural phenomena into the classroom, even without physical access to a museum. Through measuring plant specimens and examining patterns in data, students had opportunities to discuss how to obtain accurate measurements, handle noisy data, and request data that would be helpful for further investigation of the patterns they observed. In our example, we focused on one flowering plant, the royal penstemon (Penstemon speciosus), which varies in size across environmental gradients: larger plants are found at lower elevations, and smaller ones on the highest peaks, a pattern commonly observed in nature. Overall, this lesson led students to observe this pattern and wonder about the environmental constraints affecting phenotypes. We provide examples of the kinds of activities that could follow our lesson to provide students with opportunities to connect their ideas to intraspecific variation, a key component for understanding evolutionary processes.

AB We describe a series of three experiments in which students develop a model system for measuring the LC50 of household substances, using grass seed as the model organism. Students use statistical methods to compare two samples (using chi-square and Student's t-tests), conduct a two-level multifactor experiment to look at multiple factors simultaneously and observe interactions, and make serial dilutions to measure the LC50 over a threefold concentration range. The experimental series was very inexpensive to run and tended to provide very successful LC50 measurements.

AB Students need support to learn the core ideas, practices, and crosscutting concepts that make up the field of biology so that they can both be successful as biologists and make informed decisions that require biological understanding. One way instructors can support students in these endeavors is to provide students with specific scaffolds the instructors design to structure students' performance on a task or engagement in a behavior. With the focus on both scientific concepts and practices, instructors may also need support to be able to develop scaffolds that align with suggested best practices. I offer a framework, referred to as FRAMER, and suggestions for instructors interested in developing scaffolds for biology courses, and provide an example of a successful scaffold implementation in an undergraduate biology course.

AB Thermal imagery provides new opportunities to study concepts and processes in biology. Examples include using infrared (IR) cameras in educational activities to explore energy transfer and transformation in human physiology, animal thermoregulation, and plant metabolism. The user-friendly and visually intuitive nature of IR technology is well suited to the study of rapidly changing temperatures on biological surfaces, due to such energy transfers. IR cameras are therefore potentially helpful pedagogical tools for approaching the Energy and Matter crosscutting concept in the Life Sciences discipline of the Next Generation Science Standards.

DT Article
DE Antibody; antigen; disease incidence; enzyme; immunoassay; immunoblot;

AB In this exercise students use a simplified version of an immunoassay that relies on the nonspecific binding of proteins to nitrocellulose followed by the specific binding of antibodies to antigen. This antigen-antibody interaction is detected when a chromogenic substrate, catalyzed by the enzyme conjugated to the antibody, produces a color change. The immunoblot is less expensive and faster to perform than plastic-plate-based assays. I have used this assay for over 10 years in undergraduate courses: in ecology to estimate disease incidence; in botany to explore immunological techniques; and in biotechnology as an exercise in product development.

ID TAR-SPOT; NORWAY MAPLE
AB Symbioses can range from mutualisms to parasitisms; the latter are the foci of this exercise. The way in which parasites are distributed among hosts (their dispersion) can have profound importance for how they and their hosts coevolve, and for many other facets of their biology. Accordingly, many researchers, including ecologists and medical practitioners, study dispersion of parasites in detail. Fungi are commonly observed parasites on leaves of trees. I describe one way to randomly sample leaves to quantify dispersion of such parasites and test whether dispersion is related to a variety of explanatory variables. Significant quantities of data can be generated in relatively short order and pooled for a class; many patterns can emerge that challenge students to find logical interpretations. Relatively sophisticated students could test whether parasites have a random dispersion pattern by comparing the histogram they generate to that of a Poisson distribution. Data can be analyzed in a simple fashion or via advanced mixed models.

ID MATHEMATICS; SCIENCE
AB We present a novel laboratory activity to introduce students to experimental approaches often used by biologists to study orientation in animals. We first provide an overview of the current understanding of magnetoreception - the ability of some organisms to sense magnetic fields. We then outline an exercise that uses common pill bugs (Armadillidium vulgare) to examine whether a pulsed magnetic field affects their directional preference. The first part of the experiment includes the construction and visual testing of a pulse magnetizer built using low-cost and easily obtainable materials. Afterward, students examine the orientation of pill bugs both before and after being subjected to a magnetic pulse. Finally, students analyze their results with circular statistics using the open-source R coding platform, providing them experience in coding languages and statistical analysis. The interdisciplinary and biophysical nature of this experiment engages students in concepts of electromagnetic induction, magnetism, animal behavior, and statistics.

   misconceptions
AB Throughout global history, various infectious diseases have emerged as particularly relevant within an era. Some examples include the Bubonic plague of the fourteenth century, the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918, the HIV epidemic of the 1980s, and the Zika virus outbreak in 2015-16. These instances of emerging infectious disease represent ideal opportunities for timely, relevant instruction in natural and health science courses through case studies. Such instructional approaches can promote student engagement in the material and encourage application and higher-order thinking. We describe here how the case study approach was utilized to teach students about emerging infectious diseases using the 2014-16 Ebola virus outbreak as the subject of instruction. Results suggest that students completing the case study not only had positive perceptions of the mode of instruction, but also realized learning gains and misconception resolution. These outcomes support the efficacy of case pedagogy as a useful teaching tool in emerging infectious diseases, and augment the paucity of literature examining Ebola virus knowledge and misconceptions among undergraduate students within United States institutions.

ID SCIENCE
AB It is commonly said that perception is everything. Political candidates are judged by how the public understands their platforms; consumers make purchases based on how they view the products; and business executives make corporate decisions based on potential outcomes of business deals. Likewise, a person's preconception of a topic can change how they learn about and associate that knowledge. Topics with a shared vocabulary between science and common language, such as the terms used when teaching evolution and phylogenetic trees, are especially subject to misconceptions stemming from a lack of understanding how the terminology is used in science. One way to assess the preconceptions students have about specific topics is through using free association techniques. Free association word recall (word association) activities ask students to recall words and phrases associated with stimulus term. Educators can use student responses to learn how students understand and organize prior knowledge, and thus structure subsequent instruction activities to target the revealed preconceptions of the topic.

DE critical thinking; group assignment; introductory biology
AB In this study, we examined two types of group presentation assignments for use in a large, introductory biology course. Students were placed into groups of 6 to 8 members, and tasked with researching a topic and preparing a 10-minute inclass presentation. The assignments varied by course section; in the control section, each group's topics were selected to complement the course topic, whereas in the iterative sections, each group's topic would derive from the previous group's presentation. Students' critical thinking skills were assessed before and after the semester's presentations, and exit surveys were conducted. Results show that students in the iterative group performed better than control on exam questions, and overall interest in biology was high in both groups as a result of the presentations. Overall, performing group presentations in an iterative style enhanced learning by mimicking the scientific process of inquiry and discovery.

ID SCIENCE
AB Efforts to reform science education focus on implementing constructivist pedagogy to engage students in scientific practices, promote critical thinking, and provide students with relevant research experiences. In this spirit, this article presents authentic, inquiry-based activities utilizing the real-world bioscience behind wastewater treatment. The activities begin with a tour of a wastewater treatment facility, followed by a guided inquiry activity in which students enumerate E. coli levels from wastewater samples collected from different steps of the treatment process. Students then participate in an open-inquiry experiment to test a unique hypothesis. Learning about wastewater treatment introduces students to important biology content such as bioremediation, microbiology, and nutrient cycling. Additionally, students engage in science practices such as inquiry and constructing evidence-based explanations.

ID INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH; STUDENTS; ATTITUDES; SCIENCE; GARDEN
AB Students need to be aware of plants in order to learn about, appreciate, care for, and protect them. However, research has found that many children are not aware of the plants in their environment. A way to address this issue might be integration of plants with various disciplines. I investigated the effectiveness of an instructional approach based on integration of botany with chemistry and art for increasing students' awareness of plants. The study was carried out in a science summer school for 10- to 12-year- old students (n = 25). A plant awareness questionnaire and a plant blindness test were used as pretests and posttests to assess the effects of the instruction on the students' plant awareness. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with the students after instruction. The results indicated that integrating plants with various disciplines might overcome the learning problem of students associated with their "plant blindness." Moreover, this instructional approach can provide students opportunities to learn the names of plants and some concepts in the botanical discipline, as well as help them understand the relationship between plants and other disciplines.

AB Science educators often teach topics that are largely resolved in the scientific community yet remain controversial in broader society. In such cases, students may perceive the teacher as biased. We present two exercises that foster more objective learning about the scientific underpinnings of socially controversial topics. The first exercise clarifies why the scientific resolution of an issue does not necessarily align with social perception. The second applies this concept by having students discriminate science-based claims from other claims.

   inquiry-based learning; experiential learning
ID IMPACTS
AB Ocean acidification, a product of CO2 absorption by the world's oceans, is largely driven by the anthropogenic combustion of fossil fuels and has already lowered the pH of marine ecosystems. Organisms with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons are especially susceptible to increasing environmental acidity due to reduction in the saturation state of CaCO3 that accompanies ocean acidification. Creating a connection between human-mediated changes to our environment and the effect it will have on biota is crucial to establishing an understanding of the potential effects of global climate change. We outline two low-cost laboratory experiments that eloquently mimic the biochemical process of ocean acidification on two time-scales, providing educators with hands-on, hypothesis-driven experiments that can easily be conducted in middle and high school biology or environmental science courses.

AB Project-based learning and action research are powerful pedagogies in improving science education. We implemented a semester-long course using project-based action research to help students apply biotechnology knowledge learned in the classroom to the real world. Students had several choices to make in the project: working individually or as a team, selecting a topic of interest, and targeting a local community group. To enhance teachers' abilities to lead students through action projects, we describe the framework, provide class data, and discuss benefits and challenges encountered. This course could serve as a model of how project-based action research can benefit student learning in biotechnology.

AB Recent reform initiatives in undergraduate biology call for curricula that prepare students for dealing with real-world issues and making important links between science and society. In response to this call, we have developed an issues-based laboratory module that uses guided inquiry to integrate the concepts of animal behavior and population biology into an issue of both local and global relevance. The issue associated with this module is "What should be done about invasive crayfish?" Students investigate plausible reasons why crayfish are often successful invasive species through hypothesis testing, collection of behavioral data on live crayfish, and quantitative reasoning. Students also consider economic and environmental impacts of invasive species on local and global ecosystems. We implemented this module in a large introductory biology course and conducted survey research to evaluate the module's potential to serve as an interesting and valuable learning experience for undergraduate biology students.

AB A collaborative effort between a junior high school and a nearby university allowed 40 eighth-grade honors students to engage in a scientific investigation within a university laboratory. These students, with their science teachers and university researchers, gathered data on egg cannibalism in a beach-spawning fish and thereby contributed to an ongoing research project. Our objectives were to provide a scientific learning experience for the students and introduce them to a college setting. A survey, given 2.5 years after the investigation, found that most of the students had increased their interest in studying science in college.

AB This exercise demonstrates the principle of parsimony in constructing cladograms. Although it is designed using mammalian cranial characters, the activity could be adapted for characters from any group of organisms. Students score categorical traits on skulls and record the data in a spreadsheet. Using the Mesquite software package, students generate arbitrary cladograms and measure tree length. They then move taxa around to reduce tree length. The exercise can become competitive when students report out on tree lengths and try to achieve shorter trees than their peers. The resulting cladograms can be compared with a published mammalian phylogeny. The exercise illustrates phylogenetics, the principle of parsimony, and hypothesis testing using morphological data.

AB Because of shrinking budgets and computerized virtual dissection programs, many large and small institutions are closing the door on traditional and expensive cadaver dissection classes. However, many health-care educators would argue there is still a place for cadaver dissection in higher education, so the continuing challenge is to provide the undergraduate, pre-allied health-care student with dissection experience as budgetary constraints lead institutions away from this valuable and time-honored teaching tool. I present a teaching model that looks to address those concerns and is taught in a unique way, with minimal overhead and with the potential to provide an effective and rewarding experience for students entering the medical, nursing, and physical rehabilitation fields.

AB Oscar Riddle, born in Indiana in 1877, was an ardent evolutionist and a key player in the founding of the National Association of Biology Teachers in 1938. He studied heredity and behavior in domestic pigeons and doves with Charles O. Whitman of the University of Chicago, received his Ph.D. in zoology in 1907, and in 1912 began a long career at the Carnegie Institution. He is best known for his 1932 discovery of prolactin, the "mother love" hormone. Whitman founded and directed the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole and cared for Martha, the world's last passenger pigeon, who died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.

AB Most teachers agree that writing is an important skill for students to master, yet not all teachers incorporate writing assignments in their courses. Employers agree that written communication is important for college graduates, yet in a survey, less than 10% of employers thought that colleges did a good job preparing students for work. Writing an animal species account for Animal Diversity Web (http://animaldiversity.org) provides students with a real-world example of writing skills and provides resources to instructors who want to incorporate writing in their classes.

AB "What is life?" This deceptively simple question lies at the heart of biology. In this activity, students work in groups to come up with their own definition using a set of prompting cards that differs for each team. In doing so, students gain an appreciation of the complexities of addressing this question. The activity takes approximately 60-90 minutes to complete, but students often discuss its implications for weeks afterward. This activity successfully engaged freshman undergraduate students and could easily be adapted to high school and even elementary school students.

AB Since 1968, biologists have known that termites line up and follow some ballpoint ink lines but not others. Suggestions for class lessons based on this observation have become widespread. However, many of these are incomplete, superficial, conflicting, and/or occasionally inaccurate, and most provide only simple demonstrations or cookbook-style confirmations. Here, we provide added background for this activity to update, clarify, and expand it. Some ways to use termite trail-following to teach fundamental life and physical science concepts through hands-on inquiry are presented, based on our experience with university students and teachers. These activities, adaptable to many instructional levels, range in scope from a single laboratory session to extended investigation.

DE Environmental; microbiology; research; inquiry; collaboration
AB An undergraduate environmental microbiology course was used to examine the hypothesis that students could best grow as biologists, inform career decisions, and experience the scientific process by engaging in a collaborative, research-based laboratory format. Students learned how to use scientific literature to formulate relevant questions and hypotheses and develop detailed experimental research proposals. They collected, analyzed, interpreted, and presented original scientific data in the form of a research-poster conference. Course objectives were measured using two Likert-style surveys, and the resulting data supported the original hypothesis of this work.

AB The national Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Education Initiative favors a curriculum shift from the compartmentalization of math and science classes into discrete subject areas to an integrated, multidisciplinary experience. Many states are currently implementing programs in high schools that provide greater integration of math, sciences, and technology. Program evaluation results indicate that students participating in multidisciplinary team projects of this type exhibit significantly higher levels of motivation and develop greater cognitive skills than students in the traditional, compartmentalized curriculum (Ross & Hogaboam-Gray, 1988; Venville et al., 2000).

AB We developed an advanced, year-long course sequence in eukaryotic cell and molecular biology in order to increase conceptual understanding. Three years of historical data from a one semester, traditional-lecture, senior cell and molecular biology course (n = 237) were compared with 3 years of data collected from the year-long course sequence (n = 176). There were significant content gains for the students who enrolled in the course sequence when pre- and post-assessments were compared (p < 0.0001). There was an association between earning a C or better in the course sequence and 70% or higher in the post-assessment instrument (p < 0.05). Final course grades for Bio 135A were calculated from three open ended exams and the percentage of correct answers on the clicker questions. For Bio135B, final grades were calculated from three open ended exams, clicker responses, a seven-page literature review on an environmental carcinogen and its effects on signal transduction pathways, and a formal presentation of one of the research articles they used in the literature review. The students who took the second semester of the course passed at higher rates than the students who enrolled in the traditional-lecture course (p < 0.05). Clicker answers to the research problem sets and the final course grades correlated significantly for both semesters of the course sequence (p < 0.01). We conclude that conceptually-connected learning gains can be obtained when the content is taught in a format that includes short lectures and group work to solve research questions.

AB This article describes a comprehensive practical laboratory method for developing an enzyme to more easily measure glyphosate levels in solution. Through this article, undergraduate students of biology majors can conduct research experiments in critical fields by utilizing various techniques, such as chemiluminescence (CL) biosensors with engineered enzymes and are guided in molecular biology laboratories. A glyphosate oxidase mutant library was constructed by DNA shuffling, and a glyphosate oxidase variant with increased glyphosate degradation activity was selected by using a high-throughput screening assay. Following protein overexpression in Escherichia coli (DE3) and purification by affinity chromatography, the glyphosate oxidase variant protein combined with luminol-H2O2 reaction was constructed as a new CL biosensor for detecting glyphosate in soils.

AB This study aimed to investigate the teaching effect of the blended BOPPPS based on an online and offline mixed teaching model ( "B + BOPPPS ") in the course of fermentation engineering in applied universities. The participants were 142 undergraduates majoring from the course of fermentation engineering in Food Science and Engineering in 2019 and 2020 in Huanghuai University, Zhumadian city, Henan province, China. The students in the control group (68 students) were taught in 2019, and the students in the experimental group (74 students) were taught in 2020. The traditional teaching method and "B + BOPPPS " were implemented, respectively. The teaching effect was evaluated using the questionnaire survey of course satisfaction and theoretical knowledge test. The results showed that the scores of the theoretical knowledge test in the experimental group adopting "B + BOPPPS " were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The students had a good evaluation of the "B + BOPPPS " in many aspects, which included achieving learning goals, providing in-depth understanding of knowledge points, stimulating interest in learning, training in the ability to analyze and think about problems, and so on. The results suggested that "B + BOPPPS " could stimulate students' interest in learning and improve their subjective initiative. They could also improve students' ability to master and apply knowledge, which was conducive to improving the theoretical teaching quality of the course of fermentation engineering.

AB Researchers have called for undergraduate courses to update teaching frameworks based on the Modern Synthesis with insights from molecular biology, by stressing the molecular underpinnings of variation and adaptation. To support this goal, we developed a modified version of the widely used Assessing Conceptual Reasoning of Natural Selection (ACORNS) instrument. The expanded tool, called the E-ACORNS, is explicitly designed to test student understanding of the connections among genotypes, phenotypes, and fitness. E-ACORNS comprises a slight modification to the ACORNS open-response prompts and a new scoring rubric. The rubric is based on five core concepts in evolution by natural selection, with each concept broken into elements at the novice, intermediate, and expert-level understanding. Initial tests of the E-ACORNS showed that (1) upper-level undergraduates can score responses reliably and quickly, and (2) students who were just starting an introductory biology series for majors do not yet grasp the molecular basis of phenotypic variation and its connection to fitness.

AB Biomedical science students need to learn to code. Graduates face a future where they will be better prepared for research higher degrees and the workforce if they can code. Embedding coding in a biomedical curriculum comes with challenges. First, biomedical science students often experience anxiety learning quantitative and computational thinking skills and second biomedical faculty often lack expertise required to teach coding. In this study, we describe a creative coding approach to building coding skills in students using the packages of Processing and Arduino. Biomedical science students were taught by an interdisciplinary faculty team from Medicine and Health, Science and Architecture, Design and Planning. We describe quantitative and qualitative responses of students to this approach. Cluster analysis revealed a diversity of student responses, with a large majority of students who supported creative coding in the curriculum, a smaller but vocal cluster, who did not support creative coding because either the exercises were not sufficiently challenging or were too challenging and believed coding should not be in a Biomedical Science curriculum. We describe how two creative coding platforms, Processing and Arduino, embedded and used to visualize human physiological data, and provide responses to students, including those minority of students, who are opposed to coding in the curriculum This study found a variety of students responses in a final year capstone course of an undergraduate Biomedical Science degree where future pathways for students are either in research higher degrees or to the workforce with a future which will be increasingly data driven.

AB Student preparation has been shown to be of appreciable importance to student success in laboratory components of science courses. To promote student engagement prior to each laboratory session, technique and content videos, online assessments, and additional methods aiming to decrease cognitive load have been put into effect. Edpuzzle allows for instructors to effectively combine all of these components on a free, user-friendly, cloud-based platform. To improve student experience and performance in the introductory Biochemistry laboratory, Edpuzzle videos were incorporated into the curriculum. Ten videos were created and assigned to students on the platform. The platform allowed students to view the videos at their own pace and provided immediate feedback from assessments embedded within the videos. Student perceptions of Edpuzzle were favorable and the platform helped to promote student engagement in the material prior to the laboratory session which resulted in improvements in the Biochemistry lab experience. Edpuzzle has shown to be a highly effective tool for student engagement in the Biochemistry laboratory and can be utilized in other undergraduate laboratories as a replacement for existing pre-laboratory preparation methods.

AB The year 2020 will forever be remembered as a season of pandemic teaching due to rising COVID-19 infections. Institutions of higher learning abruptly changed from in-person to online in attempts to minimize COVID-19 spread. Due to this, we created and taught online cell biology labs in response to the COVID-19 campus shutdown. Our virtual cell biology lab course emphasized molecular and cellular biology methods that can be used to study cells. Our report includes cell biology lab descriptions, learning outcomes, skills learned, lab set up and format, virtual tools used, lab sources, and lessons learned. We show how creative online lab alternatives can provide students valuable scientific learning experiences when in-person learning is not possible.

AB Metabolism and its regulation is one of the most complex and difficult topics for students learning biochemistry. A problem-/case-based learning (PBL) approach can be useful to help biochemistry students to fulfill the goal of acquiring an integrated view of metabolism and its regulation. The present article describes our experience enrolling volunteer students to learn glycogen metabolism making use of a design-based research methodology to develop teaching learning sequences focused on a PBL approach. Enrolled undergraduate students had better final scores than those students that did not participates. Furthermore, enrolled students were satisfied with the experience, finding it interesting, formative, and challenging.

AB The fundamental mechanism of biochemistry lies on the reaction kinetics, which is determined by the reaction pathways. Interestingly, the reaction pathway is a challenging concept for undergraduate students. Experimentally, it is difficult to observe, and theoretically, it requires some degree of physics knowledge, namely statistical and quantum mechanics. However, students can utilize computational methods to study the reaction kinetics without paying too much attention but not wholly neglecting the comprehension of physics. We hereby provided an approach to study the reaction kinetics based on density-functional calculations. We particularized the study of the isomerization case involving five molecules at three different temperatures and emphasized the importance of the transition state in the study of reaction kinetics. The results we presented were in good agreement with the experiments and provided useful insights to assist students in the application of their knowledge into their research.

AB Apart from classroom presentations to their instructors and peer groups, STEM students have limited opportunities or encouragement to engage in guided communication of scientific concepts to others (family, friends, or the general public). A critical need exists for accurate, comprehensible science to be disseminated to these groups. To develop student proficiency in communication of complex biomolecular concepts impacting diverse audiences, I introduce learning approaches and assessments easily adapted to fit the needs of individual instructors and any molecular biology or biochemistry laboratory or lecture course in a remote/online environment. To help students develop an appreciation of the needs of different audiences and the nuanced drivers of clear communication, I provided them the choice of projects of similar length: Option (1) Create a scientific news release and short podcast or video clip newscast describing a recent advancement in understanding the molecular/biochemical basis of a disease; or Option (2) Create a lesson plan and mini-video designed to teach a simple biochemical or molecular mechanism of disease with learning objectives, a brief activity, and appropriate assessment mechanisms. Students who chose the scientific news release/newscast activity distilled complex biomolecular concepts using the 5 W's of journalism-who, what, where, why, when-and learned to accurately communicate the relevance of advanced scientific discoveries and recent events for a broader audience. Students who chose the lesson plan designed activities centered on biomolecular science concepts that build upon what their audience already knows, revealing possibilities for undergraduates to contribute to educational outreach to secondary school teachers and classes.

AB Cell phones have long been known as a potential distraction from attention intensive activities such as studying and driving. Many, however, are developing the cell phone as a powerful tool to augment some of these same activities. Audience response systems (ARSs) are a type of teaching tool that allows educators to poll audience members in real time. Increasingly, cell phones are being integrated into ARSs to make them more versatile and affordable. As cell phones and other personal electronic devices (tablets, laptops) are becoming more common classroom learning tools, we sought to explore how student cell phone use is impacted by this change. Additionally, we studied how a student's seat location and how the time during a term impacts students' cell phone use. To measure student cell phone use in lecture, we observed introductory biology classes at the University of Washington and recorded when students' cell phones were visible. We found that students sitting in the back of the room showed an increased likelihood of having a cell phone out. However contrary to our expectations, students using personal device (cell phone) based polling technology were no more likely to be using cell phones during lecture than their peers using traditional ARSs. Our results suggest that the downsides to using cell phones as teaching tools may be limited. (c) 2019 The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(5):538-546, 2019.

AB Undergraduate research experiences are excellent opportunities to engage students in science alongside experienced scientists, but at large institutions, it is challenging to accommodate all students. To address and engage a larger number of students, we developed a modular laboratory course based on the course-based undergraduate research experiences model. This new course was integrated with the scientific aims of a research laboratory studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration in planarians. In this course, students were asked to identify genes with roles in planarian biology. Students analyzed and cloned an assigned gene, determined its expression pattern in situ and examined its function in regeneration. Additionally, we developed critical thinking and scientific communication skills by incorporating activities focused on critical concepts. Students obtained high quality primary data and were successful in completing and mastering the course learning outcomes. They benefitted by developing basic research skills, learning to perform, trouble-shooting experiments, reading and critically analyzing primary literature, and using the information to defend and explain their experimental results. Through this course, students also increased their confidence and ability to perform independent scientific research. The course was designed to make it accessible to the community to implement and adapt as appropriate in diverse institutions.

AB This innovative comprehensive experiment is a compulsory course for third-year undergraduate students in the eight-year training program leading to a Doctor of Medicine degree or Doctor of Philosophy degree at Peking University Health Science Center (PKUHSC). There is a critical educational need to prepare these students for the increasing accessibility of research experience. This experimental curriculum of medical cell biology was developed to fulfill such a requirement, which consists of three experiments, including the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tetrazolium) assay and the immunofluorescence and comet assays to observe antitumor drug-induced cell apoptosis. This experiment-based teaching system provides the participating students an opportunity to enhance their understanding of important biological research techniques and the instrumentation involved and to foster a better understanding of the research process within the classroom. Upon completion of the course, students' feedback showed that the curriculum increased their confidence in performing molecular techniques, and they reported positively on doing a research project in class. This course helped students improve their understanding of theoretical knowledge and actual research processes and contributed to their foundation for future research.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA can result in phenotypes where the biochemical basis may not be clear due to the lack of protein structures. With the growing number of modeling and simulation software available on the internet, students can now participate in determining how small changes in genetic information impact cellular protein structure and function. We have developed a modular series of activities to engage lab or lecture students in examining the basis for common phenotypes. The activities range from basic phenotype testing/observation to DNA sequencing and simulation of protein structure and dynamics. We provide as an example study of the bitterness receptor TAS2R38 and PTC tasting, however these activities are applicable to other SNPs or genomic variants with a direct connection to an observable phenotype. These activities are modular and can be mixed to meet the student capabilities and infrastructure availability. The complete sequence of activities will demonstrate the direct connection between gene structure, protein structure and organism function.

AB The flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein, otherwise known as the central dogma of biology, is one of the most basic and overarching concepts in the biological sciences. Nevertheless, numerous studies have reported student misconceptions at the undergraduate level of this fundamental process of gene expression. This study reports on the efficacy of a model system for teaching gene expression in the undergraduate laboratory. A student-centered investigation of Tgfb1 gene expression in two murine melanoma cell lines was used to emphasize not only the process of gene expression but also various research methods for studying this phenomenon. Traditional RT-PCR, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and flow cytometry-based in situ hybridization assays were employed to study expression of this immunosuppressive cytokine gene in the highly tumorigenic B16-F1 melanoma cell line and the poorly tumorigenic D5.1G4 melanoma cell line, both at the population and single-cell levels. A pre- and post-laboratory assessment instrument demonstrated the utility of this model system in enhancing student learning both of content related to gene expression and of research methods and data analysis skills. The pedagogical approach described in this study is therefore an effective way to improve the teaching and learning of gene expression at the undergraduate level.

AB Learning often improves when active learning techniques are used in place of traditional lectures. For many of these techniques, however, students are expected to apply concepts that they have already grasped. A challenge, therefore, is how to incorporate active learning into the classroom of courses with heavy content, such as molecular-based biology courses. An additional challenge is that visual literacy is often overlooked in undergraduate science education. To address both of these challenges, a technique called figure analysis was developed and implemented in three different levels of undergraduate biology courses. Here, students learn content while gaining practice in interpreting visual information by discussing figures with their peers. Student groups also make connections between new and previously learned concepts on their own while in class. The instructor summarizes the material for the class only after students grapple with it in small groups. Students reported a preference for learning by figure analysis over traditional lecture, and female students in particular reported increased confidence in their analytical abilities. There is not a technology requirement for this technique; therefore, it may be utilized both in classrooms and in nontraditional spaces. Additionally, the amount of preparation required is comparable to that of a traditional lecture. (c) 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 44(4):336-344, 2016.

AB Benefits of incorporating research experiences into laboratory courses have been well documented, yet examples of research projects designed for the first semester introductory organic chemistry lab course are extremely rare. To address this deficiency, a Carbohydrate-Based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Inhibitor project consisting of a synthetic scheme of four reactions was developed for and implemented in the first semester organic lab. Students carried out the synthetic reactions during the last 6 of 10 total labs in the course, generating carbohydrate-based dimeric target molecules modeled after published dimers with application in HIV therapy. The project was designed to provide a research experience through use of literature procedures for reactions performed, exploration of variation in linker length in the target structure, and synthesis of compounds not previously reported in the scientific literature. Project assessment revealed strong student support, indicating enhanced engagement and interest in the course as a direct result of the use of scientific literature and the applications of the synthesized carbohydrate-based molecules. Regardless of discussed challenges in designing a research project for the first semester lab course, the finding from data analysis that a project implemented in the first semester lab had significantly greater student impact than a second semester project should provide motivation for development of additional research projects for a first semester organic course.

AB Spectrophotometric analysis is essential for determining biomolecule concentration of a solution and is employed ubiquitously in biochemistry and molecular biology. The application of the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer Lawis routinely used to determine the concentration of DNA, RNA or protein. There is however a significant difference in determining the concentration of a given species (RNA, DNA, protein) in isolation (a contrived circumstance) as opposed to determining that concentration in the presence of other species (a more realistic situation). To present the student with a more realistic laboratory experience and also to fill a hole that we believe exists in student experience prior to reaching a biochemistry course, we have devised a three week laboratory experience designed so that students learn to: connect laboratory practice with theory, apply the Beer-Lambert-Bougert Law to biochemical analyses, demonstrate the utility and limitations of example quantitative colorimetric assays, demonstrate the utility and limitations of UV analyses for biomolecules, develop strategies for analysis of a solution of unknown biomolecular composition, use digital micropipettors to make accurate and precise measurements, and apply graphing software.

AB A blended approach encompassing problem-based learning (PBL) and structured inquiry was used in this laboratory exercise based on the congenital disease Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), to introduce commonly used techniques in biomolecular analysis within a clinical context. During a series of PBL sessions students were presented with several scenarios involving a 2 year old child, who had experienced numerous fractures. Key learning goals related to both the theory and practical aspects of the course, covering biomolecular analysis and functional genomics, were identified in successive PBL sessions. The laboratory exercises were conducted in 3 hour blocks over six weeks, focused firstly on protein analysis, followed by nucleic acids. Students isolated collagen from normal and OI affected fibroblast cultures. Analysis by SDS-PAGE demonstrated 1 and 2 of collagen Type I chains at approximately 95 kDa and 92 kDa, respectively. Subtle differences in protein mobility between the control and OI samples were observed by some students, but most considered it inconclusive as a diagnostic tool. The nucleic acid module involved isolation of RNA from OI affected fibroblasts. The RNA was reverse transcribed and used as template to amplify a 354 bp COL1A1 fragment. Students were provided with the sequence of the OI affected COL1A1 PCR product aligned with the normal COL1A1 sequence, allowing identification of the mutation, as the substitution of Arg for Gly976 of the triple helical region. Our experience with student cohorts over several years is that presentation of this laboratory exercise within a relevant clinical context, and the opportunity for active engagement with the experimental procedures via PBL sessions, supported the learning of basic theory and practical techniques of biomolecular analysis.

AB Research on external representations in biochemistry has uncovered student difficulties in comprehending and interpreting external representations. This project focuses on students' understanding of three external representations of the potassium ion channel protein. This is part I of a two-part study, which focuses on the affordances and limitations of representations of the potassium ion channel according to students across the chemistry and biochemistry curriculum. Analysis showed that if the students do not possess the required prior knowledge then they are stymied in their interpretations of the representations. Students were able to easily interpret the familiar ribbon diagram representation; however, they found the vines and hydrophobic/polar representations to be less informative. Suggestions for instruction are to probe student understanding and to help students activate prior knowledge to build a more connected set of concepts pertaining to protein structure.

AB Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) plays a pivotal role in the central dogma of molecular biology. Importantly, molecular events occurring during and after mRNA synthesis have the potential to create multiple proteins from one gene, leading to some of the remarkable protein diversity that genomes hold. The North Carolina State University Biotechnology Program developed and implemented a new, laboratory-intensive course to provide students with a contemporary view of mRNA entitled mRNA: Transcription and Processing. This course, offered at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, aimed to introduce students to the many functions of RNA, with an emphasis on mRNA. In addition to fundamental aspects of these processes, students were exposed to cutting-edge techniques used to analyze mRNA in both lecture and laboratory components. We evaluated this course over two semesters and found that learning outcomes were met by both undergraduate and graduate students, based on assessments such as laboratory reports, pre-lab assignments, a final exam, and successful results in the laboratory. We also examined student perceptions through anonymous surveys, where students reported gains in confidence in both conceptual knowledge and technical skill after completing this course.

AB Practical skills and competencies are critical to student engagement and effective learning in laboratory courses. This article describes the design of a yearlong, stand-alone laboratory coursethe Biotechniques Laboratorya common core course in the second year of all our degree programs in the biological sciences. It is an enabling, introductory laboratory course with a focus on the development of basic, practical skills, competencies, and knowledge in experimental techniques commonly used across the biological sciences. It is based on a full hands on approach where all students undertake a variety of practical exercises derived principally from the disciplines of biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and microbiology. Explicit skills training, the opportunity to repeat laboratory exercises until the required skill and/or competency is achieved, the consolidation of learned skills in different contexts throughout the course and a competency based assessment method are all distinctive features that facilitate the achievement of the desired student outcomes. Students graduate from this course enabled to more effectively engage and achieve in advanced laboratory courses and research projects developing higher order skills and knowledge for use in graduate studies and/or employment.

AB In this work extensive misconceptions of university students' -from nutrition area- about the metabolism of carbohydrates (CHM) in the human organism have been documented. The results lead to consider their difficulties concerning the learning of a complex set of imbricated biochemical models involved. Pursuant to these considerations, three physiological models are proposed as conceptual axes around which CHM in the human organism could be taught, in order to avoid fragmentation in students' knowledge and to give simple physiological contexts where to integrate those biochemical models. These contexts are: (a) a physiological model of the carbon cycle, (b) a physiological model of blood glucose uptake and homeostasis, and (c) a physiological model of the availability of small metabolites.

AB Three dimensional (3D) design and printing are customizable and cost-effective approaches to developing small equipment and other items for use in various interdisciplinary applications. However, many pedagogical approaches to 3D printing focus more on the generation of artifacts than on the involvement of students as creators. Moreover, library makerspaces offer 3D printing services but cannot always engage the students with practical applications of their designs. We sought to determine if promoted use of 3D printing could be developed in biology laboratory trainees, ranging from undergraduate students to postdoctoral fellows. We combined two instructional workshops in the San Diego State University Library build IT makerspace, with two individual assignments to build items for the research laboratory. Evaluation of the course revealed that participants had expected the design and print processes to be of high complexity, but learned that the necessary skills could be acquired and applied in a relatively short period of time. Also, we found that trainees became proficient in 3D design and printing, and that a majority of individuals used 3D printing for subsequent applications. This effective translation of 3D printing to the research laboratory can be a paradigm for how 3D fabrication is taught. Moreover, this approach required the collaboration of library makerspace and research faculty, underlining the value of embedded librarianship in enhancing training and knowledge.

AB Effectively teaching scientific reasoning requires an understanding of the challenges students face when learning these skills. We designed an assessment that measures undergraduate student abilities to form hypotheses, design experiments, and interpret data from experiments in cellular and molecular biology. The assessment uses intermediate-constraint free-response questions with a defined rubric to facilitate use with large classes, while identifying common reasoning errors that may prevent students from becoming proficient at designing and interpreting experiments. The assessment measured a statistically significant improvement in a senior-level biochemistry laboratory course, and a larger improvement between the biochemistry lab students and a separate cohort in a first-year introductory biology lab course. Two common errors were identified for forming hypotheses and using experimental controls. Students frequently constructed a hypothesis that was a restatement of the observation it was supposed to explain. They also often made comparisons to control conditions not included in an experiment. Both errors were most frequent among first-year students, and decreased in frequency as students completed the senior-level biochemistry lab. Further investigation of the absent controls error indicated that difficulties with reasoning about experimental controls may be widespread in undergraduate students. The assessment was a useful instrument for measuring improvement in scientific reasoning at different levels of instruction, and identified errors that can be targeted to improve instruction in the process of science.

AB The COVID-19 outbreak has created turbulence and uncertainty into multiple aspects of life in countries around the world. In China, the pandemic continues to pose a great challenge to the nature of traditional in-class education in schools. Chinese education has faced the difficult decision of whether to resume in-person teaching in an unprecedented and time-pressured manner. To ensure the quality of teaching and learning during this time, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of an "online + in-person " hybrid teaching model with a new three-part approach to the hybrid teaching lab, where students prepare for the in-person lab using virtual simulated experiments and learning modules and debrief their learning afterwards online as well. This approach not only enhances the efficiency during the in-person lab but also strongly reinforces concepts and laboratory skills by providing a "practice run " before physically attending the lab. A total of 400 medical undergraduates from Dalian Medical University in China were recruited for this study. In an undergraduate molecular biology laboratory course, we observed 200 students in a hybrid teaching model. We evaluated the learning outcomes from the "online + in-person " hybrid teaching model with a questionnaire survey and assessed the quality of experiment execution, report writing, and group collaboration. Moreover, the 200 students from the hybrid group were evaluated during an annual science competition at the university and compared to 200 students from the competition cohort who had no experience with a hybrid learning model. The comparison data were analyzed using a student's t-test statistical analysis. The students in the hybrid learning group demonstrated a strong enthusiasm for the model, high amount of time utilizing the online system, and high scores on laboratory evaluation assignments. Approximately 98% of the hybrid learning students reported that they preferred mixed teaching to the traditional teaching mode, and all students scored above 96% on the online laboratory report. Teachers of the course observed that the hybrid group had a noticeably higher level of proficiency in lab skills compared to the previous students. At the Dalian Medical University annual science competition, where we compared our hybrid group to a traditional learning group, scores for both the objective and subjective items showed that the students instructed with the hybrid lab model had superior performance (p < 0.05). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a new three-part molecular biology laboratory course that strongly improved students' laboratory skills, knowledge retention, and enthusiasm for the course using online learning to improve their learning efficiency and expedite the in-person laboratory experience. We found that these students performed at a higher level in a combined theoretical/practical science competition compared to the students in traditional in-person lab courses. Additionally, our model subjectively fostered enthusiasm and excellence in both teachers and students. Further, cultivation of the students' independent learning and creative problem solving skills were emphasized. The exploration of an effective teaching model, such as the one described here, not only provides students with a solid foundation for their future medical studies and career development but also promotes more efficient in-person laboratory time.

AB The use of a molecular viewer to visualize proteins has become more prevalent in high schools in recent years. We relied on the foundations of two theoretical frameworks to analyze questions in two learning tasks designed for 10th- to 12th-grade biotechnology majors that make use of Jmol. The two theoretical frameworks were: (i) classification of scientific knowledge into content, procedural, and epistemic knowledge; and (ii) evaluation of the cognitive skills central to visual literacy in biochemistry. During the analysis, two sub-elements of procedural knowledge emerged from the data: (i) the visualization of molecular models, and (ii) the use of Jmol software features. Based on the theoretical frameworks and data analysis, we suggest a conceptualization of learning about proteins using a molecular viewer, where the scientific knowledge elements are integrated with the eight cognitive skills central to visual literacy in biochemistry. In addition, a model presenting a hierarchy for the knowledge elements and sub-elements is suggested. In this model, content knowledge is a basic requirement; without it, the other knowledge elements cannot be used. Moreover, the use of epistemic knowledge or Jmol software features is not possible without visualization of the molecular models, which requires content knowledge. This conceptualization is expected to facilitate the development of learning tasks, decrease the complexity of knowledge acquisition for students; it may also assist the teacher during the teaching process.

AB In this information era, there is an urgent need for tighter integration of bioinformatics and experimental biology. The enormous amount of data generated by biological experiments calls for extensive computational analysis. Many bioinformatics textbooks at present mainly focus on theories, which hinders the vigorous development of scientific research. As a result, most students are simply familiar with the bioinformatics theories but lack the opportunity to put them into practice. Here, we present our bioinformatics docking project conducted during the self-isolation period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five students used the RBD-ACE2 complex as a benchmark to conduct a systematic comparison of several open-source online molecular docking programs. The virus surface spike protein mediates the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into human cells by binding to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through its receptor-binding domain (RBD). Through docking and comparing predicted structures to the crystal structure, students gained the opportunity to practice different bioinformatics tools independently and conduct research collaboratively. It opens a window for students to reach out to the state-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques and to keep up with the research trends. The online workshop has also proven to be an innovative method for bioinformatics teaching. We hope our work can inspire other educators to develop strategies to expose undergraduate students to modern bioinformatics and turn every temporary difficulty into a possible learning opportunity.

AB As a high-impact educational practice, cooperative learning uses a structured group study to promote students' active learning. Currently, it lacks economical yet effective tools to facilitate the interactive nature of structured cooperative learning in regular classrooms. Here, we have established a mobile technology-based cooperative learning (MBCL) platform that comprises the 2018 iPad, Apple Pencil, LiveBoard, Google Forms, and Google Drive. We tested the MBCL platform in multiple undergraduate biology courses. During semester-long MBCL studies, the students engaged in cooperative learning to discuss a real-life issue or chapter-based contents. With the MBCL platform, the students' group study processes were shown on shared, visible electronic whiteboards that were updated in real-time, generating visible thinking and instant, interactive communication. The instructor was able to guide the students promptly to conduct knowledge integration and knowledge synthesis using tables and diagrams. The deep learning outcome was evident in the examples and quantitative analyses of students' whiteboard study results and team presentations. Thus, integrating innovative mobile technologies into high-impact teaching practices, exemplified by the MBCL platform, promotes deep learning in higher education.

AB Volatile-mediated impacts of microbes on plants have aroused interest among scientists in the life science field. This study describes an inquiry-based laboratory module named "Microbial Talk", which related to microbial volatile-mediated communication, including the process of design, implementation, and assessment. First-year biology students in this course were allowed to complete authentic microbiology research using both typical experimental techniques and knowledge related to interspecies communication. The instructor provides continued guidance and support to ensure that students are aware of their knowledge and of the choices they encountered. Pretests and posttests were implemented to evaluate the efficacy of the "Microbial Talk" and the students' experimental design ability. Assessment of the module showed that students gained self-efficacy in executing experiments and interpreting data. In conclusion, this module is cost-effective and it can be used to help guide students in their future when they encounter situations that need these scientific skills.

AB CRISPR-cas technology is being incorporated into undergraduate biology curriculum through lab experiences to immerse students in modern technology that is rapidly changing the landscape of science, medicine and agriculture. We developed and implemented an educational module that introduces students to CRISPR-cas technology in a Genetic course and an Advanced Genetics course. Our primary teaching objective was to immerse students in the design, strategy, conceptual modeling, and application of CRISPR-cas technology using the current research claim of the modification of theCCR5gene in twin girls. This also allowed us to engage students in an open conversation about the bioethical implications of heritable germline and non-heritable somatic genomic editing. We assessed student-learning outcomes and conclude that this learning module is an effective strategy for teaching undergraduates the fundamentals and application of CRISPR-cas gene editing technology and can be adapted to other genes and diseases that are currently being treated with CRISPR-cas technology.

AB Technique-centered biochemistry or molecular biology undergraduate laboratory curricula do not offer significant opportunities for thoughtful, in-depth exploration of the science to foster investigative learning. To demonstrate inclusion of inquiry-driven laboratory experiments into the undergraduate biochemistry and molecular biology curricula, a comprehensive set of laboratory experiments, covering several principles of biochemistry and molecular biology, have been developed under a single theme. The laboratory curriculum described here comprehensively investigates bacterial cellobiose metabolism using multiple biochemical, molecular biological (RNA isolation, RT-PCR, PCR, and enzyme assay), and analytical techniques (High Performance Liquid Chromatography, NMR, spectrophotometry, and thin-layer chromatography) to explore the principles of metabolomics and genomics in a single undergraduate laboratory course setting using Caulobacter crescentus as the model organism. This laboratory module serves as a model for educators to develop easy-to-implement laboratory curricula incorporating contemporary biochemistry and molecular biology concepts and techniques to provide a course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) with defined learning objectives.

AB University lectures are mainly passive in nature, and there are few subjects in which students need to learn and function independently. Tutorial education and related activities at universities that specialize in medical and pharmaceutical training have been actively carried out, and lectures in conjunction with practical skills are gradually being developed, although progress has been slow in this area. In past years, our biochemistry practice classes have been evaluated in reports dealing with experiments and written examinations, as is done in other universities. However, using this methodology, we are not able to evaluate the extent to which students master biochemical experimental skills. To address this, we introduced a basic skill test to our biochemical curriculum for the first time. Our exams contributed to a deeper understanding of student skills and could be good tools for evaluating the degree of understanding of the students. The students understood the contents of the training well and felt interested in research in the field of basic medicine. Thus, we conclude that introducing practical testing to biochemical practice was effective for medical students in the field of biochemistry.

AB The concepts of phospholipase activity is often taught in undergraduate biology and biochemistry classes and reinforced in laboratory exercises. However, very rarely does the design of these exercises allow students to directly gain experience in the use of modern instruments such as digital imaging systems and fluorescence spectrophotometers. The laboratory exercise described here involves the use of fluorescent lipids to evaluate phospholipase activity. Students use thin layer chromatography (TLC) to understand how lipids change under different conditions (i.e. abiotic and biotic stress). They explore strategies to separate, visualize and quantify lipids by TLC, digital imaging, and fluorometry. They also have increased opportunities for hands-on practise with experimental design, liposome sample preparation, and implementation of instrumentation commonly used by experienced researchers; all while learning and applying fundamental concepts about lipids.

AB Several course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been published in the literature. However, only limited attempts have been made to rigorously identify the discovery-type research abilities that students actually develop during such experiences. Instead, there has been a greater focus on technical or procedural-type knowledge or general CURE skills that are too comprehensive to effectively assess. Before the extent of discovery-type learning outcomes can be established in students (termed verified learning outcomes or VLOs), it is important to rigorously identify the anticipated learning outcomes (ALOs) and to then develop student assessments that target each ALO to reveal the nature of such student learning. In this article we present a matrix of 43 ALOs, or course-based undergraduate research abilities (CURAs), that instructors anticipate students will develop during a recently-developed biochemistry CURE focusing on the prediction of protein function from structure. The CURAs were identified using the process for identifying course-based undergraduate research abilities (PICURA) and classified into seven distinct themes that enabled the characterization of the CURE and a comparison to other published inventories of research competencies and CURE aspects. These themes and the CURE protocols aligning to the CURAs were used to form the ALO matrix that was, in turn, used to inform the design of an assessment that revealed evidence that a student had developed some of the targeted CURAs. Future research will focus on further assessment development that targets other identified CURAs. This approach has potential applications to other CUREs both in biochemistry and other science disciplines. (c) 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(5):478-492, 2018.

AB To facilitate learning advanced instrumental techniques, essential tools for visualizing biomaterials, a simple and versatile laboratory exercise demonstrating the use of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in biomedical applications was developed. In this experiment, the morphology of heat-denatured and amyloid-type aggregates formed from a low-cost and well-characterized model protein, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), are compared. Structural differences between the amorphous and ordered particles are quantified using ImageJ for the analysis of AFM images as a postlaboratory assignment. The laboratory exercise allows the direct observation of changes in the protein structure and helps students to understand the operation of AFM, as well as protein folding and misfolding related to many physiological and pathological processes. The described protocol stands alone, but also fits well into a larger module on protein structure and function or microscopic techniques as it can be linked easily to existing laboratory exercises on these topics. It can be easily adapted to the upper level undergraduate laboratory courses with limited lab hours as well as graduate level courses to improve students' research skills.

AB Structures and functions of protein motifs are widely included in many biology-based course syllabi. However, little emphasis is placed to link this knowledge to applications in biotechnology to enhance the learning experience. Here, the conserved motifs of nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRR) proteins, successfully used for the isolation and characterization of many plant resistance gene analogues (RGAs), is featured in the development of a series of laboratory experiments using important molecular biology techniques. A set of previously isolated RGA sequences is used as the model for performing sequence alignment and visualising 3D protein structure using current bioinformatics programs (Clustal Omega and Argusdock software). A pair of established degenerate primer sequences is provided for the prediction of targeted amino acids sequences in the RGAs. Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to amplify RGAs from total RNA samples extracted from the tropical wild relative of black pepper, Piper colubrinum (Piperaceae). This laboratory exercise enables students to correlate specific DNA sequences with respective amino acid codes and the interaction between conserved motifs of resistance genes with putatively targeted proteins.

AB The effect of scientific training on course learning in undergraduates is still controversial. In this study, we investigated the academic performance of undergraduate students with and without scientific training. The results show that scientific training improves students' test scores in general medical courses, such as biochemistry and molecular biology, cell biology, physiology, and even English. We classified scientific training into four levels. We found that literature reading could significantly improve students' test scores in general courses. Students who received scientific training carried out experiments more effectively and published articles performed better than their untrained counterparts in biochemistry and molecular biology examinations. The questionnaire survey demonstrated that the trained students were more confident of their course learning, and displayed more interest, motivation and capability in course learning. In summary, undergraduate academic performance is improved by scientific training. Our findings shed light on the novel strategies in the management of undergraduate education in the medical school.

AB An interactive chart of energy metabolism with didactic function, complementary to the already existing metabolic maps, located at the URL is being presented. The chart illustrates the major catabolic and biosynthetic pathways of glucose, fatty acids, and aminoacids, individually as well as in an integrated view. For every metabolite and reaction an information sheet may be presented at the side of the map as fancybox, containing chemical structural formulae, an external link to the KEGG database and links that lead to the reactions at which the produced metabolites may participate as reactants. The latter allows the user to navigate through metabolic reactions following a route similar to the metabolic flow of substances, while keeping track of the occurring chemical transformations. Simultaneously, users may observe how they move across the metabolic map, possibly along different pathways, thus enhancing the user's integrated perception of metabolism. The site has already been introduced in biochemistry lectures and the students evaluated it. Most students were helped a lot or more to understand individual pathways as well as their interconnections and they also found it pleasant and easy to navigate. The vast majority of the students considered its use in the classroom desired. The chart currently may be displayed in English and in Greek while more languages can be integrated in the future. The authors' view, in accordance to the users' perception, is that the presented site may offer biochemistry tutors and students a useful teaching aid.

AB To ensure a modern bioscience curriculum that responds to the current needs of stakeholders, there is a need to embed a range of generic capabilities that enables graduates to succeed in and contribute to a rapidly changing world, as well as building strong bioscience skills and knowledge. The curriculum must also prepare students for a rapidly evolving competitive work place and align with the needs of industry. This creates a challenge, how do we develop generic capabilities without losing discipline content. This report analyses teamwork projects embedded in an undergraduate Biotechnology degree designed to promote teamwork skills along with a deeper understanding of the underpinning biochemistry. Student reflective writing was used to capture students' understanding and experience of teamwork as well as provide insight into their metacognition. The analysis demonstrates that 73% of Year 3 and 93% of Year 4 students were capable of learning about teamwork through reflective writing. While the importance of frequent high quality communication was a common theme, evidence suggests that many students were unsophisticated in their use of communication software. The analysis also highlighted the depth of metacognition that underpins successful team function and the significant weaknesses in self-insight some students possess. These findings challenge assumptions regarding student capacity for leadership and the ability of some students to contribute to successful team outcomes. It is essential for the design of teamwork experiences to fully understand the competencies that underlie teamwork, the metacognitive processes required, and ensure that assessments are fair and measure individual academic performance.

AB Immunological detection of proteins is an essential method to demonstrate to undergraduate biology students, however, is often difficult in resource and time poor student laboratory sessions. This method describes a failsafe method to rapidly and economically demonstrate this technique using biotinylated proteins or biotin itself as targets for detection. This negates the need for a specific primary antibody, saving cost and time. In addition, the easily available and safe reagents allow the methods to be readily adopted without specialist technical expertise. As a result, staff can confidently transfer ownership of the task to the student so as to also develop scientific inquiry skills which promotes student motivation and engagement.

AB This report describes the incorporation of digital learning elements in organic chemistry and biochemistry courses. The first example is the use of pen-based technology and a large-format PowerPoint slide to construct a map that integrates various metabolic pathways and control points. Students can use this map to visualize the integrated nature of metabolism and how various hormones impact metabolic regulation. The second example is the embedding of health-related YouTube videos directly into PowerPoint presentations. These videos become a part of the course notes and can be viewed within PowerPoint as long as students are online. The third example is the use of a webcam to show physical models during online sessions using web-conferencing software. Various molecular conformations can be shown through the webcam, and snapshots of important conformations can be incorporated into the notes for further discussion and annotation. Each of the digital learning elements discussed in this report is an attempt to use technology to improve the quality of educational resources available outside of the classroom to foster student engagement with ideas and concepts.

AB Students benefit most from their science education when they participate fully in the process of science in the context of real-world problems. We describe a student-directed open-inquiry lab experience that has no predetermined outcomes and requires students to engage in all components of scientific inquiry from posing a question through evaluating and reporting results. Over 5 weeks, students learn how bryophytes are used in forensics and become proficient in important molecular biology lab skills including DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and genotyping. For this portion of the experience, there is no specialized equipment necessary outside of gel electrophoresis supplies and a thermocycler. In an optional extension of the experience, students sequence a plastid intron and use introductory bioinformatics skills to identify species related to their forensics case. Students who participated in the lab experience performed well on content-based assessment, and student attitudes toward the experience were positive and indicative of engaged learning. The lab experience is easily modified for higher or lower level courses and can be used in secondary education.

AB This study examined the historical performance of students at Michigan State University in a two-part biochemistry series Biochem I (n 5,900) and Biochem II (n 5,214) for students enrolled from 1997 to 2009. Multiple linear regressions predicted 54.9-87.5% of the variance in student from Biochem I grade and 53.8-76.1% of the variance in student from Biochem II grade. Overall, the student's cumulative GPA has the primary influence on their biochemistry grade in Biochem I for all models whereas either cumulative GPA or Biochem I performance has the primary influence on Biochem II grade. These factors were far more influential than any other predictors as their beta values were larger (5-10 times larger depending on the model). However, the gender of the student was also statistically significant for Biochem I and more than half of our Biochem II models with female students always predicted lower than their equivalent male counterparts. Biochemistry majors were also found to perform better in Biochem I. Interestingly, grades earned in prerequisite courses such as introductory biology, chemistry, or organic chemistry and ethnicity provided no additional predictive ability about students' performance in biochemistry. Enrollment in an honors college or science residential college had little direct impact on performance in biochemistry.

DE CURE; online; undergraduates
AB The COVID-19 pandemic forced educators to teach in an online environment. This was particularly challenging for those teaching courses that are intended to support bench science research. This practitioner article tells the story of how an instructor transformed their Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) using the Backwards Design Method into a synchronous online course. Research objectives in this transformed course included: conducting a literature review, identifying research questions and hypotheses based on literature, and developing practical and appropriate research methodologies to test these hypotheses. We provide details on how assignments were created to walk students through the process of research study design and conclude with recommendations for the implementation of an online CURE. Recommendations made by the instructor include scaffolding the design, building opportunities for collaboration, and allowing students to fail in order to teach the value of iteration. The Backwards Design framework naturally lends itself to a scaffolded instructional approach. By identifying the learning objectives and final assessment, the learning activities can be designed to help students overcome difficult concepts by filling in the gaps with purposeful instruction and collaborative opportunities. This present course also practiced iteration through the extensive feedback offered by the instructor and opportunities for students to revise their work as their understanding deepened. Anecdotally, based on end of course reviews, students overall had a positive experience with this course. Future work will examine the efficacy of student learning in this online environment and is forthcoming.

SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE ketogenesis; ketolysis; metabolic pathway; story
ID BIOLOGY
AB Biochemistry is a core subject in the cross-disciplinary training on Biotechnology engineering courses. Metabolic pathways teaching has traditionally integrated hands-on laboratory experiences and traditional lectures, which detail a large number of reactions at a molecular level, their enzymes and regulation. The current scenario of Covid-19 outbreak have motivated the development of complementary tools that expand the horizon of metabolism teaching. In this study, we employed a story-based methodology to strengthen the metabolic pathways learning and to measure students' perception. Specifically, a peer-reviewed tale describing the ketone body metabolism was used during five semesters as a didactic strategy to teach this biochemical process. A questionnaire assessed the students' understanding and acceptance of the methodology (n = 83). Our findings showed that a high proportion of students (83.13%) were able to relate the story to the topics studied in the classroom (ketogenesis and ketolysis). On the other hand, they were satisfied and suggested that such methodology is effective and fun. In summary, most of the survey responses related to acceptance of story-based strategy ranged from 72% to 97%. Collectively, these results indicated that the story is appropriate to decomplex pathways, becoming a simple tool for driving motivation, learning and engagement of students. The narrative represents a bridge to connect the intriguing series of chemical reactions involved in the anabolism and degradation of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB), acetoacetate, and acetone with previously learned knowledge, emotions, and key concepts. In conclusion, the tale was useful to decode ketone body-related pathways and making metabolism learning more interesting and easier.

AB Lab activities in primary and secondary education are essential to promote students' scientific skills. In this article, we propose a lab activity where different antimicrobial agents are used to the microorganisms' susceptibility to them. Moreover, we produce a rubric, a scoring tool, to quantify students' replies and evaluate the whole activity. We concluded that using the scoring rubric, we have been able to evaluate students' replies and students' benefit.

AB Flipped classroom based on active learning is becoming an increasingly popular pedagogical method in higher education capable of increasing student performance in higher-order learning outcomes including application, analysis, evaluation, and creation. However, the success of a flipped classroom model relies on various supporting elements such as the accessibility of technology, and it may not be appropriate for all students and courses. In this study, a new blended biochemistry classroom model based on massive open online courses and a "semi-flipped" environment was applied to the students enrolled in three majors (stomatology, pharmacy, and preventive medicine) at Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, China. To assess the improvement of the students' perception of self-cognition in the blended biochemistry classes, surveys were conducted before and after undertaking the biochemistry course. Survey responses and total (final) score for the biochemistry course were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Compared to students who received traditional classroom instruction, students who participated in the blended classroom model achieved higher academic performance (p < 0.01) and reported a significant improvement in their perception of self-cognition (p < 0.01, or p < 0.05). More than 80% of participants preferred the blended classroom model to that of traditional classroom instruction.

AB Students often have no exposure to the incredible amount of genomic and proteomic data that is freely and easily accessible online. Becoming familiar with these resources, and seeing how they could be applied to a specific research question, is a prerequisite for students to apply them to their own scientific development. Many students have to "see it" and "do it" before they "get it." This paper describes a teaching laboratory for undergraduate Genetics students that combines exploration of several publicly available databases with some simple bioinformatic exercises and "'real" live experience in a wet lab exercise. The goal is to teach skills in applying genomic data to a real scientific question. In this exercise, students identify a target protein after exploring several protein and signal transduction databases, such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. They then search for the encoding RNA in a newly available sea star mature egg transcriptome database and for the DNA in an existing sea star genome database. The students design primers against specific regions or domains in their target RNA and amplify these by reverse transcription PCR against RNA purified from fresh sea star eggs. The PCR reactions are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. It is hoped that the combination of the computational biology exercises with the real lab work will excite the students and stimulate them to explore this exciting new biology further.

AB As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial for an introductory course in biochemistry to move from in-person instruction to total remote learning. There are four transferable skills in the course: problem-solving, laboratory psychomotor skills, data analysis and interpretation skills, and presentation skills. Since all lab buildings were closed for learning activities, we responded quickly to ensure the transferability of the skills. We modified the laboratory activity as a home discovery approach to achieve the desired skills. Students showed confidence and gratitude as they learned in a new way. In summary, modifying the laboratory activity helped students acquire laboratory-related skills but presented challenges in using laboratory equipment. This suggests that Home Discovery can be considered a hybrid approach to learning biochemistry.

AB Widely used in research laboratories, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a transferable skill that prepares undergraduate students for a variety of careers in the biomedical field. We have developed an inquiry-based learning IHC laboratory exercise, which introduces students to the theory, procedure, and data interpretation of antibody staining. Students are tasked with performing IHC using an "unknown" antibody and then asked to identify the cells or molecular structures within the nervous systems specific for that unknown antibody. In two lab sessions, students are exposed to handling of delicate brain slices, fluorescent microscopy, and data analysis using the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA), an online freely accessible database of mRNA transcript expression patterns in the brain. Here, we present guidelines for easy implementation in the classroom and assess learning gains achieved by the students upon completion of the IHC laboratory module. Students clearly displayed an increase in knowledge in data interpretation, procedural knowledge, and theory surrounding IHC. Thus, this module works as an inquiry-based learning based method to introduce IHC principles to undergraduate students.

AB Research experience is becoming an increasingly crucial element of today's undergraduate science curriculum. In recent years, the establishment of the Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience Network (CUREnet) has provided a framework for the development of courses aiming to cultivate students' proficiency in undergraduate research techniques while fostering scientific curiosity in a laboratory setting. Capstone Laboratory is one such course that was designed to provide second-year pre-medical students at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar with exposure to laboratory techniques to develop their repertoire of research skills. For the past 3 years, Capstone Laboratory has incorporated a project-based learning component involving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The research element of the NSAID-surfactant theme investigated the partitioning of various drugs into cationic surfactant micelles. Structural elements and enzyme inhibition characteristics of NSAIDs were also investigated, while integrating principles of biochemistry, general chemistry, and experimental organic chemistry. By studying drug properties in these contexts, students integrate their learning and develop skills needed for the study and practice of medicine.

ID RECOMMENDED CURRICULUM
AB DNA structure has been leveraged in a variety of facets that allow scientists to perform a range of assays, including ones for identification of species, establishing evolutionary relationships between taxa, or even identifying individuals. Here, we present a DNA barcoding method as practical, hands-on approach that connects several experimental techniques in one sequence to teach the principles behind DNA isolation, purification, PCR, sequencing, and phylogeny analysis. Our set of exercises is designed for a teaching university laboratory setting. The three laboratory class assignments utilize DNA from a mushroom (can be purchased at a supermarket) and provide a pipeline to guide students through the process of identifying an unknown sample, like in many research laboratories. The third assignment can be used as a stand-alone exercise on phylogeny analysis and can be taught remotely. Students explore the theory behind the standard molecular techniques and apply it in a hands-on setting that involves experimental design, sample preparation, and use of hallmark molecular instruments.

AB In the past 5 years, the MOOC-based teaching method has been extensively applied as an experimental educational method in medical education in China. However, the effects of this teaching method on medical education are still controversial and ambiguous. To assess the effectiveness of the MOOC-based teaching method in medical education in China, we conducted the meta-analysis. Literature search was performed through the PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge and CNKI databases through March 3, 2020. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of the MOOC-based teaching method in medical education in China were included in our meta-analysis. All data were pooled using a fixed- or random-effect model based on a heterogeneity test. Hedges' g was calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of the MOOC-based teaching method on the final exam knowledge scores of participants. Subgroup analyses were also carried out. There were 27 studies (25 records) identified in our meta-analysis. The final exam knowledge scores of participants were statistically higher in the MOOC group compared with the controls in medical courses in China (Hedges' g = 1.080, 95%CI 0.592-1.567, p < 0.001). Obvious heterogeneity across studies was found in the study. Further analysis demonstrated that a significant difference in favor of the MOOC-based teaching method compared with the traditional teaching method in medical students and doctors. The MOOC-based teaching method may be applicable to medical education in China, strengthening the roles of MOOCs in medical education.

AB Students tend to think of their science courses as isolated and unrelated to each other, making it difficult for them to see connections across disciplines. In addition, many existing science assessments target rote memorization and algorithmic problem-solving skills. Here, we describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of an activity aimed to help students integrate knowledge across introductory chemistry and biology courses. The activity design and evaluation of students' responses were guided by theFramework for K-12 Science Educationas the understanding of core ideas and crosscutting concepts and the development of scientific practices are essential for students at all levels. In this activity, students are asked to use their understanding of noncovalent interactions to explain (a) why the boiling point differs for two pure substances (chemistry phenomenon) and (b) why temperature and base pair composition affects the stability of DNA (biological phenomenon). The activity was implemented at two different institutions (N= 441) in both introductory chemistry and biology courses. Students' overall performance suggests that they can provide sophisticated responses that incorporate their understanding of noncovalent interactions and energy to explain the chemistry phenomenon, but have difficulties integrating the same knowledge to explain the biological phenomenon. Our findings reinforce the notion that students should be provided with opportunities in the classroom to purposefully practice and support the use and integration of knowledge from multiple disciplines. Students' evaluations of the activity indicated that they found it to be interesting and helpful for making connections across disciplines.

AB Many institutions of higher education will use online teaching in some form in the coming months. Active learning strategies in online classrooms can present new challenges, especially for quiet or shy students, or students who are not in a location where speaking is feasible. Further, development of student science identity, class community, and structure are crucial in the online classroom, especially in times of crisis. I propose one online teaching strategy using what I call "student share-out grids" that is useful for many types of students and promotes community and structure in the online classroom.

AB Distance learning requires the combined use of techniques because it is more complicated to keep the students' attention. This exercise is designed to explain the inactivation of the x-chromosome in humans and is intended to complement the theoretical explanations. It is estimated that it lasts two hours and makes use of different web resources. It is intended for students familiar with the use of BLAST tools.

ID CHROMATOGRAPHIC PURIFICATION; DNA
AB This laboratory experiment describes the production and purification of plasmid DNA for undergraduate biochemistry and biotechnology courses. This experiment performed in a one-week period includes the protocols for plasmid pVAX1-LacZ production in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha cells and subsequent purification of supercoiled pVAX1-LacZ. Firstly, the students use a growth medium that favors the replication of the plasmid resulting in a higher plasmid production during exponential growth. Afterwards, alkaline lysis is done to disrupt the bacterial cells and recover pVAX1-LacZ plasmid. Lastly, they perform the purification of pVAX1-LacZ supercoiled isoform by L-histidine chromatography, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis to characterize the separation of supercoiled isoform from contaminants. The proposed experiment provides an opportunity for students to acquire these skills that are routinely used in biochemistry and biotechnology laboratories.

AB Focused self-directed learning process needs to be promoted at present among graduate medical students in view of the information load and limited time available with them. In this study, comparison of the effect of identifying and correcting the mistakes in a given set of wrong statements with the effect of studying correct statements individually by graduate medical students on their understanding of the topic "Cancer Biology" was carried out. At the end of regular teaching module, students were asked to identify the mistakes in a set of seven incorrect statements and correct them individually without peer consultation. Another set of seven correct statements were also provided to them and were asked to study their significance. The effects on low, medium, and high achievers were evaluated by pre- and post-tests with the same set of Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Mean post-test marks were significantly higher among all the three groups compared to pretest marks for the wrong statements given. For the correct statements, the post-test marks were significantly higher than the pretest marks only for the low and medium achievers. The gain from identifying the mistakes was higher than studying the correct statements for all the three groups of students. Individual correction of errors in statements is a superior active learning process in comparison to the study of correct statements.

AB The computer game Foldit is currently widely used as a biology and biochemistry teaching aid. Herein, we introduce a new feature of Foldit called "custom contests" that allows educators to create puzzles that fit their curriculum. The effectiveness of the custom contests is demonstrated by the use of five distinct custom contests in an upper-level biochemistry class. The new custom contest feature can be implemented in classes ranging from middle school to graduate school to enable educators to best complement their current curriculum.

AB Understanding diamagnetism of oxygenated and paramagnetism of deoxygenated hemoglobin, an important topic in (bio) chemistry for medical students, begins with the understanding of the detailed structure of the oxygen molecule. It continues with a short description of the structures of reactive oxygen species: the singlet form of oxygen, the superoxide, and peroxide anions. The article then describes the high spin and low spin form of the iron ion with its d-orbitals and explains why both forms with different diameters exist in the heme part. At the end, medical applications of the acquired knowledge are presented: the cooperative effect in hemoglobin and the principles of magnetic resonance imagining.

AB Personal interviews were conducted with biochemistry faculty during which they were presented with student performances on a content survey. From these interviews, four themes that reflect faculty responses to the surveys emerged: awareness of student understanding, self-reflection on teaching practice, planned collaboration with colleagues, and emotional reactions. Here, we discuss these themes and their implications for creating conversation designed to promote reflection on biochemistry teaching.

AB It will always remain a goal of an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course to engage students hands-on in a wide range of biochemistry laboratory experiences. In 2006, our research group initiated a project for in silico prediction of enzyme function based only on the 3D coordinates of the more than 3800 proteins of unknown function in the Protein Data Bank, many of which resulted from the Protein Structure Initiative. Students have used the ProMOL plugin to the PyMOL molecular graphics environment along with BLAST, Pfam, and Dali to predict protein functions. As young scientists, these undergraduate research students wanted to see if their predictions were correct and so they developed an approach for in vitro testing of predicted enzyme function that included literature exploration, selection of a suitable assay and the search for commercially available substrates. Over the past two years, a team of faculty members from seven different campuses (California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo, Hope College, Oral Roberts University, Rochester Institute of Technology, St. Mary's University, Ursinus College, and Purdue University) have transferred this approach to the undergraduate biochemistry teaching laboratory as a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience. A series of ten course modules and eight instructional videos have been created () and the group is now expanding these resources, creating assessments and evaluating how this approach helps student to grow as scientists. The focus of this manuscript will be the logistical implications of this transition on campuses that have different cultures, expectations, schedules, and student populations.

AB This graduate-level DNA methods laboratory course is designed to model a discovery-based research project and engages students in both traditional DNA analysis methods and modern recombinant DNA cloning techniques. In the first part of the course, students clone the Drosophila ortholog of a human disease gene of their choosing using Gateway((R)) cloning. In the second part of the course, students examine the expression of their gene of interest in human cell lines by reverse transcription PCR and learn how to analyze data from quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments. The adaptability of the Gateway((R)) cloning system is ideally suited for students to design and create different types of expression constructs to achieve a particular experimental goal (e.g., protein purification, expression in cell culture, and/or subcellular localization), and the genes chosen can be aligned to the research interests of the instructor and/or ongoing research in a department. Student evaluations indicate that the course fostered a genuine excitement for research and in depth knowledge of both the techniques performed and the theory behind them. Our long-term goal is to incorporate this DNA methods laboratory as the foundation for an integrated laboratory sequence for the Master of Science degree program in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Quinnipiac University, where students use the reagents and concepts they developed in this course in subsequent laboratory courses, including a protein methods and cell culture laboratory.

AB Translational science is an emerging field that holds great promise to accelerate the development of novel medical interventions. As the field grows, so does the demand for highly trained biomedical scientists to fill the positions that are being created. Many graduate and postdoctorate training programs do not provide their trainees with sufficient education to take advantage of this growing employment sector. To help better prepare the trainees at the National Institutes of Health for possible careers in translation, we have created the Translational Science Training Program (TSTP). The TSTP is an intensive 2- to 3-day training program that introduces NIH postdoctoral trainees and graduate students to the science and operation of turning basic research discoveries into a medical therapeutic, device or diagnostic, and also exposes them to the variety of career options in translational science. Through a combination of classroom teaching from practicing experts in the various disciplines of translation and small group interactions with pre-clinical development teams, participants in the TSTP gain knowledge that will aid them in obtaining a career in translational science and building a network to make the transition to the field.

AB In 2006, small blocks of flexible curriculum time, termed selectives, were implemented in the Mayo Medical School preclinical curriculum. Selectives permitted students to pursue professional endeavors, such as research, service, and career exploration, in the preclinical years. The purpose of this study was to survey current and former Mayo medical students regarding the impact of selectives on their research interest and productivity. The authors surveyed 377 current and former Mayo Medical School students from the 2004 to 2014 graduating classes, 154 participants (41% response rate) responded to the survey. The classes were grouped into pre- and postselective groups for the comparison studies. Postselective students published significantly more (p = 0.003) and gave significantly more presentations (p = 0.0007) during medical school than preselective students. Thirty-four (72% of the postselective respondents) indicated that selectives had a strong or very strong impact on their current research interest. Respondents spent an average of 4.0 [3.0-5.0] weeks of Selective time on research, resulting in 1.8 [1.4-2.2] publications and 1.8 [1.4-2.2] presentations, which represented 52.5% [40.0-65.0%] and 47.3% [37.1-57.4%] of the students' total medical school publications and presentations, respectively. Flexible selective time during the preclinical years results in significantly more medical student academic productivity. (C) 2015 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

ID GAMES
AB We developed an interactive exercise to teach students how to draw the structures of the 20 standard amino acids and to identify the one-letter abbreviations by modifying the familiar game of Hangman. Amino acid structures were used to represent single letters throughout the game. To provide additional practice in identifying structures, hints to the answers were written in amino acid sentences for the students to translate. Students were required to draw the structure of the corresponding letter they wished to guess on a whiteboard. Each student received a reference sheet of the structures and abbreviations, but was required to draw from memory when guessing a letter. Preassessments and postassessments revealed a drastic improvement in the students' ability to recognize and draw structures from memory. This activity provides a fun, educational game to play in biochemistry discussion sections or during long incubations in biochemistry laboratories.

AB Bacterial viruses, otherwise known as bacteriophage (or phage), are some of the most abundant viruses found in the environment. They can be easily isolated from water or soil and are ideal for use in laboratory classrooms due to their ease of culture and inherent safety. Here, we describe a series of 10 laboratory exercises where students collect, isolate, and purify the genome of an environmental phage. Once the genome has been extracted, students then clone a fragment of their isolated phage genome into a plasmid and analyze its sequence to identify the phage in their original isolate. These exercises have been carefully designed to apply foundational concepts that will expose students to basic skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics.

AB Molecular genetic laboratory exercises can be ineffective due the student's lack of connection to the complex and sequential protocols. In this inquiry-based molecular genetic laboratory exercise, we harness students' fascination with human forensics and provide a real-life scenario using biomolecular techniques to identify "whose blood is on the t-shirt." We use fish blood to create realistic blood stains on clothing and challenge the students to use DNA analyses to clear or implicate suspects. Safety concerns are minimized through the use of fish blood, while maximizing both realism and the likelihood of student success due to fishes' nucleated red blood cells. The goal in designing this laboratory exercise was to create a feasible protocol for large (over 300 students) second year university courses. During two 3 hour laboratory sessions, students learn and apply clean/sterile technique, DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and agarose gel electrophoresis. The students also learn to interpret the resulting gel bands in terms of inclusive or exclusive evidence. Students have consistently ranked this lab as their favorite of five taken as part of a second year Genetics course.

AB Approximately two million students matriculate into American colleges and universities per year. Almost 20% of these students begin taking a series of courses specified by advisers of health preprofessionals. The single most important influence on health profession advisers and on course selection for this huge population of learners is the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), which was last revised in 1991, 10 years before publication of the first draft human genome sequence. In preparation for the 2015 MCAT, there is a broad discussion among stakeholders of how best to revise undergraduate and medical education in the molecular sciences to prepare researchers and doctors to acquire, analyze and use individual genomic and metabolomic data in the coming decades. Getting these changes right is among the most important educational problems of our era. (C) 2012 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 41(1):14, 2013

   implementation; GLP; industry connections
AB The implementation of good laboratory practices (GLPs) is recognized by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries as being critical for ensuring the international acceptability of products. However, as universities and colleges (and research organizations) do not necessarily work under similar constraints, actual laboratory practices vary widely, and students (or employees) are not required to have any exposure to GLP standards and stipulations. This essay makes a case for formally introducing principal investigators, students, and other laboratory personnel to the GLP regime. Many of these practices, while not absolutely required in academic laboratories, could nevertheless facilitate smooth and efficient running of the laboratory and also equip students with the knowledge and experience necessary for a facile transition to an industrial setting.

AB Enzyme purification projects are an excellent way to introduce many aspects of protein biochemistry, but can be difficult to carry out under the constraints of a typical undergraduate laboratory course. We have designed a short laboratory project for the purification and identification of an "unknown" lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme that can fit into a multiproject course without consuming too many laboratory days. The streamlined purification utilizes ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography to give good recovery of LDH with minimal equipment requirements, and can be completed in three laboratory periods of 3-4 hours. As part of this, we have designed a novel, qualitative format for an LDH activity assay that allows students to rapidly screen their column chromatography fractions without the need of a spectrophotometer or plate reader. The analysis phase of the project is question-driven, and can be completed in two laboratory periods. The students must determine which purification technique was most effective by quantifying LDH activity and total protein content at each step of the purification, and then identify their unknown isozyme through agarose gel electrophoresis. This module provides an engaging format for teaching protein biochemistry, with the flexibility to allow an instructor to modify it for their particular curriculum.

AB Diverse biological data may be used to create illustrations of molecules in their cellular context. I describe the scientific results that support a recent textbook illustration of a mitochondrion. The image magnifies a portion of the mitochondrion by one million times, showing the location and form of membranes and individual macromolecules, revealing the molecular basis of its role in energy metabolism and apoptosis. Results from biochemistry, electron microscopy, and X-ray crystallography were used to create the image.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic caused several educational challenges. Conducting laboratory experiments was an uphill task during the pandemic. Here, we developed a low-cost and reliable home-based experimental setup to teach column and thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel granules available at home. Powdered silica gel, prepared by grinding silica gel granules, was used as the stationary phase. Iso-propyl alcohol, purchased from a pharmacy, was diluted with water and used as the mobile phase. A food coloring was chromatographically separated using the designed column. Moreover, TLC plates were prepared using powdered silica gel and a drop of food coloring was separated on TLC plates using the same mobile phase. In the article, we show our experiences by providing methods used to implement this experimental setup. We assume that this experimental setup will be helpful for other universities, research institutes and schools to develop online laboratory curricula to demonstrate basic chromatography techniques required for subjects such as chemistry, biochemistry and biology.

AB We present here two accessible ways for enhanced understanding of complex biological structures and their function in undergraduate Biology and Biochemistry classrooms. These methods can be applied for in-class instruction as well as for remote lessons, as they are cheap, easily available and easy to implement. LEGO (R) bricks and MERGE CUBE based augmented reality can be applied to make three-dimensional representation for any structure available on PDB. We envisage these techniques to be useful for students when visualizing simple stereochemical problems or complex pathway interactions.

AB Every branch of science needs visitors' attention during the poster presentation session at conferences, symposiums, seminars, etc. In particular, participants in the chemistry and biochemistry conference need more visual tools to explain their research work in detail. Presence of smartphones and the ability of 2D barcodes will allow chemical reactions or processes to be shown in the form of a movie, animation or augmented reality (AR). Therefore, the next generation of posters will be more interested in this view. Here, the ability of 2D barcodes or QR codes to help researchers to catch more attention in their research work was presented during a poster presentation session. In this way, the visitors showed positive attitudes to the applicability of such tools. Also, some information including the number of poster visitors and interesting topics in the conference can be collected easily which is useful for the scientific and organizing committee of conferences. As a result, biochemistry conference posters can be presented in new ways, based on animation images or video, to capture the attention of viewers and deepen their understanding of poster concepts.

AB Given the present need for biochemistry and molecular biology educators to transform their courses into an online format, novel methods aimed at promoting student learning and engagement must be considered. Herein, we describe the integration of graphical systems modeling as a tool for introducing biochemistry to secondary-level students. We propose the use of graphic technologies as a way for students to create systems models that describe phenomena of life, such as lactation. Through these endeavors, educators can provide a virtual format for students to continue learning and completing assignments.

AB This article describes the development and assessment of a Nutritional Genomics course, designed to be held in a regular classroom during normal class periods, with few extra costs to the students or the department. The course was run as an upper-level undergraduate and lower-level graduate student course. Student taking the course spent 11 weeks learning and then 4 weeks using various in silico methods to independently characterize genes of interest in the field. During the last 4 weeks of the course, students combined their methods to test a hypothesis they generated about a gene they have not yet studied and completed a final report in the form of a journal article. Two students have published or are in the process of publishing work from their final project. Validated surveys of genetic knowledge given at least 6 months following the course indicated a very high level of genetic knowledge retainment, and favorable attitudes toward genetics testing and medical use of genetics. Finally, self-perceived critical thinking skills were high, and students indicated that they perceived these skills to be gained by their participation in the course. Materials and syllabus provided in the manuscript makes this CURE easily transferrable to other disciplines.

AB "Didn't understand or not fully understand" is the most common situation that students experience when they learn medical biochemistry and molecular biology (MBMB). Therefore, the primary task of teaching MBMB is to help students overcome the difficulties in "conceptual understanding." The core of the solution to these problems lies in the acquisition and application of cognitive skills. The key to applying Ausubel cognitive assimilation theory (A's CAT) is to expand the knowledge capacity of students' cognitive structure through the purposeful "production" and employment of advanced organizers, with which students can replace "rote learning" with "meaningful learning" and ultimately develop an interest in MBMB courses. The results showed that the application of A's CAT did not only encourage the students to use cognitive skills to learn and understand MBMB knowledge and overcome the barrier to learning that results from the characteristics of the MBMB course, but also expanded and deepened the MBMB course contents. As a branch of learning theory, A's CAT provides practical methods for the several hypotheses of learning theory. Among these, the advanced organizer strategy realizes the organization and reorganization of new knowledge; the progressive differentiation strategy reduces the difficulty of complex and abstract knowledge; the implementation of the advanced organizer strategy and integrative reconciliation strategy forms the concept map. Taken together, the application of A's CAT includes cognitive strategy and metacognitive strategy when the cognitive process is conducted in a meaningful way. More importantly, application of A's CAT guides students to participate in active learning and builds "scaffolding" for the teaching/learning MBMB of student-centered goals.

AB Grades in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses are distributed under the assumption that high-performing students have a strong understanding of the material. Similarly, the STEM education literature often presents exam performance as equivalent to understanding. Despite these assumptions, we have little knowledge regarding student thinking in relation to exam scores. To investigate this relationship, we asked undergraduate students to complete a series of written and verbal tasks. Twenty-two participants were presented with biology questions and were instructed to write exam-like responses along with their thought process. More than half of the participants then took part in retrospective interviews. We graded the exam-like responses to award a performance score and coded the entirety of participants' writing for their understanding. We found a discrepancy between performance and understanding for over one quarter of our data. Furthermore, interviews allowed for a more complete picture of participant understanding than written responses. These results contribute to calls for re-evaluating our course assessments and for questioning the understanding those assessments value.

AB Computational techniques have great potential to improve the teaching-learning. In this work, we used a computational strategy to visualize three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and DNA and help the student to comprehend biochemistry concepts such as protein structure and function, substrate, and inhibitors as well as DNA structural features. The practical classes included tutorials to be done in the computer using structures from Protein Data Bank and a free 3D structure visualization software, Swiss PDB Viewer. The activity was done with 76 students from biology and pharmacy undergraduate courses. Questionnaires were administered to evaluate the knowledge regarding specific biochemistry contents before and after the activity and the opinion of the students. An overall increased percentage of correct answers post-classes (75.91%) were observed in comparison to pre-classes (35.53%). All the students indicated that it could contribute to the learning of DNA and protein structure contents; approximately 90% stated that it enables structures visualization or makes the learning and understanding easier. Therefore, the strategy has shown to be effective, allowing the contextualization of biochemistry themes and may complement theoretical classes.

AB This article describes a laboratory exercise designed for undergraduate students in the subject of Regulation of cell proliferation which allows the students to carry out a research experiment in an important field such as cell cycle control, and to be introduced to a widely used technique in molecular biology laboratories such as the western blot. The cell cycle is regulated by the succession of cyclin-CDK kinase activities. Activation and inactivation of different cyclin-CDK complexes depend on the control of their positive and negative regulators, cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs), respectively. In this experiment, fluctuations in the level of mitotic cyclin Clb2 and CDK inhibitor Sic1 throughout the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are analyzed, particularly in the context of the control of mitotic exit and Start, two of the most important cell cycle transitions. In order to do this, a cdc15 mutant strain is used to block cells in telophase and, upon release from this blocking, the variation in the levels of Clb2 and Sic1 proteins are analyzed by western blot. Progress along the cell cycle is also evaluated by microscopic analysis of cell morphology and nuclear staining. This practical illustrates the experimental basis of theoretical concepts worked in the classroom and it is a good framework for an in-depth discussion of these concepts based on experimental data analysis.

AB Laboratory exercise is helpful for medical students to understand the basic principles of molecular biology and to learn about the practical applications of molecular biology. We have designed a lab course on molecular biology about the determination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human REV3 gene, the product of which is a subunit of DNA polymerase and SNPs in this gene are associated with altered susceptibility to cancer. This newly designed experiment is composed of three parts, including genomic DNA extraction, gene amplification by PCR, and genotyping by RFLP. By combining these activities, the students are not only able to learn a series of biotechniques in molecular biology, but also acquire the ability to link the learned knowledge with practical applications. This comprehensive experiment will help the medical students improve the conceptual understanding of SNP and the technical understanding of SNP detection.

AB This work presents a three-dimensional (3D) modeling exercise for undergraduate students in chemistry and health sciences disciplines, focusing on a protein-group linked to immune system regulation. Specifically, the exercise involves molecular modeling and structural analysis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) proteins, both wild type and mutant. The structure of the tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor (TNF-R1) is also briefly explored. TNF and TNF-R1 play major roles in maintaining human immune-system homeostasis. Upon binding with TNFR-1, the TNF can activate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), eventually resulting in apoptosis or cell death. These essential features of the clinically relevant TNF family is explored within the frame work of a readily adaptable tutorial.

AB It is often difficult for students to develop an intuition about molecular processes, which occur in a realm far different from day-to-day life. For example, thermal fluctuations take on hurricane-like proportions at the molecular scale. Students need a way to visualize realistic depictions of molecular processes to appreciate them. To this end, we have developed a simplified graphical interface to the widely used molecular visualization and analysis tool Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) called VMD lite. We demonstrate the use of VMD lite through a module on diffusion and the hydrophobic effect as they relate to membrane formation. Trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations, which students can interact with freely, illustrate the dynamical behavior of lipid molecules and water. VMD lite was tested by approximate to 70 students with overall positive reception. Remaining deficiencies in conceptual understanding were noted, however, and the module has been revised in response.

AB We describe a structured inquiry laboratory exercise that examines transcriptional regulation of the NOS2 gene under conditions that simulate the inflammatory response in macrophages. Using quantitative PCR and the comparative C-T method, students are able determine whether transcriptional activation of NOS2 occurs and to what degree. The exercise is aimed at second year undergraduates who possess basic knowledge of gene expression events. It requires only 4-5 hr of dedicated laboratory time and focuses on use of the primary literature, data analysis, and interpretation. Importantly, this exercise provides a mechanism to introduce the concept of differential gene expression and provides a starting point for development of more complex guided or open inquiry projects for students moving into upper level molecular biology, immunology, and biochemistry course work.

ID BENEFITS
AB Undergraduate research clearly enriches the educational development of participating students, but these experiences are limited by the inherent inefficiency of the standard one student-one mentor model for undergraduate research. Group-effort applied research (GEAR) was developed as a strategy to provide substantial numbers of undergraduates with meaningful research experiences. The GEAR curriculum delivers concept-driven lecture material and provides hands-on training in the context of an active research project from the instructor's laboratory. Because GEAR is structured as a class, participating students benefit from intensive, supervised research training that involves a built-in network of peer support and abundant contact with faculty mentors. The class format also ensures a relatively standardized and consistent research experience. Further-more, meaningful progress toward a research objective can be achieved more readily with GEAR than with the traditional one student-one mentor model of undergraduate research because sporadic mistakes by individuals in the class are overshadowed by the successes of the group as a whole. Three separate GEAR classes involving three distinct research projects have been offered to date. In this article, we provide an overview of the GEAR format and review some of the recurring themes for GEAR instruction. We propose GEAR can serve as a template to expand student opportunities for life science research without sacrificing the quality of the mentored research experience.

AB In this laboratory module, introductory biochemistry students are exposed to two-dimensional 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance of glycerophospholipids (GPLs). Working in groups of three, students enzymatically synthesized and purified a variety of 2-acyl lyso GPLs. The structure of the 2-acyl lyso GPL was verified using 1H-correlation spectroscopy. Students scored significantly higher on an assessment of NMR knowledge after having participated in this lab module and in comparison to a similar cohort who did not participate. Inaddition, student confidence in their NMR knowledge and abilities increased 62% following the module and correlated with their ability to apply their NMR knowledge. Based on these results, the laboratory module was very effective at providing students with a more extensive understanding of the underlying concepts of NMR as a tool for structural determination.

DE Primer3; primer design; real-time PCR; SYBR (R) Green
AB Real-time PCR (quantitative PCR or qPCR) has become the preferred method for validating results obtained from assays which measure gene expression profiles. The process uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), coupled with fluorescent chemistry, to measure variations in transcriptome levels between samples. The four most commonly used fluorescent chemistries are SYBR (R) Green dyes and TaqMan (R), Molecular Beacon or Scorpion probes. SYBR (R) Green is very simple to use and cost efficient. As SYBR (R) Green dye binds to any double-stranded DNA product, its success depends greatly on proper primer design. Many types of online primer design software are available, which can be used free of charge to design desirable SYBR (R) Green-based qPCR primers. This laboratory exercise is intended for those who have a fundamental background in PCR. It addresses the basic fluorescent chemistries of real-time PCR, the basic rules and pitfalls of primer design, and provides a step-by-step protocol for designing SYBR (R) Green-based primers with free, online software.

AB With the global increase of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, there is an urgent need for new methods of tackling the issue. Genomic analysis of bacterial strains can help to understand their virulence and antibiotic resistance profile. Bioinformatic skills are in great demand across the biological sciences. We designed a workshop that allows university students to learn the process of genome assembly using command-line tools within a virtual machine on a Linux operating system. We use Illumina and Nanopore short and long-read raw sequences to reveal the advantages and disadvantages of short, long, and hybrid assembly methods. The workshop teaches how to assess read and assembly quality, perform genome annotation, and analyze pathogenicity, antibiotic and phage resistance. The workshop is intended for a five-week teaching period and is concluded by a student poster presentation assessment.

AB Outreach activities give high school students an opportunity to better understand the techniques and strategies used by researchers. Here is an experience with high school students designed to familiarize them with genetic methodologies. Students have been challenged to discover whether restaurant beef burgers are made with female or male beef. This represents a didactic way to introduce students to genetic traceability methodologies and also to demonstrate the usefulness of these methodologies in relation to food safety and, more importantly, in sustaining consumer confidence. The exercise is planned to be conducted in a one-day laboratory session.

AB Southern blot analysis is an important molecular biology technique for identifying a specific sequence in DNA samples. Although it is no longer used extensively in recent years, the steps and underlying principles of Southern blot are applicable to modern biology. High sensitivity and limited background are keys to successful Southern blots, whereas obtaining good quality and quantity of genomic DNA as starting materials and detecting a single/low copy target sequence in the genome can be challenging. To ensure student success in performing the technique for the first time, a modified "plasmid-to-plasmid" Southern blot was implemented to confirm the presence of grape nucleotide-binding site (nbs) sequences in cloned plasmids like those described previously. The plasmid DNA and a control plasmid, pSCA7 (T1-T3-W6) containing a known grape nbs sequence, were digested with restriction enzymes, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA band corresponding to the nbs sequence of the pSCA7 (T1-T3-W6) was extracted from the gel for PCR digoxigenin (DIG) probe synthesis. At the same time, the cloned plasmid DNA and its digested DNA fragments were blotted from the gel onto nylon membranes to be hybridized with the DIG probe followed by the detection for nbs sequences. Students successfully performed Southern blots to confirm the presence of nbs sequences in their cloned plasmids and wrote up the results following the format of scientific research papers. They learned the principles and applications of Southern blot and gained hands-on experience with associated techniques.

AB Learning synthetic biology is often seen as a far distant possibility, restricted to those who have the privilege of an academic career. We propose a student-centered discussion group around synthetic biology, aimed at people from high school onwards with different backgrounds to interact and learn about synthetic biology. We developed a 14-week long program with three modules: "Leveling," "Introducing," and "Discussion." By completing the first two modules, the members should be more comfortable with biological names, structures, concepts, and techniques. The modules developed are available in Portuguese, Spanish, and English via the Open Lab Idea Real website () and can be used to implement the Club either in place or virtually around the world. We put it to practice at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) creating the Club named BioSin. There are programs such as the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition focused on disseminating synthetic biology. Although iGEM is one fantastic way of learning about synthetic biology, there is a high cost. Because of that, a study and discussion Club is a tool to spread knowledge and engage with the study area.

AB Medical students tend to have difficulties in developing a holistic view of metabolic pathway and hormone regulation. To address this issue, an interactive activity was implemented for first-year medical students at the School of Medicine, University of Minho, Portugal. Students' previous knowledge on metabolic pathways was evaluated by a pre-test followed by an interactive activity. In the supervised activity, students were challenged to elaborate a diagrammatic representation regarding enzymes, co-factors, and hormonal metabolic regulation in early fasting during the night, as well as in well-fed conditions. The activity was concluded with a post-test to determine the students' learning gains and a few days later students were evaluated by a final exam. Afterwards, students evaluated the activity by filling a questionnaire. Results from four different cohorts showed that the activity resulted in significant learning gains, particularly favoring students who have less prior knowledge. The comparison between the pre-test and the final exam also revealed significant learning gains for low achievers students. On the questionnaires, the majority of the students rated the activity as good or very good. Students agreed that this activity promotes: (a) reactivation of previous knowledge; (b) a better understanding of the interconnections between the metabolic pathways; (c) the application of learned concepts in real scenarios; and (d) sharing knowledge with peers. This study describes an active, unpretentious, and easily implemented activity available for early medical and biochemical curricula.

AB The benefits and long-term effects of extracurricular scientific research on undergraduate students in many countries have been intensively investigated, but it remains obscure for Chinese medical students. In this study, we investigated the outcome of 60 medical students who have participated in extracurricular scientific research at Jinan University Medical School over a period of 7 years (2011-2018). The results revealed that these students have contributed to 31 biomedical science articles in reputable academic journals, as first- or co-authors. Furthermore, they also independently procured various funding based on their research achievements, and smaller awards for achievements in conferences and competitions. Assessment of the grade point average score of these students revealed that conducting extracurricular scientific research did not affect their routine medical study and exam grades (P>0.05). The students benefited from participating in extracurricular research, by acquiring the ability to think scientifically and enhancing their communication skills. In addition, the medical students were motivated to enlist for postgraduate studies so that they could further embark in scientific research. In sum, Chinese medical students are capable of participating in scientific research and make a significant contribution to science.

AB Campus closures in Spring 2020 required rapid transition to online course delivery. Fall 2020 has similar needs and expectations. The Advanced Topics in Molecular Biology Techniques course, designed for upper division undergraduate and graduate students, uses a "journal club" format. The journal club format includes practice-based learning and provides student choice. Examples from graduate students effectively model the expectations using near-peer instruction. Teaching in the time of COVID-19 requires openness to new ideas and modifications to previous approaches. We were able to move the course online with little interruption.

AB In 2018, to help undergraduate medical students strengthen their self-learning and scientific research skills, we introduced an instructional model that combined literature-based learning with experimental design. We tested this model on the molecular biology class at Tongji University. In the first step of the model, a topic is chosen, and students find, read, and evaluate scientific papers in groups and deliver presentations. In the second step, they design scientific experiments in groups and discuss their proposed experiments in class, which is to be followed by further experimental verification in the lab course. This entire activity was given 20% weightage in the final score. The model led to better student-centered teaching and self-directed learning according to quantitative and qualitative assessment. Students showed great interest in literature and research. They enjoyed group work and gained experience in organization and presentation. Apart from a significant increase in final score, assessment data from students indicated that they were satisfied with this teaching model and considered it a positive experience. Looking at the positive impact of the literature-based learning and experiment design model, we support its continued use for teaching molecular biology to undergraduate medical students.

AB Medical statistics is one of the most important courses for medical students. It requires tremendous practice opportunities to fully master the learning contents. The in-class lectures inevitably reduce students' practice opportunities and the possibility of getting timely feedbacks. More importantly, a passive learning experience made by traditional class may eliminate any sense of autonomy or competence in learners. Thus, the present study attempted to redesign medical statistics course in a Chinese medical school by using the flipped classroom approach and examined the effectiveness of this approach on learning interest, self-regulated learning ability, and academic performance. The results showed both learning interest and academic performance experienced significant increase within the traditional class and flipped class; however, the changes in the flipped class were significantly larger than the traditional class. As for self-regulated learning, it significantly increased only within the flipped class, no significant change was found within the traditional class. The change of self-regulated learning in the flipped class was not significantly different from the traditional class. In general, the effectiveness of flipped classroom approach for medical statistics was verified. Further studies should examine whether the flipped classroom approach for medical statistics is benefit to self-regulated learning or metacognition.

AB Carbohydrates, or in strictly chemical terms, polyhydroxy-aldehydes or ketones represent enormous structural diversity in terms of the arrangement of atoms in space, resulting in hundreds of stereoisomers. Although the chemical properties of most stereoisomers may not be very different, their metabolic fate and utilization in biological systems is significantly different and known to influence the overall carbohydrate metabolism. This dictates the importance of understanding the structures of various stereochemical structures for a biochemist. At graduate level teaching, it is really a challenging task to correlate, connect, and recall all the structures. Conventional teaching methods and standard textbook illustrations seldom enable the learners and instructors to sustain the information for a prolonged period. We, in this article, present a unique approach and introduce sigma notation rules for the correlation of stereochemistry of carbohydrates in order to enhance the understanding of stereochemical structures.

AB Biochemistry textbooks often provide a disconnected, highly mathematical, and decontextualized treatment of thermodynamic and kinetic principles, which renders topics like protein folding difficult to teach. This is concerning given that graduates entering careers, like the pharmaceutical industry, must be able to apply such knowledge and related research methods to solve biochemistry research problems. Thus, it is essential that instructors have strategies to incorporate research methods and representations to help students understand the source of such scientific knowledge. Therefore, the goal of our work is to examine expert practice and use the findings to identify instructional strategies to incorporate more cutting-edge research and authentic ways of knowing into science classrooms and textbooks. Toward this goal, we examined how four scientists explain protein folding and dynamics research, focusing on the interaction of spoken language and representations, including gesture. Our analysis indicates that experts employ multiple representations and research methods to communicate how evidence can be used to understand phenomena. In contrast, textbooks explain what is known but seldom use representations to explain how it is known. Based on our findings, we suggest implications for instruction, including the design of textbooks, as well as potential instructional strategies to incorporate discussion of experimental methods and interpretation of representations during classroom activities.

AB Plants and plant products are key to the survival of life on earth. Despite this fact, the significance of plant biochemistry is often underrepresented in science curricula. We designed an innovative laboratory activity to engage students in learning about the biochemical properties of natural polymers produced by plants. The focus of the hands-on activity is on mucilages and gums, which contain complex polysaccharides that have applications in industry. The 1.5-h activity is organized into three laboratory exercises. It begins with a demonstration of the water absorption property of seed coat mucilage upon hydration of seeds from psyllium, a plant that is grown commercially for mucilage production. The second exercise involves microscopy of a variety of plant seeds stained with ruthenium red dye to visualize pectin polysaccharides of the seed mucilage. Students learn about phenotypic variation among plant species and how the seed coat mucilage is beneficial to keep seeds hydrated during germination. The third exercise highlights an industrial application of plant gums as adhesives. The students prepare edible glue made with gum arabic, a type of plant polymer from the dried exudate of the Acacia plant. This three-part activity has been implemented in conjunction with a Girls Researching Our World (GROW) summer workshop for sixth to eighth graders over a 4-year period. It may be adapted as a laboratory activity for students of all ages, for example, to enhance biochemistry education for high-school students or undergraduate non-majors.

AB We have developed a laboratory project in which students prepare liposomes, expose them to hyperosmotic and hypoosmotic solutions, and follow the resulting shrinking and swelling (respectively) with laser light scattering. Each light intensity transient can be fit to an exponential decline or rise, with the decay constant (k) and the amplitude (Delta V-max) being indirectly related to the kinetics and thermodynamics (respectively) of transmembrane osmotic flux. Students vary the experimental system by changing the types and concentrations of osmolytes such as alcohols, amides, and salts. Students then compare how these changes alter the rate and extent of osmotic flux.

AB Laboratory reports written in the style of a standard scientific article are commonly used to assess student learning in biochemistry laboratory courses. While most students can complete the Materials and Methods or Results sections successfully, many have difficulty with the Introduction and Discussion. They fail to place their data in a larger experimental context or to compare their results to those previously published. To address this issue in a laboratory course focusing on l-lactate dehydrogenase, a new exercise was introduced that was designed 1) to provide more background information about l-lactate dehydrogenase; 2) to give students additional experience in using PubMed and Web of Science to locate specific papers about l-lactate dehydrogenase; 3) to introduce the major bioinformatics databases at the National Center for Biological Information, ExPASy (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), BRENDA (Braunschweig Enzyme Database), and the Protein Data Bank; 4) to allow students to recover detailed information about l-lactate dehydrogenases; and 5) to provide practice in reading a research article that is similar to what they do in the lab. The students completed a data sheet summarizing these activities and then prepared three laboratory reports. The lab reports improved over the course of the semester and were qualitatively better than in past years. The materials developed for this laboratory course can be adapted to similar projects that use another protein as a model system. They could also be modified for use in Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences or research projects for undergraduate or graduate students.

AB An assessment was developed using entries from the macromolecular Crystallographic Information File that was given to students in an upper level bioinformatics class at the end of the semester during a 21/2 hour time period. Although all students completed the same questions, they were assessed on an individual protein they had worked on during the semester in the situated learning of the classroom as they completed computer-based tutorials and exercises using internet sources. The students' difficulties with the external representation of their protein were: not following directions, not understanding how to use the computational software, or a lack of knowledge about their protein. The students also were required to answer questions that required biochemical knowledge. The difficulties they experienced during the assessment can be attributed to factors, such as, their reasoning ability, understanding of the concepts, and the external representations of their protein.

AB Several major organizations have recommended revisions to mathematics requirements for biology majors. To determine whether these changes would benefit future biologists, we investigated mathematics use in research biology. We surveyed prominent journals in high and low math-use areas for articles referencing the use of quantitative methods. In addition, we conducted a large-scale survey of research biologists within these fields about their use of, and training in, mathematics and statistics. We then performed follow-up interviews with a purposeful sample of respondents. Our results indicate that biologists need a base in descriptive and inferential statistics and mathematical modeling, including some concepts from calculus, focused on conceptual understanding rather than computational accuracy, followed by differentiated programs of study in mathematics and statistics, depending on intended discipline within biology. Comparison of our findings with the recommended requirements from major stakeholder groups indicates some alignment but also some discrepancies.

AB Aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) composed of polypropylene glycol and carbohydrates, two benign substances are proposed to separate two food colorants (E122 and E133). ABS are promising extractive platforms, particularly for biomolecules, due to their aqueous and mild nature (pH and temperature), reduced environmental impact and processing costs. Another major aspect considered, particularly useful in downstream processing, is the tuning ability for the extraction and purification of these systems by a proper choice of the ABS components. In this work, our intention is to show the concept of ABS as an alternative and volatile organic solvent-free tool to separate two different biomolecules in a simple way, so simple that teachers can effectively adopt it in their classes to explain the concept of bioseparation processes. Informative documents and general information about the preparation of binodal curves and their use in the partition of biomolecules is available in this work to be used by teachers in their classes. In this sense, the students use different carbohydrates to build ABS, then study the partition of two food color dyes (synthetic origin), thus evaluating their ability on the separation of both food colorants. Through these experiments, the students get acquainted with ABS, learn how to determine solubility curves and perform extraction procedures using colorant food additives, that can also be applied in the extraction of various (bio)molecules.

AB The deployment of molecular biology techniques for diagnosis and research in Nigeria is faced with a number of challenges, including the cost of equipment and reagents coupled with the dearth of personnel skilled in the procedures and handling of equipment. Short molecular biology training workshops were conducted at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), to improve the knowledge and skills of laboratory personnel and academics in health, research, and educational facilities. Five-day molecular biology workshops were conducted annually between 2011 and 2014, with participants drawn from health, research facilities, and the academia. The courses consisted of theoretical and practical sessions. The impact of the workshops on knowledge and skill acquisition was evaluated by pre- and post-tests which consisted of 25 multiple choice and other questions. Sixty-five participants took part in the workshops. The mean knowledge of molecular biology as evaluated by the pre- and post-test assessments were 8.4 (95% CI 7.6-9.1) and 13.0 (95 CI 11.9-14.1), respectively. The mean post-test score was significantly greater than the mean pre-test score (p<0.0001). The five-day molecular biology workshop significantly increased the knowledge and skills of participants in molecular biology techniques.

AB Fundamental concepts in biochemistry important for drug design often lack connection to the macroscopic world and can be difficult for students to grasp, particularly those in introductory science courses at the high school and college level. Educational research has shown that multisensory teaching facilitates learning, but teaching at the high school and college level is almost exclusively limited to the visual and auditory senses. This approach neglects the lifetime of experience our students bring to the classroom in the form of taste perception and makes our teaching less supportive of those with sensory impairment. In this article, we outline a novel guided-inquiry activity that utilizes taste perception for a series of natural and artificial sweetener solutions to introduce the concepts of substrate affinity and selectivity in the context of drug design. The findings from this study demonstrate clear gains in student knowledge, as well as an increase in enthusiasm for the fields of biochemistry and drug design.

AB A laboratory exercise was designed to illustrate how physical stimuli such as temperature and light are sensed and processed by bacteria to elaborate adaptive responses. In particular, we use the well-characterized Des pathway of Bacillus subtilis to show that temperature modulates gene expression, resulting ultimately in modification of the levels of unsaturated fatty acids required to maintain proper membrane fluidity at different temperatures. In addition, we adapt recent findings concerning the modulation by light of traits related to virulence such as motility and biofilm formation in the chemotropic bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii. Beyond the theoretical background that this activity provides regarding sensing of environmental stimuli, the experimental setup includes approaches derived from classic genetics, microbiology, and biochemistry.

AB The rationale for this mandatory, guided online e-journal exercise is to foster the ability of students to independently read medical and scientific literature in a critical manner and to integrate journal reading with their basic science knowledge. After a lecture on oxidative phosphorylation, students were assigned to read an article on brown adipose tissue published in New England Journal of Medicine and were guided to analyze the article by answering online questions. After two iterations, student surveys about the project, its key pedagogical features, and ways to improve it suggest that the students perceived these exercises as active learning, which is clinically relevant and built on their course material. Furthermore, students agreed that the e-journal project was useful for learning how to read an article, for reviewing the material learned in class, and for promoting evidence-based medicine. This online e-journal exercise models some aspects students will experience as future physicians, where it is essential to keep up with literature and extract relevant information on a tight physician's schedule. This study demonstrated the usefulness of guided e-journal exercises as a simple effective active teaching tool for preclinical medical students, which can also be used for prehealth undergraduate programs.

AB Over the past 20 years, the biological sciences have increasingly incorporated chemistry, physics, computer science, and mathematics to aid in the development and use of mathematical models. Such combined approaches have been used to address problems from protein structure-function relationships to the workings of complex biological systems. Computer simulations of molecular events can now be accomplished quickly and with standard computer technology. Also, simulation software is freely available for most computing platforms, and online support for the novice user is ample. We have therefore created a molecular dynamics laboratory module to enhance undergraduate student understanding of molecular events underlying organismal phenotype. This module builds on a previously described project in which students use site-directed mutagenesis to investigate functions of conserved sequence features in members of a eukaryotic protein kinase family. In this report, we detail the laboratory activities of a MD module that provide a complement to phenotypic outcomes by providing a hypothesis-driven and quantifiable measure of predicted structural changes caused by targeted mutations. We also present examples of analyses students may perform. These laboratory activities can be integrated with genetics or biochemistry experiments as described, but could also be used independently in any course that would benefit from a quantitative approach to protein structure-function relationships.

AB Providing students with assignments that focus on critical thinking is an important part of their scientific and intellectual development. However, as class sizes increase, so does the grading burden, prohibiting many faculty from incorporating critical thinking assignments in the classroom. In an effort to continue to provide our students with meaningful critical thinking exercises, we implemented a novel group-centered, problem-based testing scheme. We wanted to assess how performing critical thinking problem sets as group work compares to performing the sets as individual work, in terms of student attitudes and learning outcomes. During two semesters of our recombinant DNA course, students had the same lecture material and similar assessments. In the Fall semester, student learning was assessed by two collaborative take-home exams, followed immediately by individual, closed-book in-class exams on the same content, as well as a final cumulative exam. Student teams on the take-home exams were instructor-assigned, and each team turned in one collaborative exam. In the Spring semester, the control group of students were required to turn in their own individual take-home exams, followed by the in-class exams and final cumulative exam. For the majority of students, learning outcomes were met, regardless of whether they worked in teams. In addition, collaborative learning was favorably received by students and grading was reduced for instructors. These data suggest that group-centered, problem-based learning is a useful model for achievement of student learning outcomes in courses where it would be infeasible to provide feedback on individual critical thinking assignments due to grading volume.

AB Academic staff at universities have become concerned about the decrease in student attendance at lectures and the implication of this on student achievement and learning. Few studies have measured actual lecture attendance in a coherent or comprehensive way. The aim of this study was to measure actual lecture attendance of students over two year levels enrolled in two separate science disciplines, biochemistry and pharmacology. The study further sought to determine the factors that influence lecture attendance. Attendance at lectures in four units of study was monitored over a 12-week semester. Attendance at lectures decreased over the semester and was lower at early morning lectures (8 A.M.; 9 A.M.). A questionnaire surveying students about their preparation for lectures, their compensation for missed lectures and the factors influencing their nonattendance was administered at the end of the semester. Students reported that the major factors influencing their attendance at lectures related to timetable issues and the quality of lecturing. If students missed lectures, the majority read the lecture notes and listened to the online recordings. The availability of online recordings of lectures was not a major influence on attendance at lectures. In three of the four units studied there was no correlation between self-reported lecture attendance and exam performance. The results of the study indicate that universities should dedicate more resources to timetabling and to supporting staff to improve the quality of their lectures.

AB Biological systems, from the molecular to the ecological, involve dynamic interaction networks. To examine student thinking about networks we used graphical responses, since they are easier to evaluate for implied, but unarticulated assumptions. Senior college level molecular biology students were presented with simple molecular level scenarios; surprisingly, most students failed to articulate the basic assumptions needed to generate reasonable graphical representations; their graphs often contradicted their explicit assumptions. We then developed a tiered Socratic tutorial based on leading questions designed to provoke metacognitive reflection. The activity is characterized by leading questions (prompts) designed to provoke meta-cognitive reflection. When applied in a group or individual setting, there was clear improvement in targeted areas. Our results highlight the promise of using graphical responses and Socratic prompts in a tutorial context as both a formative assessment for students and an informative feedback system for instructors, in part because graphical responses are relatively easy to evaluate for implied, but unarticulated assumptions.

AB For close to 2 years, we have witnessed the impacts of the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic on research at several different levels. Among the list, limited access to laboratory-based training for undergraduate students prevented this cohort from gaining exposure to the realities of a research laboratory at a critical time in training when they may have found motivation in this area as a career. COVID exposed a weakness in our training pipeline; an extreme dependency on face-to-face training that threatened to create a void in the research talent needed to replenish the scientific community every year. In the classroom, we witnessed a revolution of e-learning based approaches that could be rapidly implemented based on existing footprints. Out of necessity, our laboratory developed and implemented an e-learning model of an undergraduate peer mentor network that provides a knowledge and experience exchange platform between students with different levels of research experience. Implementation of the platform was to aid students with gaining knowledge in multiple aspects of scientific research and hands-on work in a research laboratory. The collaboration between the students of the network was aimed at not only advancing the theoretical and practical research experience, but also at developing feedback implementation and practicing "soft skills" critical for teamwork and leadership. Herein, we present an overview of the model along with survey responses of the students participating in the peer mentor network. We have found that peer delivery of practical benchwork both via scientific presentations and visualized experiments, reduced the time of training and the amount of staff assistance needed when students returned to the bench. Furthermore, this model accelerated student independence in laboratory work and increased research interest overall. In summary, the model of a peer mentor network has the potential to serve as a training platform and as a customized tool, supplementing research laboratory training at the undergraduate level beyond the pandemic.

TI A field guide for implementing a flipped classroom
SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
DE field guide; flipped classroom; pedagogy
ID POSTER SESSIONS; PRESENTATIONS; BIOCHEMISTRY; PERFORMANCE
AB The way flipped classrooms are perceived and even practiced by teachers is sometimes approximate. For instance, while the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed many universities to adopt distance learning, flipped classrooms have often been mentioned as a solution in that context. This inducement maintains a confusion between flipped classrooms and distance learning that might be detrimental for students and teachers. Moreover, embarking on a new pedagogical practice such as flipped classroom could be intimidating and time-consuming for the newcomer teacher. For these reasons, this article aims to share some tips for implementing a flipped classroom, with examples from biology and biochemistry. Based on our experiences but also on the current scientific literature, we structured these advise around three phases: preparation, implementation, and follow-up. In the preparation phase, we advise planning early to invert time in class and outside the classroom, but also to say it explicitly, as well as to identify (or optionally create) resources for students to learn in autonomy. In the implementation phase, we suggest to (i) be explicit in the acquisition of knowledge and foster students' autonomy; (ii) explore active learning in class; (iii) develop cooperation and sharing skills; and (iv) differentiate teaching practices to adapt to student needs. Lastly, in the follow-up phase, we propose to (i) evaluate both student learning and the pedagogical setting; (ii) take care of the logistics and the teacher's posture; (iii) document the flipped classroom, and (iv) share the teaching experience.

AB The limited capabilities of teaching laboratories, combined with an increasing number of students enrolled in university, require constant augmentation of instructional approaches. By enhancing laboratory demonstrations with digital technology, these structural issues can be addressed while at the same time enhancing student understanding and learning. Our case study focuses on the fermentation lab part of the Reaction Equilibria and Thermodynamics (RET) module, a first-year chemical engineering course at the University of Birmingham. Video demonstrations were used to introduce students to the laboratory set-ups and walk them through each step and technique. The video demonstrations allowed the students to attend the in-person lab sessions having established knowledge and understanding of the processes involved and the outcomes desired, which decreased the burden on the facilities and the staff. A knowledge-based quiz and a student survey conducted at the end of the module showed that the pre-lab videos encouraged more active participation in the laboratory sessions and reinforced learning. Approximately 70% of the students polled in the first survey conducted within this project felt more confident going into the laboratory sessions after watching the pre-lab videos and attempting the knowledge quiz, while 92% of the students polled in the second survey judged the pre-lab video sessions as beneficial to them. Overall, the teaching method has the potential to improve student participation and access, boost confidence and learning, and provided a more structured and flexible approach to laboratory learning outcomes.

ID VISION; TOOL
AB The need for changing how science is taught and the expansion of undergraduate research experiences is essential to foster critical thinking in the Natural Sciences. Most faculty research programs only involve a small number of upper-level undergraduate students each semester. The course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) model enables more students to take ownership over an independent project and experience authentic research. Further, by creating projects that fit into a curriculum's learning goals and student-oriented outcomes, departments help strengthen critical thinking skills in the classroom. Here, we report on the incorporation of a synthetic biology CURE into a mid-level cellular biology course and two advanced level genetics/molecular biology courses. Synthetic biology involves systematic engineering of novel organisms, such as bacteria and plants, to work as functional devices to solve problems in medicine, agriculture, and manufacturing. The value of synthetic biology and its ultimate utility as a teaching tool relies on reusable, standard genetic parts that can be interchanged using common genetic engineering principles. This Synthetic biology CURE effectively achieves five essential goals: (1) a sense of project ownership; (2) self-efficacy: mastery of a manageable number of techniques; (3) increased tolerance for obstacles through challenging research; (4) increased communication skills; and (5) a sense of belonging in a larger scientific community. Based upon our student assessment data, we demonstrate that this course-based synthetic biology laboratory engages students directly in an authentic research experience and models important elements of collaboration, discovery, iteration, and critical thinking.

AB As biologists accumulate or encounter increasingly large and complex data sets, our field creates the need for students to develop skills in data exploration and visualization. Many biology courses lack the time for students to develop the skills needed to parse complex datasets and visualize them appropriately. We developed a new upper-level undergraduate biology course to focused on data exploration and communication without requiring previous coding experience. We emphasized data visualization principles and best practices and taught students how to manage and visualize data via Tableau and R. We also explored scientific ethics, how to refute misinformation, and inequities that can occur in data collection and usage.

AB Biochemistry is a subject that is essential to understand the molecular basis of a disease, its diagnosis, and prognosis. However, study of biochemistry in dentistry at the undergraduate level is considered to be much teacher-oriented and the students show a lackluster attitude toward the subject. This questionnaire study is carried out to understand the perception of dental students in studying biochemistry and its relevance in dental practice. A pre-set questionnaire was sent to Bachelor of Dental Surgery students from first to final year and the responses were recorded. Although students are positive about liking biochemistry as a theory subject, still many are wary of the detailed study of complex reactions and metabolic pathways, which hampers the extensive study of the subject and its application in clinical practice.

AB Gel electrophoresis (GE) is the most preferred and adapted technique for the separation and identification of biological molecules like proteins/peptides and nucleic acids from diverse types of organisms. All over the world, researchers, educators, and students aspiring to work in biochemistry and molecular biology disciplines use the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) technique for resolving proteins/nucleic acids for understanding the structure and function of any cell. A simple PAGE technique requires a wide range of chemicals/reagents along with a well-equipped and well-spaced laboratory. We have developed a compact and impeccable mobile electrophoresis kit suitable for any vertically oriented PAGE technique. This comprehensive and portable laboratory set-up provides the complete advantages of safety, cost-efficiency, space management, and utility to the researchers for high-throughput research.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic led to an abrupt suspension of face-to-face teaching activities in higher education institutions across the globe. The instructors and faculty at most institutions have had to adapt, invent, and implement adjustments quickly to adopt an online learning environment. This has been an extraordinarily challenging time for both students and instructors, particularly as many were not aware of the affordances and weaknesses of the online learning environment before it was uptaken. Particularly for chemistry and related disciplines, this change in delivery mode is even more disruptive in courses that have laboratory components due to loss of access to laboratories. As a teaching community, it was our responsibility to respond quickly and effectively to students' learning needs during this unprecedented global crisis. In our course, we provided succinct pre-recorded lecture-videos by topic rather than live-streaming of lectures. The recordings were made available to students a minimum of 24 h before the scheduled lecture time. Students were then provided opportunities to attend live tutorial sessions (held on Zoom and live Q&A feature on Piazza) if they had any questions that they wanted to ask the lecturer directly. We believe that the asynchronous sessions were more equitable than synchronous ones. This meant that students with difficult and challenging home/learning environments (i.e., disruptions at home, work/family schedules, poor internet, limited access to devices, etc.) were minimally disadvantaged. The approach worked well in general for teaching chemistry to pharmacy students and we believe that it can be adopted for other subjects.

AB Providing students with training in advanced laboratory skills is an essential part of scientific education. At the same time, engaging students in research is becoming equally important. Classroom-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have emerged to fill this need, and can take many forms. In this article we describe reengineering an advanced organic synthesis laboratory at a primarily undergraduate institution into a CURE. This objective of this CURE is to provide small molecules relevant to an ongoing research program at a research-intensive institution. This new model cross trains students and provides a new structure for a CURE that could be adapted to other partnerships and institutions.

AB Protein engineering represents a modern approach to generate novel proteins for the different fields of biotechnology. Here, we report about an 8-day laboratory activity in which students generate enzyme variants to degrade the herbicide glyphosate. The students conduct a true research experiment in an important field (bioremediation by novel, engineered enzymes) and are introduced to widely used techniques in molecular biology and protein biochemistry laboratories. Based on a docking analysis of glycine (the original substrate) and of glyphosate into the active site of glycine oxidase, residues putatively involved in substrate selectivity are identified that will become the target of site-saturation mutagenesis. Each group of students focuses on the library generated at one position and selects the most active variant based on colorimetric screening. Following protein overexpression in Escherichia coli, the selected glycine oxidase variants are purified and their kinetic properties on glycine and glyphosate assessed. The best variant identified by the whole class is then used for detecting the herbicide in water. With the help of the professor, students can improve technical skills, ability to evaluate results, team work activity, and critical thinking.

AB Laboratory exercises focused on protein quantification are frequently conducted in traditional undergraduate biochemistry laboratory curriculum. The laboratory course described here is designed to provide students with experience in measurement of protein content in milk powder by moving reaction boundary titration (MRBT), a new rapid technique for total protein content determination in milk. In addition, this approach is weakly influenced by nonprotein nitrogen reagents such as melamine and urea. The course was done as three weekly laboratory exercises. First, students established a standard curve for milk protein concentration by MRBT method. Then, students investigated the influence of nonprotein nitrogen reagents on MRBT method. Finally, students made a comparison among three different protein quantification methods (MRBT, Biuret, and Kjeldahl method). From the experiments, students grasped the concept and advantages of MRBT and deepened the understanding of protein quantification. This course offer students the opportunity to be exposed to an advanced technique, which may have practical significance to their future study and work in the life science field.

AB Protein structure-function is a key concept in biochemistry. We used the perspective of domain-specific problem-solving to investigate students' solutions to a well-defined protein structure-function problem. We conducted think-aloud interviews with 13 undergraduate students and performed qualitative content analysis to examine the differences in the domain-general and domain-specific knowledge among correct and incorrect solutions. Our work revealed that students used domain-general and domain-specific knowledge in their problem solving. We also identified difficulties for students with the amino acid backbone, amino acid categorization, and causal mechanisms of noncovalent interactions. Using the identified difficulties, we make recommendations for the design of instructional materials targeted to improve protein structure-function problem solving in the biochemistry classroom.

AB Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the basis for many techniques used in biomedical research. Due to its wide use in molecular sensing, FRET is commonly introduced in many biology, chemistry, and physics courses. While FRET is of great importance in the biophysical sciences, the complexity and difficulty of constructing FRET experiments has resulted in limited usage in undergraduate laboratory settings. Here, we present a practical undergraduate laboratory experiment for teaching FRET using a diverse set of green-emitting fluorescent proteins (FPs) as donors for a cross-linked Yukon orange FP. This laboratory experiment enables students to make the connection of basic lab procedures to real world applications and can be applied to molecular biology, biochemistry, physical chemistry, and biophysical laboratory courses. Published 2018. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA., 46(5):516-522, 2018.

AB Debate and role play for learning critical thinking and communication skills are being increasingly used in various undergraduate medical schools worldwide. We aim to compare students' views about effectiveness of two teaching strategies; debate and role play to exercise critical thinking and communication skills during problem-based learning (PBL). This is a comparative, cross-sectional, and questionnaire-based study. Our subjects were second year undergraduate female medical students enrolled in Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), College of Medicine from September 2014-2016, divided into 10 small PBL groups (10-13 students/group/year). Students rated role play and debate as equally effective in improving communication skills. Debate was rated superior to role play in opening new avenues of thinking (p-value is 0.01), whereas in integration of knowledge of basic medical sciences with clinical skills and reflection of real life experience students rated role play being superior to debate (p-value 0.01 and 0.00, respectively). Both role play and debate are well accepted by the students in PBL curriculum as an effective teaching methodology. Both are perceived equally good in improving students' communication skills. Few aspects of critical thinking are improved more by role plays compared to debate and vice versa. (c) 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46:336-342, 2018.

AB Medical laboratory technology major was set up to meet rapid development of science and medical research technology in 2013. Students majoring in medical laboratory had learnt a lot of techniques distributed among different specialized courses. But, they did not understand why they had to learn these techniques and how they were applied in a real-world research setting. In a one-month innovation experimental practice described herein, students had learnt to induce, purify and identify an unknown glycoprotein from whole cell lysate using conA-based affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. Unlike in a traditional cookbook-style experiment, students chose a research subject on their own and did experiment using their selected variables. Over the one-month laboratory periods, students used sterile technique to cultivate cells, induced glycoprotein expression using LPS and IFN-, purified glycoprotein from cell lysate using agarose-conA beads, identified a glycoprotein via mass spectrometry, and confirmed the result using western blotting. At end of the practice, students were asked to evaluate their experiences via an anonymous survey. All students declared that this experimental practice was interesting and meaningful to them. The process of completing the project was to apply the learnt techniques to real-world biochemistry research, so they became aware of the importance and significance of techniques.

AB The appreciation and understanding of gas generation through processes is vital in biochemical education. In this work, an augmented reality tool is reported to depict the redox reaction between hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite solutions, two ubiquitous oxidizing agents, to create oxygen, a combustible gas. As it operates out of smartphones or tablets, students are able to conduct the exercise collaboratively, respond in a manner similar to an actual physical experiment, and able to depict the oxygen volume changes in relation to the volume of hydrogen peroxide of different concentrations used. The tool offers to help students acquire bench skills by limiting handing risks and to mitigate possible student anxiety on handling chemical materials and implements in the laboratory. The feedback received from Year 11 and 12 high school student participants in an outreach exercise indicate the overall effectiveness of this tool.

AB The central dogma has served as a foundational model for information flow, exchange, and storage in the biological sciences for several decades. Despite its continued importance, however, recent research suggests that novices in the domain possess several misconceptions regarding the aforementioned processes, including those pertaining specifically to the formation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts. In the present study, we sought to expand upon these observations through exploration of the influence of orientation cues on students' aptitude at synthesizing mRNAs from provided deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template strands. Data indicated that participants (n=45) were proficient at solving tasks of this nature when the DNA template strand and the mRNA molecule were represented in an antiparallel orientation. In contrast, participants' performance decreased significantly on items in which the mRNA was depicted in a parallel orientation relative to the DNA template strand. Furthermore, participants' Grade Point Average, self-reported confidence in understanding the transcriptional process, and spatial ability were found to mediate their performance on the mRNA synthesis tasks. Collectively, these data reaffirm the need for future research and pedagogical interventions designed to enhance students' comprehension of the central dogma in a manner that makes transparent its relevance to realworld scientific phenomena.

AB The Krebs Cycle is a highly taught biochemical pathway that is traditionally difficult to learn. Twenty-seven undergraduate students were randomized to a rote memorization arm or to a mnemonic arm. They were given a pre-test, then shown a lecture corresponding to their assigned method, and then given an immediate Week 0 post-test and a Week 4 post-test. Groups scored comparably low on the pre-test (p=0.7113). Students in the mnemonic arm performed better on the Week 0 post-test than those using rote (p=0.0055). By Week 4, there was evidence of knowledge decay, with both arms' having comparably low scores (mnemonic vs. rote, p=0.3739). The mnemonic assists in rapid acquisition of knowledge but probably has to be reviewed iteratively over time to demonstrate its full potential over rote memorization. A limited number of students from only one school was used. (C) 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 44: 224-229, 2016.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide an opportunity for students to engage in experiments with outcomes that are unknown to both the instructor and students. These experiences allow students and instructors to collaboratively bridge the research laboratory and classroom, and provide research experiences for a large number of students relative to traditional individual mentored research. Here, we describe a molecular biology CURE investigating the impact of clinically relevant mutations found in the bromodomain of the p300 transcriptional regulator on acetylated histone interaction. In the CURE, students identified missense mutations in the p300 bromodomain using the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database and hypothesized the effects of the mutation on the acetyl-binding function of the domain. They cloned and purified the mutated bromodomain and performed peptide pulldown assays to define its potential to bind to acetylated histones. Upon completion of the course, students showed increased confidence performing molecular techniques and reported positively on doing a research project in class. In addition, results generated in the classroom were further validated in the research laboratory setting thereby providing a new model for faculty to engage in both course-based and individual undergraduate research experiences.

AB The laboratory protocol presented here takes about 3 hours to perform and investigates protein and lipid interactions. Students first purify His(6)-tagged human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with Ni-NTA affinity resin in a simple batch protocol and prepare multilamellar vesicles (MLV) from pre-dried phospholipid films. When apoA-I is added to the MLV, much smaller protein/lipid nanodisc complexes are formed in some instances. Nanodisc formation can be monitored by a decrease in light-scattering intensity at 340 nm using a simple spectrophotometer. Students will observe nanodisc formation with MLV formed from the anionic phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol, which pack poorly into lipid bilayers, but not with MLV formed from the zwitterionic phospholipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, which form stable bilayers. This laboratory exercise is accompanied by questions and exercises that enable students a deeper of the dimensions of apoA-I and nanodiscs as well as the biological relevance of nanodisc formation in the process of reverse cholesterol transport.

AB The main purpose of this study was to present a simplified view of model metabolic cycles. Although the models have been elaborated with the Mathematica Program, and using a system of differential equations, the main conclusions were presented in a rather intuitive way, easily understandable by students of general courses of Biochemistry, and without any need of mathematical support. A change in any kinetic constant (Km or Vmax) of only one enzyme affected the metabolic profile of all the substrates of the cycle. In addition, it is shown how an increase in the Km or a decrease in the Vmax values of any particular enzyme promoted an increase of its substrate; the contrary occurred decreasing the Km or increasing the Vmax values.

AB The General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry Knowledge Assessment (GOB-CKA) is a multiple-choice instrument designed to assess students' understanding of the chemistry topics deemed important to clinical nursing practice. This manuscript describes the development process of the individual items along with a psychometric evaluation of the final version of the items and instrument. In developing items for the GOB-CKA, essential topics were identified through a series of expert interviews (with practicing nurses, nurse educators, and GOB chemistry instructors) and confirmed through a national survey. Individual items were tested in qualitative studies with students from the target population for clarity and wording. Data from pilot and beta studies were used to evaluate each item and narrow the total item count to 45. A psychometric analysis performed on data from the 45-item final version was used to provide evidence of validity and reliability. The final version of the instrument has a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.76. Feedback from an expert panel provided evidence of face and content validity. Convergent validity was estimated by comparing the results from the GOB-CKA with the General-Organic-Biochemistry Exam (Form 2007) of the American Chemical Society. Instructors who wish to use the GOB-CKA for teaching and research may contact the corresponding author for a copy of the instrument.

AB To help faculty prepare and revise courses in all the disciplines represented in the MCAT2015, the American Association of Medical Colleges, through its MedEdPORTAL's iCollaborative, has established the Pre-health Collection, a repository of reviewed web resources that are openly and freely available to faculty, and indirectly through them to students. The Pre-health Collection initiative makes use of the Internet to centralize teaching resources and to help faculty at institutions with fewer available resources to incorporate high quality teaching material specifically reviewed to assist students in obtaining the required pre-health competencies. As biochemistry competencies are increasingly represented in the new exam, it is important to grow the number of quality teaching resources for biochemistry within the portal and to develop a community of users and contributors. A description of the Pre-Health Collection and mechanisms for contributions are presented. (c) 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 41(2):76-78, 2013

AB In proteomics, complex mixtures of proteins are separated (usually by chromatography or electrophoresis) and identified by mass spectrometry. We have created 2DE Tandem MS, a computer program designed for use in the biochemistry, proteomics, or bioinformatics classroom. It contains two simulations-2D electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry. The two simulations are integrated together and are designed to teach the concept of proteome analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. 2DE-Tandem MS can be used as a freestanding simulation, or in conjunction with a wet lab, to introduce proteomics in the undergraduate classroom. 2DE Tandem MS is a free program available on Sourceforge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbf/. It was developed using Java Swing and functions in Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux, ensuring that every student sees a consistent and informative graphical user interface no matter the computer platform they choose. Java must be installed on the host computer to run 2DE Tandem MS. Example classroom exercises are provided in the Supporting Information.

ID COGNITIVE CONFLICT
AB Students often have an oversimplified view of biological facts, which may hinder subsequent understanding when conceptual complexity gives rise to cognitive conflicts. To avoid this situation here, we present a PBL approach for the analysis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which integrates a variety of topics in cell biology, genetics, and molecular biology, and it is used to illustrate the inherent complexities in some classical biological concepts. Students of two different courses analyze phenotypic, cellular, and molecular characteristics of EDS. Effect of mutations on collagen synthesis on collagen genes' expression and regulation or on connective tissues is reviewed and discussed. Information retrieval is used to develop students' skills in web-based molecular biology tools. Student interest and motivation is increased with the development of diagnostic protocols for a tissue biopsy and for an EDS causing mutation. Expected learning outcomes after completion of the project are also presented.

AB An undergraduate biochemistry laboratory experiment has been developed using biolayer interferometry (BLI), an optical biosensing technique similar to surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in which students obtain and analyze kinetic data for a protein-protein interaction. Optical biosensing is a technique of choice to determine kinetic and affinity constants for biomolecular interactions. Measurements can be made in real-time without labels, making biosensing particularly appropriate for the teaching laboratory. In the described exercise, students investigate the kinetics of Protein A-human Immunoglobin G binding under conditions that mimic simple 1: 1 binding. Students prepare appropriate serial dilutions of IgG and set up a microplate for the experiment by aliquotting biotinylated Protein A, buffer, and IgG solutions. A commercial BLI sensor, the ForteBio Octet QK, is used to measure binding. While data are collected students prepare a spreadsheet with which they will simulate the data to determine k(on), k(off), and K-D. Raw data from the sensor are then exported to the spreadsheets for analysis. Optimized experiment timing, regeneration methods and other parameters are described to increase throughput and reduce cost. The experiment is readily adaptable to other biosensing platforms such as SPR instruments.

AB An Adobe (R) animation is presented for use in undergraduate Biochemistry courses, illustrating the mechanism of Na(+) and K(+) translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis by the (Na, K)-ATPase, a P(2c)-type ATPase, or ATP-powered ion pump that actively translocates cations across plasma membranes. The enzyme is also known as an E(1)/E(2)-ATPase as it undergoes conformational changes between the E(1) and E(2) forms during the pumping cycle, altering the affinity and accessibility of the transmembrane ion-binding sites. The animation is based on Horisberger's scheme that incorporates the most recent significant findings to have improved our understanding of the (Na, K)-ATPase structure function relationship. The movements of the various domains within the (Na, K)-ATPase alpha-subunit illustrate the conformational changes that occur during Na(+) and K(+) translocation across the membrane and emphasize involvement of the actuator, nucleotide, and phosphorylation domains, that is, the "core engine" of the pump, with respect to ATP binding, cation transport, and ADP and P(i) release.

AB An explosion of data available in the life sciences has shifted the discipline toward genomics and quantitative data science research. Institutions of higher learning have been addressing this shift by modifying undergraduate curriculums resulting in an increasing number of bioinformatics courses and research opportunities for undergraduates. The goal of this study was to explore how a newly designed introductory bioinformatics seminar could leverage the combination of in-class instruction and independent research to build the practical skill sets of undergraduate students beginning their careers in the life sciences. Participants were surveyed to assess learning perceptions toward the dual curriculum. Most students had a neutral or positive interest in these topics before the seminar and reported increased interest after the seminar. Students had increases in confidence level in their bioinformatic proficiency and understanding of ethical principles for data/genomic science. By combining undergraduate research with directed bioinformatics skills, classroom seminars facilitated a connection between student's life sciences knowledge and emerging research tools in computational biology.

AB Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) facilitate competency-based assessments. India is on the verge of implementing competency-based training for postgraduate programs. MD degree in Biochemistry is a unique program available exclusively in India. Postgraduate programs in most specialties have started working toward EPA-based curriculum, in both India and other countries. However, EPAs for MD Biochemistry course are yet to be defined. This study aims to identify EPAs for postgraduate training program in Biochemistry. Identification and attaining consensus on the list of EPAs for MD Biochemistry curriculum was done by modified Delphi method. The study was conducted in three rounds. In round 1, tasks expected from an MD Biochemistry graduate were identified by working group followed by expert panel validation. The tasks were organized and reframed to EPAs. Two rounds of online survey were conducted to achieve a consensus on the list of EPAs. Consensus measure was calculated. A cut-off value of 80% and above was considered to reflect good consensus. The working group identified 59 tasks. This was validated by 10 experts based on which, 53 items were retained. These tasks were reframed into 27 EPAs. In round 2, 11 EPAs achieved good consensus. Among the remaining EPAs, 13 achieved consensus of 60%-80% and were selected for round 3. Five EPAs achieved good consensus in this round. A total of 16 EPAs were identified for MD Biochemistry curriculum. This study provides a frame of reference for experts to develop an EPA-based curriculum in the future.

AB Laboratory courses should cultivate enthusiasm for research and an appreciation for real-world scientific challenges to retain undergraduate students and encourage them to pursue STEM-related careers. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) have emerged as an inclusive pedagogical model that facilitates laboratory skill development, while also improving self-efficacy and critical thinking skills. Herein, an innovative research-inspired Ames test for mutagenicity project is described. Students choose their own project theme and investigate substances using both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium to evaluate the potential for frameshift mutations and base-pair substitutions, respectively. An appropriate test concentration of each substance is first determined via a cytotoxicity assay, providing an additional learning opportunity. Students also study the mutagenicity of test substance metabolites using commercially available rat liver extracts to simulate metabolism. Overall, these experiences provide a comprehensive research project with high relevancy to human health and real-world importance. This laboratory module was assessed using CURE pre- and post-course surveys to evaluate learning gains and benefits. Assessment data illustrated that students appreciated the discovery aspect of the research project and gained skills related to reading scientific literature and effective poster presentations. Student-reported benefits of research project participation included learning new laboratory techniques, enhanced scientific writing skills, an increased tolerance for and understanding of common research challenges, and the confidence to tackle more complex research endeavors. Narrative feedback from students was very positive, with project highlights being the opportunity to select their own test substances and create new knowledge, as well as the analysis of results.

AB The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic results in the turning from offline teaching to online teaching. Students enjoy short videos and like barrage during the pandemic. We found that the introduction of barrage into online teaching is of great help to improve the students' attention and enthusiasm. In order to verify the correctness of this conjecture, we launched a questionnaire survey. According to the preliminary conclusions, we found that student's think that such adaption is not only interesting, but also can promote the interaction, and therefore improve the learning effect. It should conform to the trend of teaching development in the new era.

ID PERFORMANCE; IMPACT
AB An optional electronic resource (e-resource) that requiring subscription was offered to 2nd year students studying university cell biology. An online survey attitudes identified cost, the relative (lack) ease of use, and a "general preference", as primary reasons for not utilizing the e-resource. The ability to access graphics, videos, and animations, as well as practice questions, was all seen as positive features. Of the 44 e-resource students, a performance increase of 10% (73%, and 63%, p-value = 0.004) was seen compared to those that did not (90). Within the e-resource cohort, academic performance in the previous year, when other online resources were not optional, less of a differentiation was apparent, suggesting difference were not attributable to individual academic aptitudes. Overall, an increase in academic performance was seen in students that used the optional e-resource. These findings will be presented to assist new students in deciding how to approach their learning in cell biology.

AB With the growing importance of the field of RNA biology, undergraduates need to perform RNA-related research. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has become an important method in RNA biology. The principles of SELEX were applied to a semester-long course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in which two rounds of in vivo functional selection of regions of a viral RNA were performed. As the labwork had an unknown outcome, students indicated that they were excited by the work and became invested in the experience. By completing two rounds of SELEX, the students repeated molecular methods (e.g., RNA extraction, RT-PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA purification, cloning, and sequence analysis) and reported that repetition reinforced their learning and helped them build confidence in their lab abilities. Students also appreciated that they did not learn a "technique-per-week" without context, but rather they understood why certain methods were used for certain molecular tasks. Results from a 19-question multiple-choice assessment indicated increased comprehension of theory underlying methods performed. Details regarding experimental methods and timeline, and assessment and attitudinal results from three student cohorts, are described herein.

AB We are living in the Big Data era, and yet we may have serious troubles when dealing with a handful of kinetic data if we are not properly instructed. The aim of this paper, related to enzyme kinetics, is to illustrate how to determine the K-m and V-max of a michaelian enzyme avoiding the pitfalls in which we often fall. To this end, we will resort to kinetic data obtained by second-year Biochemistry students during a laboratory experiment using beta-galactosidase as an enzyme model, assayed at different concentrations of its substrate. When these data were analyzed using conventional linear regression of double-reciprocal plots, the range of K-m and V-max values obtained by different students varied widely. Even worse, some students obtained negative values for the kinetic parameters. Although such a scenario could make us think of a wide inter-student variability regarding their skills to obtain reliable data, the reality was quite different: when properly analyzed (accounting for error propagation) the data obtained by all the students were good enough to allow a correct estimation of the K-m (2.8 +/- 0.3 mM) and V-max (179 +/- 27 mM/min) with a reduced intergroup standard deviation. A student-accessible discussion of the importance of weighted linear regression in biochemical sciences is provided.

ID JOURNAL CLUB
AB At our small liberal arts college, we require undergraduates majoring in Biology and Biomedical Sciences to take a seminar in the spring of their senior year. Each year, the seminar focuses on a different topic in molecular biology and/or biochemistry. The course operates as a "journal club"-every week, a student presents a peer-reviewed research article, and the instructor moderates a discussion. When the transition to remote learning occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the seminar meetings were moved online to a Zoom-based platform, and the course topic was changed to focus on emerging research regarding the novel coronavirus. The continuation of the Biology senior seminar in a remote context was straightforward, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus furnished a rich theme for exploration of diverse topics in molecular biology and genetics.

AB Mitochondrial beta-oxidation is one of the most common modes of fatty acids' oxidation in most organisms, particularly mammals. Biochemistry undergraduate curriculum often contains the description of the process, with emphasis on ATP calculations for various types of fatty acids. During our decade long teaching experience in biochemistry, we observed the difficulty faced by students in calculating energetics of several fatty acids beyond palmitic acid. We developed a canonical formula by mathematical transformations and logical derivation to aid the calculation in a much simpler manner to ease both teaching and learning experience. ATP yield of even-numbered fatty acids may be calculated using a formula [(7C - 6 - 1.5 D) - 2(D-2)], andadenosine triphosphate (ATP) yield for odd-numbered fatty acids can be calculated using [(7C - 19 - 1.5 D) - 2(D-2)], where C is the number of carbon atoms in fatty acids, D is the number of double bonds. The unbold part of the formulae is limited to polyunsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, we integrated these formulae into an HTML based web-interface for handily calculations, which is likely to augment fatty acids oxidation learning-teaching processes easier. This tool has been recently tested in our classroom programs on biochemistry and received an excellent feedback from the learners. Also, the mathematical formula is ready for being incorporated into standard biochemistry textbooks. The webtool as an opensource biochemical calculator can be effectively used in classrooms by both instructors and students while solving comprehension based questions on lipid metabolism.

AB The interdisciplinary subject of agricultural biochemistry can provide an abundance of didactic opportunities for educators teaching biochemistry and molecular biology in secondary-level science courses. This is especially true in present times when virtual-learning strategies supersede in-person instruction and contemporary approaches are needed to engage students with relevant applications of science. In this communication, we discuss how pairing daily lessons in agricultural biochemistry with periodic e-notebook usage further refines this strategy by promoting content-retrieval and providing educators with formative feedback on student progress in a simple and inexpensive manner.

AB Anticipated learning outcomes (LOs) were defined and used for the backward design of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). These LOs reflect the inquiry-based nature of CUREs and capture key knowledge and skills inherent to scientific practice and essential in research. The LOs were used to plan a formative and summative assessment strategy to support and evaluate student achievement. A research question was identified that aligned with the learning goals of the course, provided an opportunity for discovery and iteration, and introduced a variety of molecular, cellular, and biochemical techniques. The course is offered to students in the final year of their degree and delivered over a 12-week period with two 3-hr labs each week. These LOs, and the rigorous assessment strategy used to support them, could be adapted to different projects. Likewise, the laboratory exercises are presented as a series of modules highlighting opportunities for adaptation to a variety of schedules.

AB A vibrant and sustainable research environment is essential to establish a thriving PhD program. Organization for PhD Education in Health Sciences in European System, a European platform to promote best practices in PhD education in health sciences, published a guideline entitled "Best Practices for PhD Training." The guideline includes comprehensive recommendations and suggestions on different components of the PhD program, of which supervision is an essential one. A working supervisor-student relationship based on mutual respect, responsibility, and participation is essential for the success of a PhD thesis. Supervisors should be active researchers and receive training to develop their supervising skills. They serve as role models in academic life, both scientifically and ethically. The appointment of a co-supervisor, besides the principal one, is strongly encouraged not only to increase the efficiency in monitoring the student progression but also to defuse interpersonal conflicts. Institutional regulations should include the duties and responsibilities of the supervisor. A contract prepared by the institution and signed by the supervisor and the student could help specify the task and may serve as a starting point. In case of a conflict, grievance mechanisms also need to be clear and explicit. Supervisors ought to assist the career development of the students and guide them to become independent researchers. Unfortunately, different surveys showed that there is widespread discontent among the students about their supervisors. Performance pressure on both students and supervisors create enormous tension. Students feel stressed about their career prospects. Institutional policies should consider these stress points to enhance the wellbeing of students as well as the faculty.

AB Easy and visually appealing demonstrations are precious tools for introducing students to the study of enzymes. However, they most often involve purified enzymes and dedicated techniques. Here, we propose a set of demonstrations, which require only fresh horseradish root and consumer chemicals, to help support biochemistry and enzymology courses from high school to the undergraduate level. Horseradish root is a naturally rich source of horseradish peroxidase, an enzyme with many relevant practical applications. Slices of horseradish root are used to demonstrate the characteristic reaction of horseradish peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide, the selective inhibition of this enzyme by dilute hydrochloric acid, its chromogenic reaction with N,N '-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and its ability to trigger the chemiluminescent reaction of luminol.

AB Laboratory exercises for undergraduate biochemistry students are described in which changes in sugar content during fermentation of the trendy beverage kombucha are analyzed by three methods: thin layer chromatography, a 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay, and a standard commercial blood glucose meter. Each of the three analyses can be completed in a typical laboratory session lasting two to three hours. The exercises are designed to reinforce concepts typically covered in an undergraduate biochemistry course as well as to teach a variety of laboratory techniques. The exercises have been used with positive results in an upper level biochemistry laboratory course for junior/senior students majoring in chemistry or biology.

   inconsistence in symbols
AB A number of terms have been defined and inconsistently used across various texts in enzymology which may attract the attention of undergraduate students and instructors. At some places, inconsistent use results in confusions as well as leads to the misuse of these terms. Although it is difficult to resolve such inconsistencies, attempts have constantly been made by international regulatory forums such as International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) and other similar organizations to abolish the inconsistencies. This article highlights some of the most commonly occurring confusing and inconsistent terms in enzymology. We have gathered shreds of evidences and provide here possible suggestions and caution for readers and instructors, so that mistakes can be minimized and possible guidelines can be prepared for their usage. A few inconsistencies observed and discussed here include different notations of activation energy, differences in terms uncompetitive and noncompetitive in enzyme inhibition, classification of cofactors and definitions of their sub-types, and confusing usage of the enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant. Besides this, we have also highlighted the inconsistencies in the enzyme nomenclature. (c) 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(2): 140-144, 2019.

DE New teaching method; engagement; rapid formative assessment; feedback;

ID STUDENT; BIOCHEMISTRY
AB In Australian Universities, based on a study from 1992 to 2014, the Feedback item has been consistently poorly rated by students. In addition, Biochemistry is a complex STEM subject which many students find difficult and was considered the hardest subject according to a recent study by Antigua medical school in the United States. In this work, a new and interactive teaching method, FastFeedback Questions (FFQs), has been devised. FFQs are a rapid formative feedback method that involves embedding carefully crafted focus questions alongside PowerPoint slides (outside the slide field). The PPT is then projected as usual, but not in slide show mode, so the areas outside the main slide window are visible to the students. Prior to the lecture students receive a version without the answers. During the face-to-face lecture, the lecturer goes through the answers in an interactive way by requesting that students answer the FFQs, which can be verified immediately from the PPT slide. The focus questions not only increase students' understanding of the slides, they also model good answers. FFQs were delivered to the students of third year clinical biochemistry at Curtin University. Number of students in this study, n=311. The final exam marks support the use of FFQs as there is an overall improvement of the student average grade by approximate to 10% from approximate to 63% in 2010-2014 (no FFQs) to approximate to 72.6% in 2015-2017 (FFQs). FFQs have also gained the accolade of the students as their feedback was on average approximate to 97% compared to approximate to 80.5% for the Faculty and University.

AB An inexpensive enzyme kinetics laboratory exercise for undergraduate biochemistry students is described utilizing tyrosinase from white button mushrooms. The exercise can be completed in one or two three-hour lab sessions. The optimal amounts of enzyme, substrate (catechol), and inhibitor (kojic acid) are first determined, and then kinetic data is collected in the absence and presence of the inhibitor. A Microsoft Excel template is used to plot the data and to fit the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data to determine the kinetic parameters V-max and K-m. The exercise is designed to clarify and reinforce concepts covered in an accompanying biochemistry lecture course. It has been used with positive results in an upper-level biochemistry laboratory course for junior/senior students majoring in chemistry or biology.

ID VISUAL LITERACY; STUDENTS
AB A thorough understanding of the molecular biosciences requires the ability to visualize and manipulate molecules in order to interpret results or to generate hypotheses. While many instructors in biochemistry and molecular biology use visual representations, few indicate that they explicitly teach visual literacy. One reason is the need for a list of core content and competencies to guide a more deliberate instruction in visual literacy. We offer here the second stage in the development of one such resource for biomolecular three-dimensional visual literacy. We present this work with the goal of building a community for online resource development and use. In the first stage, overarching themes were identified and submitted to the biosciences community for comment: atomic geometry; alternate renderings; construction/annotation; het group recognition; molecular dynamics; molecular interactions; monomer recognition; symmetry/asymmetry recognition; structure-function relationships; structural model skepticism; and topology and connectivity. Herein, the overarching themes have been expanded to include a 12th theme (macromolecular assemblies), 27 learning goals, and more than 200 corresponding objectives, many of which cut across multiple overarching themes. The learning goals and objectives offered here provide educators with a framework on which to map the use of molecular visualization in their classrooms. In addition, the framework may also be used by biochemistry and molecular biology educators to identify gaps in coverage and drive the creation of new activities to improve visual literacy. This work represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, to catalog a comprehensive list of explicit learning goals and objectives in visual literacy.

AB Viewing and manipulating three-dimensional (3D) structures in molecular graphics software are essential tasks for researchers and students to understand the functions of molecules. Currently, the way to manipulate a 3D molecular object is mainly based on mouse-and-keyboard control that is usually difficult and tedious to learn. While gesture-based and touch-based interactions are increasingly popular in interactive software systems, their suitability in handling molecular graphics has not yet been sufficiently explored. Here, we designed the gesture-based and touch-based interaction methods to manipulate virtual objects in PyMOL utilizing the motion and touch sensors in a mobile device. Three fundamental viewing controls-zooming, translation and rotation-and frequently used functions were implemented. Results from a pilot user study reveal that task performances on viewing controls using a mobile device are slightly reduced as compared to mouse-and-keyboard method. However, it is considered to be more suitable for oral presentations and equally suitable for education scenarios such as school classes.

AB Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is widely used in diagnosis and research to determine specific mRNA expressions in cells. As RT-qPCR applications increase, it's necessary to provide undergraduates hands-on experience of this modern technique. Here, we report a 3-week laboratory exercise using RT-qPCR to demonstrate the light-dependent expressions of AtRBCS1A and AtRBCS3B genes encoding two Arabidopsis thaliana small subunits of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). In the first week, students purified and quantified total RNA from leaves of A. thaliana pretreated in the dark for 96 hr and untreated controls. In the second week, RNA samples were separated by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and used for RT-qPCR. Students calculated expressions of the two genes in dark treated leaves as percentages of those of the controls by using the 2(T)(-C) method and the collected C(T)s. In the third week, class C(T)s, melting curves, students' calculations, and factors affecting the reliability of RT-qPCR results were summarized and discussed. Students' results show that (i) relatively pure and intact RNA samples are obtained; (ii) ACTIN2 is a better reference gene than the 18S rRNA; (iii) the dark treatment reduces both gene expressions to<1%; (iv) the reduction in the expression of AtRBCS3B is significantly more than that of the AtRBCS1A. Results from pre- and post-lab tests indicate that besides the theory, this exercise helps students learn the applications and associated techniques of RT-qPCR. Future modifications and new experiments that can be developed based on students' learning outcomes and assessment are also discussed.

AB Reports from employers of higher education graduates indicate the existence of a considerable gap between the skills required by employers and those possessed by recent graduates. As a first step toward closing this gap, this study aims to determine its origin. Interviews with nine research-active biochemistry professionals were used to identify the most important skills for biochemistry students to succeed in research positions postgraduation. The results of these interviews were used to develop a survey, which was then administered to a larger group of biochemistry faculty and industry professionals. The output of the survey was a list of 52 skills valued by biochemistry professionals and rated by perceived importance. Importantly, the survey results also afford a comparative look at the prioritization of skills by two key populations: the academic hiring them. While there are many areas of agreement between these two populations, the survey also reveals areas were priorities diverge. The discrepancies found here suggest that the skills gap manifest at the point of employment may stem directly from differences in prioritization between the academic and industrial environments. This article aims to provide insight into the needs and requirements of the modern biochemical research environment, and invites debate concerning the preparation students receive in academia. Moreover, the results presented herein point to a need for further exploration of the possible misalignment of these two critical environments for young scientists.

AB To lead positive change in the teaching practice of teams that service large numbers of diverse students from multiple degree programs provides many challenges. The primary aim of this study was to provide a clear framework on which to plan the process of change that can be utilized by academic departments sector wide. Barriers to change were reduced by adapting and utilizing Kotter's principals of change specifically by creating a sense of urgency and defining a clear goal designed to address the problem. Changing attitudes involved training staff in new teaching and learning approaches and strategies, and creating a collaborative, supportive team-based teaching environment within which the planned changes could be implemented and evaluated. As a result senior academics are now directly involved in delivering sections of the face-to-face teaching in the new environment. Through promoting positive change we enabled deeper student engagement with the theoretical concepts delivered in lectures as evidenced by favorable student evaluations, feedback, and improved final exam results. A collaborative team-based approach that recognizes the importance of distributed leadership combined with a clearly articulated change management process were central to enabling academics to design, try, and evaluate the new teaching and learning practices. Our study demonstrates that a concerted focus on change management enabled teaching team members to adopt a major shift in the teaching and learning approach that resulted in measurable improvements in student learning.

AB Gel filtration chromatography (GFC) separates molecules according to size and is one of the most widely used methods for protein purification. Here, red fluorescent protein (RFP), green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), and/or their fusion proteins were prokaryotically expressed, purified, and used in a laboratory exercise to intuitively demonstrate GFC. Different bands, corresponding to RFP, RFP-CFP (RC), YFP-RFP-YFP (YRY), and pyruvate kinase II-GFP (PKG) were well separated on a Superdex 200 column from a 0.5-mL sample. Increasing the sample volume and changing the chromatographic resin to Sephadex G-100 resulted in lower resolution separation. Students enjoyed identifying combinations of colored proteins and found this exercise helpful for understanding the factors that affect GFC resolution.

ID GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN
AB This adaptable graduate laboratory course on protein purification offers students the opportunity to explore a wide range of techniques while allowing the instructor the freedom to incorporate their own personal research interests. The course design involves two sequential purification schemes performed in a single semester. The first part comprises the expression and purification of a recombinant GFP-binding protein from E. coli. The student-purified GFP-binding protein is then used in the second part of the course to immunoprecipitate GFP-tagged proteins, and their potential interacting partners, from cell or tissue extracts. As an example, we describe the immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged proteins from Drosophila melanogaster larval extracts that are homologous to proteins implicated in human diseases, followed by western blotting to examine student experimental outcomes. However, the widespread availability of GFP-fusion proteins in diverse organisms enables researchers to tailor the second part of the course to their specific research programs while maintaining the flexibility to engage students in active learning. Student evaluations indicate a genuine excitement for research and in depth knowledge of both the techniques performed and the theory behind them.

AB Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are commonly used techniques associated with clinical and research applications within the immunology and medical fields. The use of these techniques is becoming increasingly valuable in many life science and engineering disciplines as well. Herein, we report the development and evaluation of a novel half-semester course that focused on introducing undergraduate and graduate students to advance conceptual and technical skills associated with flow cytometry and ELISA, with emphasis on applications, experimental design, and data analysis. This course was offered in the North Carolina State University Biotechnology Program over three semesters and consisted of weekly lectures and laboratories. Students performed and/or analyzed flow cytometry and ELISA in three separate laboratory exercises: (1) identification of transgenic zebrafish hematopoietic cells, (2) analysis of transfection efficiency, and (3) analysis of cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Student learning outcomes were achieved as demonstrated by multiple means of assessment, including three laboratory reports, a data analysis laboratory practicum, and a cumulative final exam. Further, anonymous student self-assessment revealed increased student confidence in the knowledge and skill sets defined in the learning outcomes.

AB The practice of using images in teaching is widespread, and in science education images are used so extensively that some have argued they are now the "main vehicle of communication'' C. Ferreira, A. Arroio Problems Educ. 21st Century 2009, 16, 48-53). Although this phenomenon is especially notable in the field of biochemistry, we know little about the role and importance of images in communicating concepts to students in the classroom. This study reports the development of a scale to assess students' attitude toward biochemical images, particularly their willingness and ability to use the images to support their learning. In addition, because it is argued that images are central in the communication of biochemical concepts, we investigated three "learner differences'' which might impact learning outcomes in this kind of classroom environment: attitude toward images, visual cognitive skills, and learning approach. Overall, the students reported a positive attitude toward the images, the majority agreeing that they liked images and considered them useful. However, the participants also reported that verbal explanations were more important than images in helping them to understand the concepts. In keeping with this we found that there was no relationship between learning outcomes and the students' self-reported attitude toward images or visual cognitive skills. In contrast, learning outcomes were significantly correlated with the students' self-reported approach to learning. These findings suggest that images are not necessarily the main vehicle of communication in a biochemistry classroom and that verbal explanations and encouragement of a deep learning approach are important considerations in improving our pedagogical approach.

AB Although doctoral mentors recognize the benefits of providing quality advisement and close guidance, those of sharing project management responsibilities with mentees are still not well recognized. We observed that mentees, who have the opportunity to co-manage projects, generate more written output. Here we examine the link between research productivity, doctoral mentoring practices (DMP), and doctoral research experiences (DRE) of mentees in programs in the non-West. Inspired by previous findings that early career productivity is a strong predictor of later productivity, we examine the research productivity of 210 molecular biology doctoral students in selected programs in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Using principal component (PC) analysis, we derive two sets of PCs: one set from 15 DMP and another set from 16 DRE items. We model research productivity using Poisson and negative-binomial regression models with these sets as predictors. Our findings suggest a need to re-think extant practices and to allocate resources toward professional career development in training future scientists. We contend that doctoral science training must not only be an occasion for future scientists to learn scientific and technical skills, but it must also be the opportunity to experience, to acquire, and to hone research management skills.

AB An undergraduate laboratory exercise is described to demonstrate the biochemical applications of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The 93 cysteine residue of hemoglobin is labeled by the covalent binding of 3-maleimido-proxyl (5-MSL) and 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxyl-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSL), respectively. The excess spin label is removed by gel-exclusion chromatography. Changes in the mobility of the reporter groups attached to the protein are monitored by EPR spectroscopy. While the spectral parameters of the rigidly attached 5-MSL provide information on the rotation of the whole spin labeled protein, MTSL bound by a more flexible linkage describes the local environment of the cysteine residue in the interior of the protein structure. Students can study the known crystal structure of hemoglobin in comparison to the results they obtain by analyzing the EPR spectra. Overall, the exercise introduces them to laboratory techniques such as protein labeling, gel filtration, EPR spectroscopy, as well as familiarizes them with the online Protein Data Bank as a research resource and PyMOL software as a structure visualization tool.

AB A study of modern genetics requires students to successfully unite the principles of Mendelian genetics with the functions of DNA. Traditional means of teaching genetics are often successful in teaching Mendelian and molecular ideas but not in allowing students to see how the two subjects relate. The laboratory module presented here attempts to present classical and molecular genetic concepts together as an inquiry-based exploration appropriate for high school or introductory undergraduate students. Using the non-essential APQ12 gene in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, students perform PCR, selective growth, and sporulation experiments to establish the ploidy and APQ12 zygosity of a series of unknown strains. Each experiment contributes data to characterize the unknown strains, but complete characterization is not possible without assimilating the data from all of the experiments. The module allows students to consider concepts normally introduced and emphasized in Mendelian genetics and explore them using molecular and experimental tools. Comparison of pre-module and post-module assessment surveys show an increase in student ability to link Mendelian concepts to experimental procedures relying on DNA analysis. The development of modules such as these provides students of all backgrounds with the tools to engage the complexities and issues that constitute modern principles of inheritance.

AB This open-ended practical series titled "Molecular Identification of Unknown Food Bacteria" which extended over a 6-week period was designed with the aims of giving students an opportunity to gain an understanding of naturally occurring food bacteria and skills in contemporary molecular methods using real food samples. The students first isolated two unknown bacterial strains from two food sources from which they extracted DNA and performed PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Gel electrophoresis was used to analyze both genomic DNA preparations and PCR products. Following purification of PCR products, DNA sequencing was carried out and sequence trace quality was analyzed. The students successfully identified the two unknown bacteria using the BLAST search engine and a wide variety of different organisms were found. Assessment of their understanding of the procedure and ability to explain their findings using supporting primary research literature was via an individually prepared written report. Feedback from students over 2 years (n = 52) in a questionnaire revealed that the practical series was an engaging learning experience and lead to perceived improvements in knowledge of molecular techniques and bioinformatics and also about commonly occurring bacteria in foods.

AB We describe a 10-week laboratory course of guided research experiments thematically linked by topic, which had an ultimate goal of strengthening the undergraduate research-teaching nexus. This undergraduate laboratory course is a direct extension of faculty research interests. From DNA isolation, characterization, and mutagenesis, to protein expression and structural analysis, the research protocols were adapted to suit the weekly 3-hour biochemistry course. The experiments described are flexible and hypothesis driven, allowing original research to be conducted. Students gain practice in some of the most common techniques used in biochemistry and molecular biology, including minipreps and DNA spectrophometric analysis, DNA restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR mutagenesis, DNA sequencing analyses, E. coli transformations, whole cell protein extractions, SDS-PAGE, immunoblots, molecular modeling, and bioinformatics. The studies that begun in the classroom were continued in the research laboratory by undergraduate students, and eventually, the results were published in peer reviewed research articles. This research-educational program effectively integrated basic research endeavors into the undergraduate curriculum. It proved to be synergistic by nature: research stimulated teaching and teaching supported research. In our experience, this is an effective mechanism to conduct productive research while satisfying teaching duties in undergraduate institutions, where scholarly research is expected but teaching is the primary mission.

TI Evaluating ChatGPT as a self-learning tool in medical biochemistry: A
   performance assessment in undergraduate medical university examination

AB The emergence of ChatGPT as one of the most advanced chatbots and its ability to generate diverse data has given room for numerous discussions worldwide regarding its utility, particularly in advancing medical education and research. This study seeks to assess the performance of ChatGPT in medical biochemistry to evaluate its potential as an effective self-learning tool for medical students. This evaluation was carried out using the university examination question papers of both parts 1 and 2 of medical biochemistry which comprised theory and multiple choice questions (MCQs) accounting for a total of 100 in each part. The questions were used to interact with ChatGPT, and three raters independently reviewed and scored the answers to prevent bias in scoring. We conducted the inter-item correlation matrix and the interclass correlation between raters 1, 2, and 3. For MCQs, symmetric measures in the form of kappa value (a measure of agreement) were performed between raters 1, 2, and 3. ChatGPT generated relevant and appropriate answers to all questions along with explanations for MCQs. ChatGPT has "passed" the medical biochemistry university examination with an average score of 117 out of 200 (58%) in both papers. In Paper 1, ChatGPT has secured 60 +/- 2.29 and 57 +/- 4.36 in Paper 2. The kappa value for all the cross-analysis of Rater 1, Rater 2, and Rater 3 scores in MCQ was 1.000. The evaluation of ChatGPT as a self-learning tool in medical biochemistry has yielded important insights. While it is encouraging that ChatGPT has demonstrated proficiency in this area, the overall score of 58% indicates that there is work to be done. To unlock its full potential as a self-learning tool, ChatGPT must focus on generating not only accurate but also comprehensive and contextually relevant content.

AB Microbiome study requires both molecular techniques and bioinformatics skills, which are challenging for biologists to participate in this growing field. To introduce microbiome concepts and skills to students, a 6-week wet-lab and bioinformatics course for undergraduates was implemented through the project-based learning (PBL) approach. In the saliva microbiome project, students collected their saliva samples, performed DNA extraction and PCR amplification, followed by metagenomic analysis to compare the diversity and abundances of microbes among samples. First, students are required to practice molecular techniques and bioinformatics analysis skills in a virtual simulation lab. To our knowledge, our study is the first one to incorporate a virtual lab into microbiome experience. Then, students applied their recently acquired skills to produce and analyze their own 16S amplicon sequencing data and reported their results via a scientific report. The student learning outcomes show that the Virtual lab can improve students' laboratory techniques and research capabilities. Moreover, a simple pipeline to analyze 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data is introduced in a step-by-step manner that helps students to develop analysis skills. This project can be modified as either a virtual course or a module within another course such as microbiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Our study provides evidence on the positive impact of virtual labs on learning outcomes in undergraduate science education.

AB Engagement in research as an undergraduate and the availability of mentorship from peers and professionals are effective strategies for improving retention of students in STEM fields. Undergraduates in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder enroll in one of two large introductory course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) as a requirement of the degree. However, more diverse efforts toward formally supporting students seeking to refine their career goals is needed. We designed a networking-based workshop series aimed at providing access to the current and former students who have been recently successful in achieving relevant educational and career goals. This 5-week series focused on (1) how to convert a resume to a curriculum vitae, (2) careers that are accessible with a bachelor's degree in the life sciences, (3) types of research opportunities as an undergraduate and as a post-graduate, (4) the application process and strategies for successful candidacy in medical school applications, and (5) PhD programs and approaches to producing a competitive application. The workshop connected 52 undergraduates with mentors; the majority of participants requested contact information for continued mentoring. Here, we describe the structure of this remote workshop series and highlight results that emphasized the need for such support that may extend beyond pandemic times.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the need to reliably detect the presence of viral genomes in human clinical samples. The most accurate viral tests involve the use of qPCR. Thus, it is important for students to understand the mechanism to detect viral genomes by qPCR including critical qPCR controls and how to properly interpret qPCR data. Herein, we describe a 2-week undergraduate laboratory to detect a viral genome in a human DNA sample. The strategy follows a SARS-CoV-2 qPCR test in numerous ways. Students are provided isolated DNA representing a mock human patient sample, and determine if a viral genome (bacteriophage lambda) is present using qPCR. A battery of control samples and patient pooling strategies are utilized. The laboratory exercise is successful based on high rates of student success in detecting viral genomes, pre-quiz and post-quiz assessments focusing on viral qPCR testing, and positive student comments.

AB We describe a first-semester, integrated, introductory biology and chemistry course for undergraduates at Wellesley College in Wellesley, MA, USA. Our vision was to create a supportive learning community in which students could comfortably make connections between scientific disciplines as they learned necessary content for subsequent courses, further developed problem solving, communication, and laboratory skills, and meaningfully connected with other students and with faculty during their first semester in college. Through highlighting five guiding principles that are central to the course, we describe the integrated course structure and content as well as our efforts to build community, provide support, and engage students in building skills crucial to scientists. We also highlight features of this course and institutional policies that facilitated its logistical and collaborative implementation that can be adapted to fit the needs, goals, and constraints of a diverse range of institutions. A companion article describes an assessment of our course in achieving academic and community building goals.

DE COVID-19; CUREs; face-to-face instruction; genetics; hybrid modality;
   online teaching; simulation labs; undergraduate
AB In the spring semester of 2020, colleges and universities adopted online teaching as the primary modality due to campus closure for social distancing. While lectures could be more readily converted to online classes, biology labs were challenging to handle since students could not physically conduct experiments in lab classrooms. In the present report, various online teaching materials, including educational and research videos, simulation labs, and real research data, were utilized to achieve the learning objectives of the originally in-person lab classes of an upper-level undergraduate genetics course. Furthermore, certain advantages of online teaching, such as detailed and high-quality annotation of lecture slides using the Apple Pencil and iPad, were observed. While online teaching has its unique strengths, it could not provide students with hands-on experience in performing real biology experiments to master technical skills; the latter are essential for students to develop a career in conducting research in an academic or industrial laboratory setting. Hence, a well-designed hybrid modality of using online teaching to complement conventional face-to-face instruction may allow for better teaching in undergraduate biology courses.

AB Teaching biochemistry well is not an easy job for teachers and so is learning biochemistry well for students. Just as many students often complain, they virtually always fail in either physiology or biochemistry. I have been teaching biochemistry at Nanjing University for over 25 years and am very successful in my biochemistry-teaching career. The way and style that I teach biochemistry is highly praised by both my students and my fellow teachers. As an instructor, the most important thing is, I think, you have to do your best to arouse or ignite students' interest in biochemistry learning. But how? In this article, I will introduce many first-hand practical tips on how to arouse the students 'interest in studying biochemistry from giving the first lecture to last lecture, from how to combine advanced teaching methods with traditional teaching methods to how to combine classic biochemistry with latest biochemical developments, from the main classroom teaching to organization of extracurricular activities as the second classroom, and so on. These tips are proven very useful and then can be followed by other professors who are teaching biochemistry. Hopefully, they can help many professors improve their skills for teaching biochemistry.

AB Biology and biochemistry students must learn to visualize and comprehend the complex three-dimensional (3D) structures of macromolecules such as proteins or DNA. However, most tools available for teaching biomolecular structures typically operate in two dimensions. Here, we present protocols and pedagogical approaches for using immersive augmented reality (AR) visors, specifically the Microsoft HoloLens, to reinforce learning with large scale 3D holographic structures. We developed a novel workflow to render vividly colored custom biomolecules in AR visors. In addition, we developed AR exercises to review concepts relevant to protein or DNA structure and then implemented the exercises in four different biology and biochemistry courses. Surveys showed that students reported greater interest in biomolecular structures after the exercise. We also highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of the software and hardware of this upcoming technology.

AB COVID-19 results in the suspension of life all over the world. Universities suspended their academic activities except for online courses for undergrad and grad students. However, PhD students in both biochemistry and molecular biology fields must hold their experiments at the laboratories. Even under these extreme circumstances, the academic journey of a master's or PhD student should not be stopped; on contrary, they need to use these times to improve their knowledge related to their fields. Therefore, they can turn this COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity for themselves.

AB Recently, manuscripts that use bioinformatics tools to convert proteins and other biological materials into music have appeared in several journals. The authors claim that this type of studies adds joy to education of life sciences and attract public attention to biochemistry education along with other uses. We thought the reverse of the process might also be possible for the purpose. We converted notes into amino acids depending on the decreasing hydrophobicity and by using the famous nursery song "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" notes, a hypothetical protein sequence was obtained. Three-dimensional structures were modeled by I-Tasser Protein Structure and Function Prediction server and the structure of the possible models were investigated. This Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) approach may bring fun to protein structure education. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 1-3, 2019.

ID SELF-ASSESSMENT
AB We describe an advanced, inquiry driven undergraduate course in Cancer Biology that combines faculty lectures typical of undergraduate courses with literature-driven discussions typical of graduate courses. As a capstone course, one goal of this course is to integrate knowledge from previous coursework in physiology, cell and molecular biology, genetics, and chemistry, so that students acquire a state-of-the-art understanding of cancer and cancer treatment. A related goal is for students to learn, from the primary literature, how science is performed and how new scientific knowledge is used to improve cancer treatment. We report on the development of this course and the methods used to accomplish the course goals. We present the results of a 5-year survey that provides a detailed picture of the demographics of the class and demonstrates that the course results in improved understanding of both cancer biology and how science is performed. Student responses to our survey strongly support the use of original literature as a teaching tool. We suggest that incorporation of primary literature into advanced undergraduate science courses is an effective approach for improving scientific literacy.

AB Medical education has adopted various e-learning technologies to its aid. Addition of Google Classroom, introduced in 2014, as a Learning Management System (LMS) has provided a basic, easy to use platform. This study tested its efficacy in teaching a biochemistry module to first year MBBS students in an Indian medical school. Better access to learning material and supplementary teaching resources, helpfulness of immediate feedback, and learning outside of class environment were reported by students. Preference of mobile phone over laptop to access this LMS was reported. Use of this free to use LMS can be made, and especially in resource limited low and middle income countries, to encourage greater access to e-learning.

AB Microbiology as an academic discipline that does not have a long history, but the knowledge accumulated over the past three centuries is rather considerable, and courses in microbiology are commonly taught in colleges and universities throughout the world. In this article, many of the methods that can be used for teaching microbiology in a classroom and laboratory are discussed. In brief, these methods are limited only by the basic technical facilities to which one has access as well as one's own imagination and creativity. The problems, the academic teaching is facing in Saudi Arabia are discussed; most important of them are the use of new technology and avoiding plagiarism.

AB The Java software jBar consists of a graphical user interface that allows the user to customize and assemble an included script for R. The scripted R pipeline calculates means and standard errors/deviations for replicates of numerical bivariate data and generates presentations in the form of bar graphs. A two-sided Student's t test is carried out against a user-selected reference and p-values are calculated. The user can enter the data conveniently through the built-in spreadsheet and configure the R pipeline in the graphical user interface. The configured R script is written into a file and then executed. Bar graphs can be generated as static PNG, PDF, and SVG files or as interactive HTML widgets.

AB Understanding how to perform an enzyme assay is a critical learning skill in the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. Students in biochemistry typically have been exposed to the use of NMR spectroscopy as a tool to determine chemical structure, but rarely are they exposed to the utility of NMR to evaluate enzyme kinetics. Furthermore, coverage of NMR experiments utilizing "alternative nuclei", such as N-15, F-19, and P-31 may be neglected. Herein we report a simple P-31 NMR tube experiment that allows students to examine the enzyme kinetics and equilibrium constant of the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase.

AB Biocatalysis is a fundamental concept in biotechnology. The topic integrates knowledge of several disciplines; therefore, it was included in the course " design and optimization of biological systems" which is offered in the biochemistry curricula. We selected the ciliate tetrahymena as an example of a eukaryotic system with potential for the biotransformation of sterol metabolites of industrial interest; in particular, we focused on the conversion of cholesterol to provitamin D-3. The students work with wild type and recombinant strains and learn how sterol pathways could be modified to obtain diverse sterol moieties. During the course the students identify and measure the concentration of sterols. They also search for related genes by bioinformatic analysis. Additionally, the students compare biotransformation rates, growing the ciliate in plate and in a bioreactor. Finally, they use fluorescence microscopy to localize an enzyme involved in biotransformation. The last day each team makes an oral presentation, explaining the results obtained and responds to a series of key questions posed by the teachers, which determine the final mark. In our experience, this course enables undergraduate students to become acquainted with the principles of biocatalysis as well as with standard and modern techniques, through a simple and robust laboratory exercise, using a biological system for the conversion of valuable pharmaceutical moieties.

AB Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR analysis (ChIP-qPCR) is a widely used technique to study gene expression. A large number of students in molecular biology and more generally in life sciences will be confronted with the use of this technique, which is quite difficult to set up and can lead to misinterpretation if not carefully managed. This article describes a four-session laboratory practical designed for Masters students to introduce this technique. During the practical, students work in pairs. They extract chromatin from MCF-7 culture cells stimulated or not by estrogens, then immunoprecipitate the transcription factor estrogen receptor alpha using an antibody directed against it. Students then measure the enrichment of promoter DNA target sequences from the chromatin that coprecipitates by qPCR. These are two estrogen responsive genes, pS2 (trefoil factor one) and PGR (the progesterone receptor). They learn how to analyze their ChIP-qPCR data by two methods: percent input and fold enrichment, and are taught about the interpretation limits of these two calculation methods. Thus, this practical is a good framework for an in-depth discussion of how this technique can be used to study gene expression and for raising awareness of the importance of careful interpretation of results.

AB Inquiry-based learning (IBL) activities are complementary to the processes of laboratory discovery, as both are focused on producing new findings through research and inquiry. Here, we describe the results of student surveys taken pre- and postpractical to an IBL undergraduate practical on PCR. Our analysis focuses primarily student perceptions of knowledge acquisition and their ability to troubleshoot problems. The survey results demonstrate significant self-reported gains in knowledge related to DNA structure and PCR, and an increase in confidence with "troubleshooting problems during scientific experiments." We conclude that the IBL-based approach that combines PCR primer design with wet laboratory experimentation using student-designed primers, provides students a sense of confidence by imparting workplace and research skills that are integral to diverse forms and applications of laboratory practices.

AB Due to the growing incidence of diabetes in developed nations, there is a compelling case to be made for teaching graduate students more deeply about mechanisms underlying this disease. Diabetes is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and protein glycation via the covalent binding of glucose molecules. Albumin represents the major plasmatic protein and undergoes enhanced glycoxidative modifications in diabetic condition. La Reunion Island, a French department located in the Indian Ocean exhibit a growing incidence of diabetes. At the University of La Reunion, our research group named GEICO (Groupe d'Etude sur l'Inflammation Chronique et l'Obesite) participated to foster research and training in diabetes context and focuses on the impact of glycated albumin mediated oxidative stress on cell physiopathology. A laboratory course was designed by our group to introduce graduate students to cutting edge techniques in redox biology while providing insights into scientific processes and methods. This two weeks research laboratory training took place at CYROI, a local biotechnology center that provides advanced facilities for research, business, and education. Using histochemistry, molecular biology, biochemical techniques, student investigated oxidative damages in liver from leptin receptor deficient diabetic mice compared to control littermates. In addition, they used an in vitro model by assaying oxidative impact of glycated albumin on hepatoma carcinoma HepG2 cells. This article gives an overview of the organization and protocol used by the students during their two weeks training in the laboratory. Therefore, it may be helpful for teaching graduate students techniques used in research laboratory working on redox biology.

AB Recently, 57 undergraduate students at the University of Michigan were assigned the task of solving a crystal structure, given only the electron density map of a 1.3 angstrom crystal structure from the electron density server, and the position of the N-terminal amino acid. To test their knowledge of amino acid chemistry, the students were not given the protein sequence. With minimal direction from the instructor on how the students should complete the assignment, the students fared remarkably well in this task, with over half the class able to reconstruct the original sequence with over 77% sequence identity, and with structures whose median ranked in the 91st percentile of all structures of comparable resolution in terms of structure quality. Fourteen percent of the students' structures produced Molprobity steric clash validation scores even better than that of the original structure, suggesting that multiple students achieved an improvement in the overall structure quality compared to the published structure. Students were able to delineate limiting case chemical environments, such as charged interactions or complete solvent exposure, but were less able to distinguish finer details of hydrogen bonding or hydrophobicity. Our results prompt several questions: why were students able to perform so well in their structural validation scores? How were some students able to outperform the 88% sequence identity mark that would constitute a perfect score, given the level of degenerate density or surface residues with poor density? And how can the methodology used by the best students inform the practices of professional X-ray crystallographers?

AB Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified within the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. SNPs present in the genomes of two isogenic C. elegans strains have been routinely used as a tool in forward genetics to map a mutation to a particular chromosome. This article describes a laboratory exercise in which undergraduate students use molecular biological techniques to map a mutation to a chromosome using a set of SNPs. Through this multi-week exercise, students perform genetic crosses, DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, restriction enzyme digests, agarose gel electrophoresis, and analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Students then analyze their results to deduce the chromosomal location of the mutation. Students also use bioinformatics websites to develop hypotheses that link the genotype to the phenotype.

AB The ability to read, interpret, and evaluate articles in the primary literature are important skills that science majors will use in graduate school and professional life. Because of this, it is important that students are not only exposed to the primary literature in undergraduate education, but also taught how to read and interpret these articles. To achieve this objective, POGIL activities were designed to use the primary literature in a majors biochemistry sequence. Data show that students were able to learn content from the literature without separate activities or lecture. Students also reported an increase in comfort and confidence in approaching the literature as a result of the activities.

ID GLUCOSE-OXIDASE
AB This article presents a problem-based learning (PBL) approach to teaching elementary biochemistry to undergraduate students. The activity was based on the foods we eat. It was used to engage students' curiosity and to initiate learning about a subject that could be used by the future teachers in the high school. The experimental activities (8-12 hours) were related to the questions: (i) what does the Benedict's Reagent detect? and (ii) What is determined by glucose oxidase (GOD)? We also ask the students to compare the results with those obtained with the Lugol reagent, which detects starch. Usually, students inferred that the Benedict reagent detects reducing sugars, while GOD could be used to detect glucose. However, in GOD assay, an open question was left, because the results could be due to contamination of the sugars (particularly galactose) with glucose. Though not stressed, GOD does not oxidize the carbohydrates tested and all the positive results are due to contamination. The activities presented here can be easily done in the high school, because they are simple and non-expensive. Furthermore, in the case of Benedict reaction, it is possible to follow the reduction of Cu (II) macroscopically by following the formation of the brick-orange precipitate. The concrete observation of a chemical reaction can motivate and facilitate students understanding about chemistry of life.

AB Over the past two years, through an NSF RCN UBE grant, the ASBMB has held regional workshops for faculty members and science educators from around the country that focused on identifying: 1) core principles of biochemistry and molecular biology, 2) essential concepts and underlying theories from physics, chemistry, and mathematics, and 3) foundational skills that undergraduate majors in biochemistry and molecular biology must understand to complete their major coursework. Using information gained from these workshops, as well as from the ASBMB accreditation working group and the NSF Vision and Change report, the Core Concepts working group has developed a consensus list of learning outcomes and objectives based on five foundational concepts (evolution, matter and energy transformation, homeostasis, information flow, and macromolecular structure and function) that represent the expected conceptual knowledge base for undergraduate degrees in biochemistry and molecular biology. This consensus will aid biochemistry and molecular biology educators in the development of assessment tools for the new ASBMB recommended curriculum.

AB A team of students, educators, and researchers has developed new materials to teach cell signaling within its cellular context. Two nontraditional modalities are employed: physical models, to explore the atomic details of several of the proteins in the angiogenesis signaling cascade, and illustrations of the proteins in their cellular environment, to give an intuitive understanding of the cellular context of the pathway. The experiences of the team underscore the use of these types of materials as an effective mode for fostering students' understanding of the molecular world and the scientific method used to define it.

AB Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses are routinely used in biology laboratories to detect aggregates in macromolecular solutions, to determine the size of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes or to monitor the binding of ligands. This article is written for graduate and undergraduate students with access to DLS and for faculty members who wish to incorporate DLS into a lab activity, a practical course or research. It reviews the basic concepts of light scattering measurements and addresses four critical aspects of the analysis and interpretation of DLS results. To ensure reproducible quantitative data, attention should be paid to controlling the preparation and handling of proteins or assemblies because variations in the state of aggregation, induced by minor changes in experimental condition or technique, might compromise DLS results and affect protein activity. Variables like temperature, solvent viscosity, and inter-particle interactions may also influence particle size determination. Every point is illustrated by case studies, including a commercially available albumin, a small RNA virus isolated from plants, as well as four soluble proteins and a ribonucleoprotein assembly purified and characterized by students in the frame of their master degree.

TI The "Frankenplasmid" Lab AN INVESTIGATIVE EXERCISE FOR TEACHING
   RECOMBINANT DNA METHODS
SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Recombinant DNA; restriction mapping; plasmids; PCR
AB We describe an investigative laboratory module designed to give college undergraduates strong practical and theoretical experience with recombinant DNA methods within 3 weeks. After deducing restriction enzyme maps for two different plasmids, students ligate the plasmids together in the same reaction, transform E. coli with this mixture of ligated DNA, and plate the cells on media that specifically select for hybrid plasmids. The main goal of the assignment is for students to deduce the gene map of one hybrid "Frankenplasmid" using the LacZ phenotype of its transformants, PCR, and restriction mapping. Our protocol results in a number of possible outcomes, meaning that students are mapping truly unknown plasmids. The open-ended nature of this assignment results in an effective module that teaches recombinant DNA procedures while engaging students with its investigative approach, increasing complexity, and puzzle-like quality. Moreover, the modular design of the activity allows it to be adapted to a more limited schedule, introductory courses, or more advanced courses.

TI Understanding Fatty Acid Metabolism Through an Active Learning Approach
SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE active learning; PBL; medical biochemistry
AB A multi-method active learning approach (MALA) was implemented in the Medical Biochemistry teaching unit of the Biomedical Sciences degree at the University of Aveiro, using problem-based learning as the main learning approach. In this type of learning strategy, students are involved beyond the mere exercise of being taught by listening. Less emphasis is placed on transmitting information and the focus is shifted toward developing higher order thinking (analysis, synthesis, and evaluation). However, MALA should always involve clearly identified objectives and well-defined targets. Understanding fatty acid metabolism was one of the proposed goals of the Medical Biochemistry unit. To this end, students were challenged with a variety of learning strategies to develop skills associated with group conflict resolution, critical thinking, information access, and retrieval, as well as oral and written communication skills. Overall, students and learning facilitators were highly motivated by the diversity of learning activities, particularly due to the emphasis on correlating theoretical knowledge with human health and disease. As a quality control exercise, the students were asked to answer a questionnaire on their evaluation of the whole teaching/learning experience. Our initial analysis of the learning outcomes permits us to conclude that the approach undertaken yields results that surpass the traditional teaching methods.

AB New approaches are currently being developed to expose biochemistry and molecular biology undergraduates to a more interactive learning environment. Here, we propose a unique project-based laboratory module, which incorporates exposure to biophysical chemistry approaches to address problems in protein chemistry. Each of the experiments described herein contributes to the stepwise process of isolating, identifying, and analyzing a protein involved in a central biological process, prokaryotic translation. Students are provided with expression plasmids that harbor an unknown translation factor, and it is their charge to complete a series of experiments that will allow them to develop hypotheses for discovering the identity of their unknown (from a list of potential candidates). Subsequent to the identification of their unknown translation factor, a series of protein unfolding exercises are performed employing circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies, allowing students to directly calculate thermodynamic parameters centered around determining the equilibrium constant for unfolding as a function of denaturant (temperature or chemical). The conclusion of this multi-part laboratory exercise consists of both oral and written presentations, emphasizing synthesis of the roles of each translation factor during the stepwise process of translation.

AB Biochemistry is an important professional course to undergraduates majoring in rehabilitation therapy in medical colleges and universities. To deepen students' understanding of the taught content, enhance their application ability and cultivate their high-level thinking ability, we investigated the effect of integration of the nine-grid thinking model into the teaching process. With the inline and divergence of relevant knowledge as the guiding ideology, students' understanding of knowledge points was deepened through thinking visualization. According to the questionnaire survey, 75% of the students believed that the application of the nine-grid thinking model was an effective teaching method for improving the efficiency of teaching and enhancing the teaching effect. In addition, a team of four students from the investigated class were granted by the 2021 Shanxi University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program and awarded RMB 6000 as a research fund (20210563). According to them, the application of the nine-grid thinking model in teaching is of great significance for cultivating students' higher-order thinking ability. The findings of this study might provide a new, effective approach to college course teaching.

AB Background: Traditional teaching methods of biochemistry provide effective tools for knowledge transmission, but are considered less engaging with students. Smartphone applications may provide suitable alternatives to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional teaching methods.
   Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of smartphone applications as a complementary method for learning biochemistry.
   Methodology: A total of 32 students, from the College of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Bisha, Saudi Arabia, were recruited. Students used available mobile applications, and their performance was monitored through assignments, presentations, practical evaluations, and pre- and post-tests. A self-administered structured questionnaire was used to survey the students' perceptions. It was validated by students enrolled at the College of Applied Medical Science, interns, and medical educators. It was checked for item appropriateness and comprehensiveness using face and content validity.
   Results: Around 75% of the students found the mobile applications useful in learning biochemistry, 50% believed that they were easy to use and 100% believed that the breadth of the knowledge presented by these applications was comprehensive. The pedagogical effect of the use of mobile applications in learning biochemistry showed statistically significant differences in student performances post-use and pre-use of mobile applications with P values of 0.000, 0.028, 0.023, and 0.000 for tests, assignments, practical evaluation, and presentations, respectively.
   Conclusion: Students have a positive perception of the use of mobile applications, as it has significantly improved their academic performance in biochemistry.

AB The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at St. Mary's College of Maryland has scaffolded collaboration skills throughout the Biochemistry curriculum and developed several assessment tools to evaluate these skills. Biochemistry I and II have used team contracts at the beginning of extensive team projects where students identify their strengths, review expectations, and plan for group communication. At the conclusion of each project, each student assesses their own contributions and team members for various parts of the project. A common collaboration rubric was also applied in Biochemistry I and II as well as in two other courses, General Chemistry II Lab and Physical Chemistry I Lab, for students to evaluate themself and team members using the following subcategories: quality of work, commitment, leadership, communication, and analysis. In Biochemistry I and II, we used this rubric for multiple assignments that are part of the projects in the lecture courses. In the General Chemistry II Lab, we provided elements of this rubric within an evaluation form that reflects these collaboration attributes after each lab experience, so students can assess and report privately on their experiences as part of their collaboration grade for the course. A similar collaboration rubric is completed by students for each team-based laboratory within Physical Chemistry I. We also demonstrate different ways that instructors can use the data from these assessment tools. In our department, we are using these tools to frame the importance of collaboration skills and collecting data to inform our teaching of these skills. Preliminary data suggest that our curriculum is successfully teaching students how to be good collaborators.

AB The CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely used for editing genes in various organisms and is a very useful tool due to its versatility, simplicity, and efficiency. To teach its principles to post-graduate students we designed a laboratory activity to obtain and analyze PDS3 mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana plants consisting of: 1) Design of guide RNAs using bioinformatics tools; 2) plant transformation (which is optional depending on the length of the course); 3) observation and evaluation of the mutant's phenotypes in the Phytoene desaturase (PDS3) gene, which exhibit an albino phenotype and different degrees of mosaicism in the editing events we evaluated; 4) PCR amplification of a fragment that includes the mutated region followed by analysis of single-stranded DNA conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver nitrate staining to detect changes in the amplicon sequence due to gene editing. Through SSCP, the students were able to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous edited plants. A highlight feature of this protocol is the visualization and detection of the mutation/edition without sequencing the edited fragment.

AB Biochemistry graduates need to be creative, however assessing creativity requires the production of novelty, judged by or against that of peers. A related phenomenon is 'creative self-efficacy' (CSE) - one's self-belief in producing creative outcomes. CSE is a contributor to creativity, but is more easily assessed, and thus more amenable for targeting pedagogically. To investigate interactions between student CSE and the learning environment, a biochemistry laboratory exercise was deployed within a 'creative' module, wherein students created their own experimental protocols. Students completed questionnaires at the beginning and end of the module. Compared to 'control' modules lacking overtly creative activities, the creative module significantly increased students' perceptions of their own creativity and whether their studies had increased their creativity. Students' confidence in meeting degree learning outcomes (for instance the ability to work productively in a laboratory), and motivation to study, were also significantly increased. Marks attained from the creative exercise correlated with students' CSE, but surprisingly, students' expected marks correlated negatively with their CSE, implying they had a poor understanding of the relationship between creativity and success. Our results suggest that the learning environment can positively affect students' CSE, promoting academic attainment of learning outcomes, motivation, and their confidence as biochemists.

AB The purpose of this study was to map the research literature on Biochemistry education, covering the scientific production indexed on the Web of Science over the past 66 years. The open-source Bibliometrix R-package, an R-tool, was used to carry out the bibliometric analysis. Our results describe (1) how many articles were published per year and what is the annual average growth rate; (2) which are the core journals, authors, and publications in the field; (3) which countries and funding agencies contribute most to the development of research in the area; (4) the leading collaborative research and co-citation networks; (5) which articles were the most cited in the past 10 years; and (6) which are the trending topics in the field. Our main contribution is offering insights into the evolution of the field. Also, the use of a quantitative methodological design, which covers a large volume of publications, and could identify possible gaps in the area.

AB We present a course-embedded undergraduate research module that involves real-time polymerase chain reaction testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples. A positive control RNA was constructed and two RNA extraction methods were compared and a range of primers were available to compare. Using a combination of published protocols, we assembled a successful project that illustrated a topical exercise similar to real-world assay development. The exercise is aimed at upper-level undergraduates and requires 3 weeks of laboratory periods. The students were able to design and test experimental protocols, while learning about RNA detection. This project could be utilized in upper-level classes including molecular biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, or for independent research projects.

AB Many molecular biology and biochemistry instructors have altered their classroom behavior in favor of evidence-based, active learning instructional strategies. Overwhelming evidence confirms that lecture-only classrooms are detrimental to student learning outcomes, but we know less about the impact textbooks have on students outside the classroom. Two influential projects, the AP Biology redesign and Vision and Change, called for extensive restructuring of course content and hoped that textbooks would be restructured accordingly. This study evaluated all figures and tables from two introductory biology textbooks to quantify how well they implement recommendations from Vision and Change and AP Biology redesign. We documented significant differences among figures and tables when looking for experimental data, questions for students to answer, and quantitative interpretation. Using think-aloud interviews, we interrogated whether students engage differently with figures from the two textbooks. When figures provided take-home messages, students relied on written text rather than analyzing the graphical information for their understanding. Students frequently employed words from summaries within the figures to construct "inflated explanations" that mimicked comprehension.

AB The lack of an instructional definition of bioinformatics delays its effective integration into biology coursework. Using an iterative process, our team of biologists, a mathematician/computer scientist, and a bioinformatician together with an educational evaluation and assessment specialist, developed an instructional definition of the discipline: Bioinformatics is "an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with the development and application of algorithms that analyze biological data to investigate the structure and function of biological polymers and their relationships to living systems." The field is defined in terms of its two primary foundational disciplines, biology and computer science, and its interdisciplinary nature. At the same time, we also created a rubric for assessing open-ended responses to a prompt about what bioinformatics is and how it is used. The rubric has been shown to be reliable in successive rounds of testing using both common percent agreement (89.7%) and intraclass correlation coefficient (0.620) calculations. We offer the definition and rubric to life sciences instructors to help further integrate bioinformatics into biology instruction, as well as for fostering further educational research projects.

AB Ensuring undergraduate students become proficient in relating protein structure to biological function has important implications. With current two-dimensional (2D) methods of teaching, students frequently develop misconceptions, including that proteins contain a lot of empty space, that bond angles for different amino acids can rotate equally, and that product inhibition is equivalent to allostery. To help students translate 2D images to 3D molecules and assign biochemical meaning to physical structures, we designed three 3D learning modules consisting of interactive activities with 3D printed models for amino acids, proteins, and allosteric regulation with coordinating pre- and post-assessments. Module implementation resulted in normalized learning gains on module-based assessments of 30% compared to 17% in a no-module course and normalized learning gains on a comprehensive assessment of 19% compared to 3% in a no-module course. This suggests that interacting with these modules helps students develop an improved ability to visualize and retain molecular structure and function.

ID BIOLOGY; SKILLS
AB Flow cytometry is a versatile and high throughput technique for rapid and efficient biological testing. It requires a high level of conceptual, technical, and analytical skills to properly design experiments, effectively operate flow cytometry machines, and analyze the data. A lack of training and development of any of these three skills can result in underutilization and improper use of flow cytometric machines that can impede research progress. Often students develop these conceptual, technical, and analysis skills from trial and error, but many students either do not use this powerful flow cytometry technology, use it improperly or ineffectively, or give up using it without proper training and support. Here we report on a course which teaches flow cytometry skills to undergraduate and graduate students. The design of this course is unique in that it teaches conceptual, technical, and analytical skills related to flow cytometry in a full semester format. Undergraduate and graduate students reported significant increases in their confidence levels over the course of the semester. Here we provide our findings and resources for others who may want to implement a similar course.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been shown to increase student retention and learning in the biological sciences. Most CURES cover only one aspect of gene regulation, such as transcriptional control. Here we present a new inquiry-based lab that engages understanding of gene expression from multiple perspectives. Students carry out a forward genetic screen to identify regulators of the stationary phase master regulator RpoS in the model organism Escherichia coli and then use a series of reporter fusions to determine if the regulation is at the level of transcription or the post-transcription level. This easy-to-implement course has been run both as a 9-week long project and a condensed 5-6week version in three different schools and types of courses. A majority of the genes found in the screen are novel, thus giving students the opportunity to contribute to original findings to the field. Assessments of this CURE show student gains in learning in many knowledge areas. In addition, attitudinal surveys suggest the students are enthusiastic about the screen and their learning about gene regulation. In summary, this lab would be an appropriate addition to an intermediate or advanced level Molecular Biology, Genetics, or Microbiology curriculum.

AB A single semester molecular biology laboratory has been developed in which students design and execute a project examining transcriptional regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three weeks of planning are allocated to developing a hypothesis through literature searches and use of bioinformatics. Common experimental plans address a cell process and how three genes that encode for proteins involved in that process are transcriptionally regulated in response to changing environmental conditions. Planning includes designing oligonucleotides to amplify the putative promoters of the three genes of interest. After the PCR, each product is cloned proximal to b-galactosidase in a yeast reporter plasmid. Techniques used include agarose electrophoresis, extraction of DNA from agarose, plasmid purification from bacteria, restriction digestion, ligation, and bacterial transformation. This promoter/ reporter plasmid is then transformed into yeast. Transformed yeast are cultured in conditions prescribed in the experimental design, lysed and beta-galactosidase activity is measured. The course provides an independent research experience in a group setting. Notebooks are maintained on-line with regular feedback. Projects culminate with the presentation of a poster worth 60% of the grade. Over the last three years, about 65% of students met expectations for experimental design, data acquisition, and analysis.

AB We explored the social shaping of science at the microlevel reality of face-to-face interaction in one of the traditional places for scientific activities-the scientific lab. We specifically examined how doctoral students ' perception of their: (i) interaction with doctoral mentors (MMI) and (ii) lab social environment (LSE) influenced productivity. Construed as the production of peer-reviewed articles, we measured productivity using total number of articles (TOTAL), number of articles with impact factor greater than or equal to 4.00 (IFGE4), and number of first-authored articles (NFA). Via face-to-face interviews, we obtained data from n=210 molecular biology Ph. D. students in selected universities in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Additional productivity data (NFA) were obtained from online bibliometric databases. To summarize the original 13 MMI and 13 LSE semantic-differential items which we used to measure students ' perceptions, principal component (PC) analyses were performed. The results were smaller sets of 4 MMI PCs and 4 LSE PCs. To identify which PCs influenced publication counts, we performed Poisson regression analyses. Although perceived MMI was not linked to productivity, perceived LSE was linked: Students who perceived their LSE as intellectually stimulating reported high levels of productivity in both TOTAL and IFGE4, but not in NFA. Our findings not only highlight how students ' perception of their training environment factors in the production of scientific output, our findings also carry important implications for improving mentoring programs in science.

AB Participating in undergraduate research can be a pivotal experience for students in life science disciplines. Development of critical thinking skills, in addition to conveying scientific ideas in oral and written formats, is essential to ensuring that students develop a greater understanding of basic scientific knowledge and the research process. Modernizing the current life sciences research environment to accommodate the growing demand by students for experiential learning is needed. By developing and implementing a structured, theory-based approach to undergraduate research in the life sciences, specifically biochemistry, it has been successfully shown that more students can be provided with a high-quality, high-impact research experience. The structure of this approach allowed students to develop novel, independent projects in a computational molecular modeling lab. Students engaged in an experience in which career goals, problem-solving skills, time management skills, and independence in a research lab were developed. After experiencing this approach to undergraduate research, students reported feeling challenged to think critically and prepared for future career paths. The approach allowed for a progressive learning environment where more undergraduate students could participate in publishable research. Future areas for development include implementation in a bench-top lab and extension to disciplines beyond biochemistry. In this study, it has been shown that utilizing the structured approach to undergraduate research could allow for more students to experience undergraduate research and develop into more confident, independent life scientists well prepared for graduate schools and professional research environments.

AB Modern biotechnology is one of the most important scientific and technological revolutions in the 21st century, with an increasing and measurable impact on society. Development of biotechnology curriculum has become important to high school bioscience classrooms. This study has monitored high school students in Taiwan on their knowledge of and attitudes towards biotechnology for nearly two decades. Not surprisingly, knowledge of biotechnology of current students has increased significantly (p<0.001) and most students have learned some definitions and examples of biotechnology. There was a positive correlation between biotechnology knowledge and attitudes toward biotechnology for current students who study Advanced Biology (AB). However, for current students who did not study AB, there was a negative correlation. The attitude results showed that students today expressed less favorable opinions toward agricultural biotechnology (p < 0.001) despite studying AB or not. However, there is no significant difference between students today and 18 years ago in opinions towards medical biotechnology. In addition, current students showed a greater concern involving environmental risks than former students. Interestingly, the high school curriculum did affect students' attitudes toward genetically engineered (GE) plants but not GE animals. Our current study also found that the students' attitude towards GE animals was influenced more by their limited knowledge than by their moral belief. On the basis of findings from this study, we suggest that more materials of emerging animal biotechnology should be included in high school curriculum and recommend that high school teachers and university faculty establish a collaborative framework in the near future.

AB Increasing student participation in science is an ongoing challenge for many universities. In this active learning workshop, centered on inquiry and teamwork, we introduce high-school students to biochemistry and molecular biology techniques using a murder mystery activity. During this intensive 3 hr workshop, we engage students in a murder scenario entitled The Case of the Silenced Scientist. A commercially available DNA fingerprinting kit was used as a basis to create a customized scenario whereby students collaborate with one another to solve a murder mystery. Through analysis of DNA samples taken from the crime scene and suspects, students can identify the murderer while developing technical, teamwork, and critical thinking skills. Emphasis is placed on teamwork by immersing students in the collaborative process of research inquiry. Though short in duration, this workshop aims to build student relationships to science through creativity and exploration. In this article, we describe the key customized applications of this workshop as a blueprint for science recruitment. We focus on the workshop facilitators' perceived learning impact on students.

AB The laboratory setting is an exciting and gratifying place to teach because you can actively engage the students in the learning process through hands-on activities; it is a dynamic environment amenable to collaborative work, critical thinking, problem-solving and discovery. The guided inquiry-based approach described here guides the students through their laboratory work at a steady pace that encourages them to focus on quality observations, careful data collection and thought processes surrounding the chemistry involved. It motivates students to work in a collaborative manner with frequent opportunities for feedback, reflection, and modification of their ideas. Each laboratory activity has four stages to keep the students' efforts on track: pre-lab work, an in-lab discussion, in-lab work, and a post-lab assignment. Students are guided at each stage by an instructor created template that directs their learning while giving them the opportunity and flexibility to explore new information, ideas, and questions. These templates are easily transferred into an electronic journal (termed the E-notebook) and form the basic structural framework of the final lab reports the students submit electronically, via a learning management system. The guided-inquiry based approach presented here uses a single laboratory activity for undergraduate Introductory Biochemistry as an example. After implementation of this guided learning approach student surveys reported a higher level of course satisfaction and there was a statistically significant improvement in the quality of the student work. Therefore we firmly believe the described format to be highly effective in promoting student learning and engagement.

AB A misconception regarding the human metabolism has been shown to be widespread among high school students. The students consider glucose as the sole metabolic fuel, disregarding that lipids and amino acids can be oxidized for ATP production by human cells. This misconception seems to be a consequence of formal teaching in grade and high schools. The present study reports the evaluation of a teaching strategy based on the use of a dialogic teaching methodology within a conceptual change approach to remediate that misconception. Students were stimulated to formulate hypotheses, outline experiments, and to discuss their outcomes. The results showed that students were able to reformulate their original concepts immediately after teaching. The majority of the students showed adequate learning of the topic eight months after the application of the teaching strategy, although some level of misconception recurrence was observed. The educational consequences of the teaching unit are discussed in the context of the possible reasons for its success as well as the need for similar initiatives at grade school to avoid the establishment of the misconception.

AB This article describes a 13-week laboratory course called Human Toxicology taught at the University of Otago, New Zealand. This course used a guided inquiry based laboratory coupled with formative assessment and collaborative learning to develop in undergraduate students the skills of problem solving/critical thinking, data interpretation and written discussion of results. The laboratory practices were a guided inquiry based around retinol's ability to potentiate acetaminophen-mediated hepatotoxicity. To induce critical thinking, students were given a choice as to which assay they could use to determine how retinol affected acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Short summaries were handed in following each assay and formed the bases of the formative assessment. To complete the feedback loop, a summative assessment that consisted of all the graphs and concepts from the short summaries were combined into a manuscript. To give the students exposure to science communication, the manuscript had to be written in accordance to the submission guidelines for Toxicological Sciences. Evaluation of this course was determined by a student questionnaire using a Likert scale and students' responses were very favorable. While the subject matter was toxicological centric, the content could be easily modified to suit another subject matter in biochemistry and molecular biology.

AB Genome scale experiments routinely produce large data sets that require computational analysis, yet there are few student-based labs that illustrate the design and execution of these experiments. In order for students to understand and participate in the genomic world, teaching labs must be available where students generate and analyze large data sets. We present a microarray-based gene expression analysis experiment that is tailored for undergraduate students. The methods in this article describe an expression analysis experiment that can also be applied to CGH and SNP experiments. Factors such as technical difficulty, duration, cost, and availability of materials and equipments are considered in the lab design. The microarray teaching lab is performed in two sessions. The first is an introductory wet bench exercise that allows students to master the basic technical skills. The second builds on the concepts and skills with students acquiring and analyzing the microarray data. This lab exercise familiarizes students with large-scale data experiments and introduces them to the initial analysis steps.

AB Gel electrophoresis is the single most important molecular biology technique and it is central to life sciences research, but it is often too expensive for the secondary science classroom or homeschoolers. A simple safe low-cost procedure is described here that uses household materials to construct and run DNA gel electrophoresis. Plastic containers are fitted with aluminum foil electrodes and 9-V batteries to run food-grade agar-agar gels using aquarium pH buffers and then stained with gentian violet. This activity was tested in a high school biology classroom with significantly positive responses on postactivity reflective surveys. The electrophoresis activity addresses several Life Science Content Standard C criteria, including aspects of cell biology, genetics, and evolution. It also can be used to teach aspects of motion and force in the physical science classroom.

AB When students have varying prior knowledge, personalized instruction is desirable. One way to personalize instruction is by using adaptive e-learning to offer training of varying complexity. In this study, we developed a web-based adaptive tutor to teach PCR primer design: the PCR Tutor. We used part of the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives (the three cognitive processes: remember, understand, and apply) to design exercises of varying complexity. Using this method, we demonstrated that we were able to systematically categorize exercises. There was also a good learning effect and a positive student perception when using the PCR Tutor.

AB Molecular cloning skills are an essential component of biological research, yet students often do not receive this training during their undergraduate studies. This can be attributed to the complexities of the cloning process, which may require many weeks of progressive design and experimentation. To address this issue, we incorporated an immersive 12-week undergraduate research experience into an upper-level molecular microbiology course. Students completed two 6-week modules where the entire molecular cloning process was carried out for two sets of novel genes implicated in distinct biological processes, microbial cell division and bacterial pathogenesis. The first module trained students in molecular cloning experimental skills, and the second facilitated the application of these skills within a new biological context. Students designed and optimized primers targeted against specific genes, andthen PCR amplified, purified, and quantified the DNA of their gene of interest. Using a variety of strategies, students inserted these genes into expression plasmids to produce GFP and His-tag fusion proteins; this was tested through restriction digestion or colony PCR and verified by gel electrophoresis. At the end of each module, students were assessed on comprehension of biological concepts, professional laboratory note-keeping and scientific communication, and proficiencies in experimental procedures. The recombinant plasmids produced by the students directly contributed to ongoing research projects, and the molecular cloning skills learnt are applicable to many career and study options in molecular biology. Overall, this research experience trained students in professional molecular biology and microbiology practice and engages them in producing real-world research outcomes.

AB A participatory learning approach, combined with both a traditional and a competitive assessment, was used to motivate students and promote a deep approach to learning biochemistry. Students were challenged to research, author, and explain their own multiple-choice questions (MCQs). They were also required to answer, evaluate, and discuss MCQs written by their peers. The technology used to support this activity was Peer Wise a freely available, innovative web-based system that supports students in the creation of an annotated question repository. In this case study, we describe students' contributions to, and perceptions of, the Peer Wise system for a cohort of 107 second-year biomedical science students from three degree streams studying a core biochemistry subject. Our study suggests that the students are eager participants and produce a large repository of relevant, good quality MCQs. In addition, they rate the Peer Wise system highly and use higher order thinking skills while taking an active role in their learning. We also discuss potential issues and future work using Peer Wise for biomedical students.

AB Biochemistry is a challenging subject because student learning depends on the application of previously learned concepts from general chemistry and biology to new, biological contexts. This article describes the development of a multiple-choice instrument intended to measure five concepts from general chemistry and three from biology that are considered prerequisite for biochemistry learning. This instrument is specifically designed with a factor structure that includes three multiple-choice items for each of the eight concepts and the most common incorrect ideas that students could have as distractors. It can be used as a pretest to identify students' incorrect ideas about those concepts and to determine if instruction helps students overcome those incorrect ideas when used as a posttest. Results from a confirmatory factor analysis support a very good fit for an eight-factor solution. This manuscript represents a report on the current state of instrument development. We seek to share our methods and instrument design principles with the broader community.

AB An experiment is conducted, which in four 3 h laboratory sessions, introduces third year undergraduate Biochemistry students to the technique of real-time PCR in a biological context. The model used is a murine erythroleukemia cell line (MEL cells). These continuously cycling, immature red blood cells, arrested at an early stage in erythropoiesis, can be induced to progress further through the process by 72 h exposure to 1.8% DMSO. This gives a control cell sample and a DMSO-treated preparation. Students isolate RNA from both cell cultures, check its purity, yield and integrity by UV spectrophotometry and denaturing gel electrophoresis, then synthesized cDNA. The relative levels of three sequences: beta globin, amino levulinate synthase, and carbonic anhydrase-1 are estimated by real-time PCR, using 18S rRNA as the reference sequence. The changes in gene expression are robust and reproducible, enabling students to experience a "cutting edge" research technique in an undergraduate lab setting. While the undergraduate student experience in practical classes with such sensitive techniques is often mixed, the changes in gene expression in this model are sufficiently great that students can gain the satisfaction of consistent results. In addition they gain experience at setting up checks and controls at stages throughout a multistep process and an appreciation of the difference between a reaction which has gone to completion with one that is measured as a rate. This experiment would also complement cell biology projects involving red cell development. It could also be extended to more thoroughly investigate the technique of real-time PCR.

AB In Photobacterium, the flavin reductase encoded by luxG regenerates the reduced form of flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Reduced FMN is one of the substrates of the luciferase enzyme that catalyzes a light-emitting reaction. A set of experiments, that employs a luxG-expression plasmid construct (pGhis) and is suitable for an undergraduate laboratory course, is presented. Hexahistidine-tagged protein is expressed in E. coli from pGhis, with the T7 RNA polymerase/lac repressor induction system. Bacteria are lysed by sonication and the tag allows for purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. A gel filtration column is used to remove ions and the other small molecules. The Bradford assay, with multiwell plates and an automated plate reader, is used to identify protein concentration peaks from both columns. The concentration of purified enzyme is then calculated from its A(280) using the predicted extinction coefficient. Yield and purity are further assayed with SDS-PAGE. Activity of purified enzyme is measured with riboflavin or FMN as substrate. Reaction rate is quantified by monitoring decrease in A(340) as the redox partner, NADH, is oxidized.

AB Translational medicine (TM) is an interdisciplinary branch of biomedicine that bridges the gap from bench-to-bedside to improve global health. Fundamental TM skills include interdisciplinary collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving (4Cs). TM is currently limited in undergraduate biomedical education programs, with little patient contact and opportunities for collaboration between different disciplines. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel interdisciplinary challenge-based educational concept, grounded in the theoretical framework of experimental research-based education, to implement TM in undergraduate biomedicine and medicine programs. Students were introduced to an authentic clinical problem through an interdisciplinary session with patients, medical doctors, and scientists. Next, students collaborated in groups to design unique laboratory-based research proposals addressing this problem. Stakeholders subsequently rewarded the best proposal with funding to be executed in a consecutive interdisciplinary laboratory course, in which mixed teams of biomedicine and medicine students performed the research in a fully equipped wet laboratory. Written questionnaires and focus groups revealed that students developed 4C skills and acquired a 4C mindset. Working on an authentic patient case and the interdisciplinary setting positively contributed to communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving skills. Furthermore, students were intrinsically motivated by (i) the relevance of their work that made them feel taken seriously and competent, (ii) the patient involvement that highlighted the societal relevance of their work, and (iii) the acquisition of a realistic view of what doing science in a biomedical research laboratory is. In conclusion, we showcase a widely applicable interdisciplinary challenge-based undergraduate concept fostering TM.

AB One significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for educators in forensic science was adapting what is traditionally a very applied field to a virtual learning environment. Because of this, science classes with a practical laboratory component had to implement significant adjustments to ensure that student learning objectives were still met, including practical elements. To provide learners with an alternative to a traditional lab exercise in forensic entomology, we designed an exercise to be conducted completely remotely to instruct students in how to identify a real unknown specimen using a hypothetical phylogenetic tree they create. Students retrieved data and make predictions using public databases, generate phylogenies based off sequence data, and finally determine the identity of the unknown sequence provided. This lab replacement exercise has been adapted to be accessible to learners from different academic levels and takes the length of one two-and-a-half-hour lab period to complete. Through creating this resource, we have been able to link molecular systematics to forensic education and provide learners who download this publicly available exercise insight into how forensic questions are answered.

AB Multiple studies have shown that testing contributes to learning at all educational levels. In this observational classroom study, we report the use of a learning tool developed for a Genetics and Molecular Biology course at the college level. An interactive set of practice exams that included 136 multiple choice questions (MCQ) or matching queries was developed in the open-source Moodle platform. All MCQ questions contained four answer choices and configured for immediate feedback upon answering. Feedback consisted of providing the right answer and a short explanation of the learning objective examined. The interactive material was tested and refined for several semesters. Usefulness of this tool was assessed in two distinct settings: (1) during a face-to-face semester (Fall 2019) by comparing the grades in a final departmental exam between students who used the tool and those who did not, and (2) during an online semester (Fall 2020) by analyzing the grades in the first and last attempts on study sessions and students' performance in monthly exams. We found that when solving practice tests, students obtained a significantly higher scores in the last attempt compared with their first attempt, and that students who used the material performed better than those who did not. In all cases, answering the practice exams was optional, but students made full use of them preferentially during the online semester. This classroom research exemplifies the documented effectiveness of practice tests enhanced with feedback in biological sciences education through an open-source learning platform.

AB Laboratory practical sessions are critical to scientific training in biology but usually fail to promote logical and hypothesis-driven reasoning and rely heavily on the teacher's instructions. This paper describes a 2-day laboratory practicum in which students prepare and analyze larval cuticle preparations of Drosophila segmentation gene mutant strains. Embryonic segmentation involves three major classes of genes according to their loss-of-function phenotypes: the establishment of broad regions by gap genes, the specification of the segments by the pair-rule genes, and the compartments within segments by the segment polarity genes. Students are asked to sort undefined segmentation mutants into gap, pair-rule, or segment polarity categories based on their knowledge of the Drosophila segmentation process and the microscopic anatomical traits they are capable of finding in the sample preparations. This technically simple practicum prompts students to pay attention to detailed observation to detect anatomic markers of intrasegmental compartments and thorax versus abdomen cuticle, and promote their logical reasoning in hypothesizing to which segmentation type a given mutant fits best.

AB COVID 19 has changed about every aspect of life including how we teach in higher education. Laboratory experiments vital for learning hands-on techniques are limited due to social distancing requirements and increased numbers of distance-learning students. The solution to loss of hands-on activities has been to compensate with virtual laboratory modules. Although virtual labs are engaging and offer a simulated hands-on approach to teaching essential molecular techniques, these simulations do not replace hands-on experience. I designed two molecular biology laboratory exercises in response to the current teaching limitations that can be completed 'at-home' and enable low cost hands-on instruction of essential molecular techniques in any distance-learning environment including during the COVID 19 pandemic.

AB Like many institutions around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to shift our summer 2020 in-person undergraduate experiential learning program to a remote, virtual format. Here, we present our observations, summarized in 10 best practices, for moving a STEM-focused research experience for undergraduates, experiential learning program or research-based course online. We will also discuss how our program was originally designed and implemented, and how we adapted our activities to deliver an at-home research experience that maintained student engagement, mentorship, and a shared sense of community.

AB This study aimed to examine the effect of the problem-based learning (PBL) on science attitudes of middle school students from low socio-economic status families. For this purpose, two intact classes of the same teacher were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups. In the unit of genetics, the experimental group was taught by PBL while the control group received traditional instruction. Students' attitudes were measured in terms of adoption of scientific attitudes, enjoyment of science lessons, and career interest in science administering a self-report instrument as a pre-test and a post-test. Results showed that after the treatment, although there were not statistically significant differences between two groups with respect to attitude toward science; in the experimental group, the mean scores were found to be consistently higher across all attitude dimensions compared to the control group. In addition, the mean scores suggested an improvement in the attitudes of experimental group students from pre-test to post test. Qualitative findings also revealed that students found PBL enjoyable. According to PBL students, searching for information and writing reports were among the features of the PBL contributing to their learning the most.

AB DNA analysis is a common diagnostic tool in healthcare: ranging from microbial typing (e.g. DNA strands of viral, bacterial and even fungal pathogens), oncological screen (e.g. Breast cancer detection via DNA analysis of any BRCA gene mutations), genetic amniocentesis test (a medical technique used in determining chromosomal conditions such as down syndrome in the fetus) and a host of other medical diagnostics based on the knowledge of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the genetic information carried in this macromolecule. However, such a wide-range of medical diagnostic mechanisms using DNA begs the question: How much does the undergraduate health sciences and/or non-major students understand about the basic biochemical properties of DNA? Here, a virtual lab module was used (with the addition of Pre and Post Lab Questions and a Discussion Topic relating DNA to Healthcare) along with a learning management system, to help undergraduate health sciences students visualize the biochemical properties of DNA molecule, such as binding constant and Gibbs free energy of binding. This lab was adapted to offer a platform on which an Instructor can design steps for students to explore the DNA nucleotide binding module during a time in which social distance curricula is necessary.

AB Colleges and educational institutions throughout the globe have adapted a pseudo-online educational model. This is also evident in health sciences courses designed for biochemical and chemical education. Biochemistry (along with general, organic and analytical) education is significant in the basic prerequisite education of undergraduate health sciences and non-majors curriculum, including a selection of human physiology and nutrition courses. Providing practical and empirical experiences for students enrolled in chemistry for health professions course is essential, even in this time of uncertainty. Here an option for a simple and safe, comprehensive virtual learning experience on carbohydrates and chemistry topics in connection with healthcare was developed by complementing an existing virtual lab collection and implementing this approach in an undergraduate health sciences (non-majors) course. Student responses to this online learning approach were recorded in a post-lab survey.

AB In this study, a set of hybrid images was designed as a new and up-to-date unexamined type of external visual representations in the chemistry classroom. One challenging teaching theme was chosen ("Amino acids and proteins"), and the hybrid images were used among novices-primary school students. For the purpose of the study, two groups were formed: experimental and control. The experimental group was taught using the hybrid images, while the control group was subjected to a traditional approach. After conducting the experiment, no statistically significant difference in the average performances between the two groups was found. However, the experimental group outperformed the control group in several test items. Additionally, misconceptions appeared within the C group. The results showed that several hybrid images with a potentially good methodological design might help students to develop conceptual understanding of some important concepts of amino acids and proteins (e.g., formation of peptide bonds).

AB This manuscript presents a scoping review of Biotechnology Education Research (BTER) over the last 20 years. BTER during this period primarily focused on attitudes and knowledge, typically using research design methods suitable for addressing questions about frequencies, central tendencies, correlations, and so on. However, to guide the development of educational practices that will increase and sustain students' motivation and interest in science in general and biotechnology in particular, BTER will need to adopt research design methods that support the inference of causal relationships from observations. Research will need to focus on students' interest and motivation, and its relationship with effective teaching and learning of biotechnology in the context of socio-scientific issues (SSIs). Such a shift will increase interest and motivation in teaching and learning biotechnology and will also help establish and maintain students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) because biotechnology is an important STEM subject. This in turn may encourage students to choose educational and professional careers in science, helping to meet society's current and future needs.

ID PHOSPHORYLATION
AB Understanding redox reactions in biochemistry requires a clear grasp of three definitions: electron exchange, oxidation number, and oxygen atom insertion. Here, the electrochemical cell is explained for redox-active ions, introducing a new comparison between the measurement of midpoint potential and the measurement of initial velocity for enzymes. Oxygen atom insertion is shown to be of use in readily classifying oxidation states. Finally, the use of several of these ideas is combined into an explanation of proton motive force development in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

AB The teaching of quantitative genetic variation in the undergraduate laboratory practical environment can be difficult as, for quantitative phenotypes that are under the control of multiple loci, detection of phenotypic differences caused by individual variants is problematical without large samples, impractical in such classes. Pet dogs provide a clear example of quantitative genetic variation with individual breeds ranging in size from 1 to 70 kg weight yet with little intrabreed variability. In contrast to humans where there are few identified genetic variants known to be involved in the genetically controlled size phenotype, in dogs, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes have been demonstrated to explain half of the phenotypic variance. In the practical described here, a single G-A SNP (within intron 2 of the insulin-like growth factor 1 gene) is studied through PCR, sequencing, and bioinformatics. Average breed weight of dogs of different genotypes at this SNP show significant differences in size (median [IQR] of AA = 10 kg [6-15 kg], AG = 23.75 kg [14-30 kg], GG = 30 kg [24.5-37 kg] from our class data) with an estimate of just approximate to N = 16 dogs needing to be genotyped to demonstrate a significant difference in size between dogs harboring the two homozygous genotypes. In the practical described herein, from a single laboratory and a single computer session, students are able to see the clear effect of genotype on a quantitative trait. Examination of the variant in the Ensembl browser () allows students to understand the genomic basis of this variant and appreciate the wealth of data and information publicly available in genome browsers.

AB Metabolic control analysis (MCA) is a promising approach in biochemistry aimed at understanding processes in a quantitative fashion. Here the contribution of enzymes and transporters to the control of a given pathway flux and metabolite concentrations is determined and expressed quantitatively by means of numerical coefficients. Metabolic flux can be influenced by a wide variety of modulators acting on one or more metabolic steps along the pathway. We describe a laboratory exercise to study metabolic regulation of human erythrocytes (RBCs). Within the framework of MCA, students use these cells to determine the sensitivity of the glycolytic flux to two inhibitors (iodoacetic acid: IA, and iodoacetamide: IAA) known to act on the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase. Glycolytic flux was estimated by determining the concentration of extracellular lactate, the end product of RBC glycolysis. A low-cost colorimetric assay was implemented, that takes advantage of the straightforward quantification of the absorbance signal from the photographic image of the multi-well plate taken with a standard digital camera. Students estimate flux response coefficients for each inhibitor by fitting an empirical function to the experimental data, followed by analytical derivation of this function. IA and IAA exhibit qualitatively different patterns, which are thoroughly analyzed in terms of the physicochemical properties influencing their action on the target enzyme. IA causes highest glycolytic flux inhibition at lower concentration than IAA. This work illustrates the feasibility of using the MCA approach to study key variables of a simple metabolic system, in the context of an upper level biochemistry course.

AB Contemporary biology is currently undergoing a revolution, driven by the availability of high-throughput technologies and a wide variety of bioinformatics tools. However, bioinformatics education and practice is still in its infancy in most of the African continent. Consequently, concerted efforts have been made in recent years to incorporate bioinformatics modules into biological sciences curriculum of African Universities. Despite this, one aspect of bioinformatics that is yet to be incorporated is structural bioinformatics. In this article, we report on a structural bioinformatics project carried out by final year project students in a Nigerian university. The target protein was the thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 1 (SIRV1) Rep protein, which was further characterized using various free, user-friendly and online sequence-based and structure-based bioinformatics tools. This exercise gave students the opportunity to generate new data, interpret the data, and acquire collaborative research skills. In this report, emphasis is placed on analysis of the data generated to further encourage analytical skills. By sharing this experience, it is anticipated that other similar institutions would adopt parallel strategies to expose undergraduate students to structural biology, and increase awareness of freely available bioinformatics tools for tackling pertinent biological questions.

AB We have developed an OD3R method that can be applied on Biochemistry learning. This OD3R consists of 5 phases: orientation, decision, do, discuss, and reflect to connect lessons in the class with practice in the laboratory. Implementation of OD3R method was done in 2 universities in Yogyakarta to increase critical thinking skill and practical skill of the students. The critical thinking skills were assessed using modified Hoyo rubric according to student's ability in writing laboratory work report. Practical skill was assessed using a rubric with 6 practical skill categories: procedural skill, manipulative skill, observation skill, drawing skill, interpretation skill, and presentation skill. Implementation result shows that OD3R method can increase critical thinking skill and practical skill of the students. OD3R method is a learning method that is centered on the students and can be recommended to train thinking skill and practical skill of students in University.

AB The purpose of the research was to compare the effects of two different techniques of the cooperative learning approach, namely Team-Game Tournament and Jigsaw, on undergraduates' conceptual understanding in a Hormone Biochemistry course. Undergraduates were randomly assigned to Group 1 (N=23) and Group 2 (N=29). Instructions were accomplished using Team-Game Tournament in Group 1 and Jigsaw in Group 2. Before the instructions, all groups were informed about cooperative learning and techniques, their responsibilities in the learning process and accessing of resources. Instructions were conducted under the guidance of the researcher for nine weeks and the Hormone Concept Test developed by the researcher was used before and after the instructions for data collection. According to the results, while both techniques improved students' understanding, Jigsaw was more effective than Team-Game Tournament.

AB In the present article, a scheme that summarizes the biochemical events occurring in the human body after the consumption of a meal is proposed. The scheme illustrates the metabolic sequence as a series of counteracting components occupying opposite positions in a cycle, indicating their opposite actions or physiological states, such as meal versus energy consumption, increase versus decrease of blood glucose levels, and excretion of insulin versus excretion of glucagon. Furthermore, the cycle is complemented by a table indicating the acceleration or inhibition of selected metabolic pathways and actions. Since the cycle demonstrates the effects of a meal and of insulin on metabolism it was named the meal-insulin cycle. Evaluation of the implementation in the classroom by postgraduate students of Nutrition showed that the proposed summarized visualization improved the understanding of the events between meals of all students, both holders of a Nutrition degree as well as graduates of another science division. Moreover, the representation as a perpetuating cycle throughout our lifespan was new to the students. The students recognized the graphical illustration as the most helpful feature. The proposed scheme may be used in teaching metabolism or biochemistry in a students' course or in a diabetes care course, it can be found on the internet, at the URL and is linked to an interactive map of metabolic pathways.

AB Integration of research experience into classroom is an important and vital experience for all undergraduates. These course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have grown from independent instructor lead projects to large consortium driven experiences. The impact and importance of CUREs on students at all levels in biochemistry was the focus of a National Science Foundation funded think tank. The state of biochemistry CUREs and suggestions for moving biochemistry forward as well as a practical guide (supplementary material) are reported here.

AB Laboratory-based practical classes are a common feature of life science teaching, during which students learn how to perform experiments and generate/interpret data. Practical classes are typically instructional, concentrating on providing topic- and technique-specific skills, however to produce research-capable graduates it is also important to develop generic practical skills. To provide an opportunity for students to develop the skills needed to create bespoke protocols for experimental benchwork, a traditional practical was repurposed. Students were given a list of available resources and an experimental goal, and directed to create a bench protocol to achieve the aim (measuring the iron in hemoglobin). In a series of teaching events students received feedback from staff, and peers prototyped the protocols, before protocols were finally implemented. Graduates highlighted this exercise as one of the most important of their degrees, primarily because of the clear relevance of the skills acquired to professional practice. The exercise exemplifies a range of pedagogic principles, but arguably its most important innovation is that it repurposed a pre-existing practical. This had the benefits of automatically providing scaffolding to direct the students' thought processes, while retaining the advantages of a discovery learning exercise, and allowing facile adoption of the approach across the sector.

AB We selected diabetes mellitus for this laboratory exercise to provide students with an explicit model for scientific research concerning the association between the R230C polymorphism and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is highly prevalent in the Mexican population. We used a collaborative project-based learning to engage students to direct their own learning process. Students worked in small groups with the same learning goal to research, organize data, and present seminars to experimentally genotype the C230 variant and correctly interpret their results. At the conclusion of this laboratory exercise, the students were able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the relevant biological molecular principles to genotype the C230 variant, showed technical competency to carry out the experimental protocols with proficiency, and interpret their results using statistical analyses. The students discussed their understanding of the genetic technologies and the broader social and ethical implications of the research. A randomly selected team was trained to work as a sentinel to monitor their classmates and ensure the proper application of techniques. Moreover, the evaluation of this exercise is shared between the students and the instructors; the students evaluate their own work and the performance of their classmates. At the end of the course, the students complete a questionnaire to anonymously provide feedback and information regarding their perception of the learning outcomes. Overall, the student feedback was positive, indicating that the exercise was useful and that it would help to prepare the students for professional practice.

AB Because understanding the structure of biological macromolecules is critical to understanding their function, students of biochemistry should become familiar not only with viewing, but also with generating and manipulating structural representations. We report a strategy from a one-semester undergraduate biochemistry course to integrate use of structural representation tools into both laboratory and homework activities. First, early in the course we introduce the use of readily available open-source software for visualizing protein structure, coincident with modules on amino acid and peptide bond properties. Second, we use these same software tools in lectures and incorporate images and other structure representations in homework tasks. Third, we require a capstone project in which teams of students examine a protein-nucleic acid complex and then use the software tools to illustrate for their classmates the salient features of the structure, relating how the structure helps explain biological function. To ensure engagement with a range of software and database features, we generated a detailed template file that can be used to explore any structure, and that guides students through specific applications of many of the software tools. In presentations, students demonstrate that they are successfully interpreting structural information, and using representations to illustrate particular points relevant to function. Thus, over the semester students integrate information about structural features of biological macromolecules into the larger discussion of the chemical basis of function. Together these assignments provide an accessible introduction to structural representation tools, allowing students to add these methods to their biochemical toolboxes early in their scientific development.

AB Epigenetic inheritance is the inheritance of genetic information that is not based on DNA sequence alone. One type of epigenetic information that has come to the forefront in the last few years is modified DNA bases. The most common modified DNA base in nature is 5-methylcytosine. Herein, we describe a laboratory experiment that combines bioinformatic and molecular approaches to study the presence and abundance of 5-methylcytosine in different organisms. Students were originally provided with the protein sequence of the Xenopus laevis DNMT1 cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase and used BLASTP searches to detect the presence of protein orthologs in the genomes of several organisms including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Students generated hypotheses regarding the presence and abundance of 5-methylcytosine in these organisms based on their bioinformatics data, and directly tested their predictions on a subset of DNAs using restriction enzyme isoschizomer assays. A southern blotting assay to answer the same question is also presented. In addition to exposure to the field of epigenetics, the strengths of the laboratory are students are able to make predictions using bioinformatic tools and quickly test them in the laboratory. In addition, students are exposed to two potential misinterpretations of bioinformatic search data. The laboratory is easily modified to incorporate outside research interests in epigenetics.

AB This laboratory exercise demonstrates three different analytical forms of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that allow students to genotype themselves at four different loci. Here, we present protocols to allow students to a) genotype a non-coding polymorphic Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) locus on human chromosome 5 using conventional PCR, b) perform PCR - Restriction Fragment Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis to genotype a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) of the TAS2R38 gene on human chromosome 7 and c) perform duplex Allele Specific Primer-PCR (ASP-PCR) to genotype SNPs of two enzyme-encoding genes in a single biochemical pathway on human chromosomes 4 and 12. All PCR reactions have been optimized to use a single easily purified sample of the students' own DNA and run under a single thermal cycler program using inexpensive reagents to produce robust and clearly interpretable results on a single agarose gel. As presented here, the lab occupies two lab periods of 2 h, 40 min each: DNA purification followed by PCR reactions set-up on Day 1 and enzyme digestion of the PCR-RFLP and agarose gel analysis on Day 2.

AB We examined the relationship between sense of professional identity and academic success among under-represented minority graduate students in a biomedical doctoral program. We found that a sense of professional identity is related to science success among under-represented minority students, but not for non-underrepresented minority students. Sense of professional identity appears to be linked to the use of mentors and to development as a scientist and member of the professional community, rather than someone who simply performs laboratory experiments.

AB Engaging undergraduate students in designing and executing original research should not only be accompanied by technique training but also intentional instruction in the critical analysis and writing of scientific literature. The course described here takes a rigorous approach to scientific reading and writing using primary literature as the model while simultaneously integrating laboratory instruction on basic enzyme purification and characterization, followed by 6 weeks of laboratory dedicated to student-designed original research projects. In the preparation and execution of their original projects, students engage in analysis of the primary literature, proposal writing, peer review, manuscript preparation, and oral presentation. The result is a comprehensive and challenging course that teaches third- and fourth-year undergraduates what it means to "think and work like a scientist."

AB The need for a revised curriculum within the life sciences has been well-established. One strategy to improve student preparation in the life sciences is to redesign introductory courses like biology, chemistry, and physics so that they better reflect their disciplinary interdependence. We describe a medically relevant, context-based approach to teaching second semester general chemistry that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of biology and chemistry. Our innovative method provides a model in which disciplinary barriers are diminished early in the undergraduate science curriculum. The course is divided into three principle educational modules: 1) Fundamentals of General Chemistry, 2) Medical Approaches to Inflammation, and 3) Neuroscience as a connector of chemistry, biology, and psychology. We accurately anticipated that this modified approach to teaching general chemistry would enhance student interest in chemistry and bridge the perceived gaps between biology and chemistry. The course serves as a template for context-based, interdisciplinary teaching that lays the foundation needed to train 21st century scientists.

AB Research-based learning in a teaching environment is an effective way to help bring the excitement and experience of independent bench research to a large number of students. The program described here is the second of a two-semester biochemistry laboratory series. Here, students are empowered to design, execute and analyze their own experiments for the entire semester. This style of laboratory replaces a variety of shorter labs in favor of an in depth research-based learning experience. The concept is to allow students to function in independent research groups. The research projects are focused on a series of wild-type and mutant clones of malate dehydrogenase. A common research theme for the laboratory helps instructors administer the course and is key to delivering a research opportunity to a large number of students. The outcome of this research-based learning laboratory results in students who are much more confident and skilled in critical areas in biochemistry and molecular biology. Students with research experience have significantly higher confidence and motivation than those students without a previous research experience. We have also found that all students performed better in advanced courses and in the workplace.

AB Face-to-face bioinformatics courses commonly include a weekly, in-person computer lab to facilitate active learning, reinforce conceptual material, and teach practical skills. Similarly, fully-online bioinformatics courses employ hands-on exercises to achieve these outcomes, although students typically perform this work offsite. Combining a face-to-face lecture course with a web-based virtual laboratory presents new opportunities for collaborative learning of the conceptual material, and for fostering peer support of technical bioinformatics questions. To explore this combination, an in-person lecture-only undergraduate bioinformatics course was augmented with a remote web-based laboratory, and tested with a large class. This study hypothesized that the collaborative virtual lab would foster active learning and peer support, and tested this hypothesis by conducting a student survey near the end of the semester. Respondents broadly reported strong benefits from the online laboratory, and strong benefits from peer-provided technical support. In comparison with traditional in-person teaching labs, students preferred the virtual lab by a factor of two. Key aspects of the course architecture and design are described to encourage further experimentation in teaching collaborative online bioinformatics laboratories.

AB Process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL), is a group-learning method that contributes to the active participation of learners in learning/teaching environments. However, a standard process for using the POGIL in classes is not available. In addition, no systematic reviews using bibliometric analysis in the literature examine the studies concerning POGIL in terms of content and research trends. From this viewpoint, this study aimed to examine the documents related to POGIL with the bibliometric analysis method to contribute to the development of POGIL. It analyses the publications made about POGIL in the period between 1999 and 2023. A total of 179 publications available on the Web of Science were included in the study. It was found following the analyses that the publications were made in various research areas and were published in several journals. They were mostly published in the USA and the researcher with the greatest number of publications was Clifton L. Kussmaul.

DE computer-aided drug design; COVID-19; online education
AB The computer-aided drug design (CADD) course that spans biochemistry, computational chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and other cutting-edge sciences is considered an important course by pharmaceutical universities in China. The course teaches students how drugs bind to protein targets and exert their biological activities using computer tools, and covers the basic principles of drug development and optimization. Due to the lockdown and social distancing measures adopted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the CADD course in Shenyang Pharmaceutical University was briefly suspended. Thereafter, it was taught in the online mode by adopting a novel blended teaching method. Through a questionnaire survey and final report assessment, we found that blended teaching might provide an opportunity to stimulate greater motivation and interest in students as well as improve teaching effectiveness and learning outcomes of the course. This study describes how we conducted the CADD course during the COVID-19 period with the intention of providing a reference for other teachers to conduct similar courses.

TI Beating heart cells: Using cultured cardiomyocytes to study cellular
   structure and contractility in laboratory exercises
SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
DE actin filaments; cardiomyocyte; contraction; epinephrine
AB Heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, exhibit intrinsic contractility in vitro. We found that commercially-available mammalian cardiomyocytes serve as an excellent model system for studying the cytoskeleton and cellular contractility, fundamental topics in undergraduate cell and molecular biology courses. Embryonic rat cardiomyocytes were plated on cell culture dishes or glass coverslips and visualized using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. The cardiomyocytes began contracting within 1-2 days after plating and continued to contract for many weeks, allowing their use in multiple laboratory sessions. Following background reading and instruction, students fixed and triple-stained the cardiomyocytes to examine the relative distributions of actin filaments and microtubules and the position of nuclei. Analysis and image capture with fluorescence microscopy provided striking examples of highly organized cytoskeletal elements. Students then designed experiments in which cardiomyocyte intrinsic contractility was explored. Changes in contraction rates were examined after treatment with signaling molecules, such as epinephrine. The addition of epinephrine to the culture medium, within a usable concentration window, increased the rate of contraction. These adaptable exercises provide undergraduate cell and molecular biology students with the exciting opportunity to study cardiomyocytes using standard cell culture and microscopy techniques.

AB A curriculum description of a general introductory biology course titled "Introduction to Research Methods" is presented here. The course aims to provide a glimpse of biomedical research to students who have had no or limited exposure to research to encourage them to do research as freshmen. Thus, this course aims to better equip and invoke interest of high school and college students to undertake research by addressing specific knowledge gaps, recruiting students from underserved communities, and promoting teamwork, community learning, and equity. The course covers in broad strokes key topics like forming a hypothesis, chemical safety, research practices, chemical calculations, cloning and so forth, that is useful for undergraduate trainees initiated to research. The course also aims to put each topic in a social context that provides room for contemplating science for young trainee scientists thus addressing the gap between science and society. Student feedback reveals a positive learning experience and self-reported improvement of knowledge on the various topics taught. As a result, the concepts and pedagogical tools used in this course can be adapted to increase students' involvement and retainment in biomedical research from underrepresented communities.

AB The new curriculum of competency based medical education (CBME) implemented for phase1 medical undergraduates could not go on to completion due to the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The educational institutions therefore resorted to online teaching modalities over conventional class room teachings. Hence this study aimed to compare the academic performance of students between routine classroom teaching and online assisted teaching with assignments.94 phase 1 MBBS students admitted in the year 2019-2020 was divided into low (<50%), medium (51%-70%) and high performers (71%-100%) based on the average marks in the initial formative assessments. Academic performance of students in three types of teaching modalities namely classroom teaching (CRT), classroom teaching with assignment (CRA), and online assisted teaching (OAT) were compared using ANOVA. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to find the difference in marks between CRT and CRA which was calculated as gain 1 and that between OAT and CRT is gain 2. Out of 94 students, 19 were low performers, 53 were medium performers and 22 were high performers when grouped at baseline. All these groups performed significantly well with OAT compared to CRT and CRA. The overall performance of girls was found to be significantly higher. There was no significant difference between Gain 1 and Gain 2. All group of students scored high in assessments following online teaching compared to conventional classroom teaching. The gain of online teaching did not outweigh the conventional teaching methods implying that face to face lectures is still an effective teaching modality.

AB Along with the Covid-19 pandemic, universities in Turkey as well as all over the world have started to carry out their education activities with the distance education method. In this case, many difficulties were encountered in the application of the Biology course, which is one of the applied courses carried out in the laboratory. Virtual laboratory applications can be preferred especially in teaching abstract subjects that are difficult to understand such as respiration. The teacher can write the process steps and theory related to the experiment to be designed, and the students can follow these process steps and perform the experiment in an interactive way. In this way, students can have a real-like laboratory experience by following the experimental procedure with laboratory materials step by step.

AB Oxidation number (ON) is taught as an electron-counting concept for redox reactions in chemistry curriculum. The molecular formula method, the Lewis formula method, and the structural formula method have all been used to determine ON. However, the task of assigning ON still poses problems for some teachers and students. This paper explores a new method, the fragmentation method, which is a visual approach for counting the individual ON of any atom according to its structural formula. The critical step is to break the carbon-heteroatom bond into organic fragments and inorganic fragments. The individual ON of carbon atoms and heteroatoms can be determined by the bond cleavages in the organic and biological compounds. The mean ON of carbons can be calculated by the arithmetic mean of all individual ON of carbons in a molecule or molecular ion. The step-by-step operating procedures and examples are provided. When comparing corresponding molecules in organic conversions, the change of individual ON of atoms can be used as a tool for determining the number of transferred electrons. Furthermore, a reaction site can be identified by their changes of individual ON, chemical composition, and bond order in metabolic redox reactions.

AB A complex research project was translated into a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE), which was implemented in sections of an introductory Cell and Molecular Biology laboratory course. The research laboratory generated an engineered plant line producing a growth-inhibiting, lipid-derived plant hormone and mutagenized this line. Students in the CURE cultured the mutagenized plant population and selected and characterized suppressor mutants. They learned to observe phenotypes related to the biosynthesis and perception of the plant hormone and explored the genetic and biochemical basis of these phenotypes. As the students studied the relevant genetic, molecular and biochemical concepts during this CURE, they were able to translate this knowledge into practice and develop scientific arguments. This CURE was a successful collaboration between the teaching lab and the research lab. It benefited both parties as the students had a real-life, deep learning experience in scientific methodology, while the research lab gathered data and materials for further studies.

AB Molecular biology is an important course for medical postgraduates to understand the practice of modern molecular medicine. At present, molecular biology has been widely used in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of clinical medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic forced all universities suspending academic activities and online teaching all over the world, which is a kind of crisis and has become people's memory of the times. The efforts from all sectors of society, include government, research institutions, and enterprises, have gave medical students a profound impact. The integration of memory of the times into molecular biology teaching will enhance students' learning interest and understanding effect.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent need for engaging computational alternatives to traditional laboratory exercises. Here we introduce a customizable and flexible workflow, designed with the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 in mind, as a means of reinforcing fundamental biology concepts using bioinformatics approaches. This workflow is accessible to a wide range of students in life science majors regardless of their prior bioinformatics knowledge, and all software is freely available, thus eliminating potential cost barriers. Using the workflow can thus provide a diverse group of students the opportunity to conduct inquiry-driven research. Here we demonstrate the utility of this workflow and outline the logical steps involved in the identification of therapeutic or vaccine targets against SARS CoV-2. We also provide an example of how the workflow may be adapted to other infectious microbes. Overall, our workflow anchors student understanding of viral biology and genomics and allows students to develop valuable bioinformatics expertise as well as to hone critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while also creating an opportunity to better understand emerging information surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Students always encounter difficulties in studying biochemical pathways. They are especially weak in understanding the relationships between metabolic pathways and their integration because these pathways are always taught one-by-one in class. In the past, various online resources have been developed to facilitate students' understanding toward energy metabolism. Although these learning materials enable students to understand individual metabolic pathway in a clearer manner, many of them fail to demonstrate the linkages between these pathways. The "AG City" is a self-learning tool which aims to arouse students' interest in exploring nucleotide metabolism. We have designed a metro map as a concept map to allow students to have an overview of different pathways as well as their integration. Major pathways are presented as railway lines in an easy-to-understand and interactive manner using navigation, animations, and narrations. Key molecules involved in the pathways are presented as "railway stations". Students can easily identify common "railway stations" presented in different pathways and link the concepts that they have learnt together. This interactive self-learning tool has been packaged as a courseware using the Articulate Storyline eLearning authoring software.

AB Recently, Chinese medical education has exhibited a shifting trend from teacher-centered instruction to student-centered learning, which usually includes a self-directed learning process. Providing students with high-quality and appropriate supplemental resources is necessary for their self-directed learning. This study aimed to investigate the appropriateness of AccessMedicine, an online medical resource, for first-year medical students at Tongji University in China. In the randomized controlled trial, 42 students were stratified by gender and grade point average (GPA) and randomly assigned to either the control group or AccessMedicine group. The students' learning outcomes were assessed with quizzes, including tests before and after learning and a final examination. Paired t-tests and two-way analysis of variance were performed for statistical analysis. We found that AccessMedicine-assisted learning improved student performance on tests and decreased the overall failure rate in the final examination. Further analysis showed that the final examination score of the subgroup with high GPAs in the AccessMedicine group significantly increased, but not that of the subgroup with low GPAs, indicating that AccessMedicine-assisted learning was more beneficial for good students than for poor students. A survey showed that professional vocabularies were the greatest obstacles to learning with AccessMedicine. Moreover, English language skills greatly affected the students' learning outcomes for the English resource but not those for the Chinese resource. Taken together, our results demonstrated that AccessMedicine was appropriate for Chinese medical education and improved the learning outcomes of students, especially students with high GPAs and a good command over the English language.

AB Scientific articles have been explored as a didactic resource in the teaching of Biochemistry, as well as in other areas of science. This teaching strategy contributes to the learning and understanding of specific concepts, and development of the skills, necessary for the research training of students. The present study investigated the use of scientific articles in the Topics in Metabolism course, which was offered to Biochemistry graduate students, at the University of Sao Paulo. Instead of lectures and seminars, two main activities were used: directed study (DS) and discussion groups (DG). Both utilized and explored high impact publications with a recognized quality of intellectual production. In this active learning environment, the objective was to evaluate the perception of the students regarding the teaching strategy, and the level of effort each student expended to understand the course material. Data collection involved using the responses to open and closed questions, from two questionnaires. Then the Pirouette software was employed to perform the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). The results indicated that 78% of the students had a positive perception of the teaching strategy and struggled less to understand the course material. On the other hand, 22% of the students had a less positive perception of the strategy and displayed a less intense course engagement. Ultimately, the results presented in the present study indicate that the adoption of this teaching strategy can help graduate students to develop the ability to read critically and thoroughly understand scientific materials, which are fundamental skills for future researchers.

AB We describe an interactive module that can be used to teach basic concepts in electrochemistry and thermodynamics to first year natural science students. The module is used together with an experimental laboratory and improves the students' understanding of thermodynamic quantities such as Delta(r)G, Delta H-r, and Delta S-r that are calculated but not directly measured in the lab. We also discuss how new technologies can substitute some parts of experimental chemistry courses, and improve accessibility to course material. Cloud computing platforms such as CoCalc facilitate the distribution of computer codes and allow students to access and apply interactive course tools beyond the course's scope. Despite some limitations imposed by cloud computing, the students appreciated the approach and the enhanced opportunities to discuss study questions with their classmates and instructor as facilitated by the interactive tools.

AB Homologous recombination, a central concept in biology, is defined as the exchange of DNA strands between two similar or identical nucleotide sequences. Unfortunately, undergraduate students majoring in biotechnology often experience difficulties in understanding the molecular basis of homologous recombination. In this study, we developed and implemented a 12-week laboratory course for biotechnology undergraduates in which gene targeting in Streptococcus suis was used to facilitate their understanding of the basic concept and process of homologous recombination. Students worked in teams of two to select a gene of interest to create a knockout mutant using methods that relied on homologous recombination. By integrating abstract knowledge and practice in the process of scientific research, students gained hands-on experience in molecular biology techniques while learning about the principle and process of homologous recombination. The learning outcomes and survey-based assessment demonstrated that students substantially enhanced their understanding of how homologous recombination could be used to study gene function. Overall, the course was very effective for helping biotechnology undergraduates learn the theory and application of homologous recombination, while also yielding positive effects in developing confidence and scientific skills for future work in research.

AB Systems biology is frequently taught with an emphasis on mathematical modeling approaches. This focus effectively excludes most biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology students, who are not mathematics majors. The mathematical focus can also present a misleading picture of systems biology, which is a multi-disciplinary pursuit requiring collaboration between biochemists, bioinformaticians, and mathematicians. This article describes an authentic large-scale undergraduate research experience (ALURE) in systems biology that incorporates proteomics, bacterial genomics, and bioinformatics in the one exercise. This project is designed to engage students who have a basic grounding in protein chemistry and metabolism and no mathematical modeling skills. The pedagogy around the research experience is designed to help students attack complex datasets and use their emergent metabolic knowledge to make meaning from large amounts of raw data. On completing the ALURE, participants reported a significant increase in their confidence around analyzing large datasets, while the majority of the cohort reported good or great gains in a variety of skills including analysing data for patterns and conducting database or internet searches. An environmental scan shows that this ALURE is the only undergraduate-level system-biology research project offered on a large-scale in Australia; this speaks to the perceived difficulty of implementing such an opportunity for students. We argue however, that based on the student feedback, allowing undergraduate students to complete a systems-biology project is both feasible and desirable, even if the students are not maths and computing majors.

AB To boost active learning in undergraduate students, they were given the task of preparing blogs on topics of clinical biochemistry. This experiment lasted for 12 teaching-semesters (from 2008 to 2013), and included a survey on the blogs' usefulness at the end of each semester. The survey (applied in the 2008-2010 period) used a Likert-like questionnaire with eight questions and a 1-to-6 scale, from totally disagree to fully agree. Answers of 428 students were analyzed and indicated overall approval of the blog activity: 86% and 35% of the responses scored 4-to-6 and 6, respectively. Considering the survey results, the high grades obtained by students on their blogs (averaging 8.3 in 2008-2010), and the significant increase in average grades of the clinical biochemistry exam after the beginning of the blog system (from 5.5 in 2007 to 6.4 in 2008-2010), we concluded that blogging activity on biochemistry is a promising tool for boosting active learning.

AB HIV protease has served as a model protein for understanding protein structure, enzyme kinetics, structure-based drug design, and protein evolution. Inhibitors of HIV protease are also an essential part of effective HIV/AIDS treatment and have provided great societal benefits. The broad applications for HIV protease and its inhibitors make it a perfect framework for integrating foundational topics in biochemistry around a big picture scientific and societal issue. Herein, I describe a series of classroom exercises that integrate foundational topics in biochemistry around the structure, biology, and therapeutic inhibition of HIV protease. These exercises center on foundational topics in biochemistry including thermodynamics, acid/base properties, protein structure, ligand binding, and enzymatic catalysis. The exercises also incorporate regular student practice of scientific skills including analysis of primary literature, evaluation of scientific data, and presentation of technical scientific arguments. Through the exercises, students also gain experience accessing computational biochemical resources such as the protein data bank, Proteopedia, and protein visualization software. As these HIV centered exercises cover foundational topics common to all first semester biochemistry courses, these exercises should appeal to a broad audience of undergraduate students and should be readily integrated into a variety of teaching styles and classroom sizes.

AB The development of fields such as bioinformatics and genomics has created new challenges and opportunities for undergraduate biology curricula. Students preparing for careers in science, technology, and medicine need more intensive study of bioinformatics and more sophisticated training in the mathematics on which this field is based. In this study, we deliberately integrated bioinformatics instruction at multiple course levels into an existing biology curriculum. Students in an introductory biology course, intermediate lab courses, and advanced project-oriented courses all participated in new course components designed to sequentially introduce bioinformatics skills and knowledge, as well as computational approaches that are common to many bioinformatics applications. In each course, bioinformatics learning was embedded in an existing disciplinary instructional sequence, as opposed to having a single course where all bioinformatics learning occurs. We designed direct and indirect assessment tools to follow student progress through the course sequence. Our data show significant gains in both student confidence and ability in bioinformatics during individual courses and as course level increases. Despite evidence of substantial student learning in both bioinformatics and mathematics, students were skeptical about the link between learning bioinformatics and learning mathematics. While our approach resulted in substantial learning gains, student buy-in and engagement might be better in longer project-based activities that demand application of skills to research problems. Nevertheless, in situations where a concentrated focus on project-oriented bioinformatics is not possible or desirable, our approach of integrating multiple smaller components into an existing curriculum provides an alternative.

AB The graduate medical students often get less opportunity for clarifying their doubts and to reinforce their concepts after lecture classes. Assessment of the effect of MCQ preparation by graduate medical students as a revision exercise on the topic Mineral metabolism. At the end of regular teaching module on the topic Mineral metabolism, graduate medical students were asked to prepare the stems of 15 MCQs based on the four discriminators given for each. They were told that one of the discriminators could be the answer for the MCQ and the remaining three could be the distracters. They were further guided in their task by providing few key word(s) in the stem of the expected MCQ. In the first phase of the exercise, the students attempted the MCQ preparation individually without peer consultation. In the second phase, the students participated in small group discussion to formulate the best MCQs of the group. The effects on low, medium, and high achievers were evaluated by pre and post-tests with the same set of MCQs. Both the individual endeavor in Phase 1 and small group discussion in Phase 2 for the formulation of MCQs significantly contributed to the gain from the exercise. The gains from the individual task and from small group discussion were equal among the different categories of students. Both phases of the exercise were equally beneficial for the low, medium, and high achievers. The high and medium achievers retained the gain from the exercise even after 1 week of the exercise whereas the low achievers could not retain the gain completely. Formulation of MCQs is an effective and useful unconventional revision exercise in Biochemistry for graduate medical students.

ID MISCONCEPTIONS; BIOLOGY
AB Chromosome structure is confusing to students at all levels, and chromosome behavior during meiosis is a notoriously difficult topic. Undergraduate biology majors are exposed to the process of meiosis numerous times during their presecondary and postsecondary education, yet understanding of key concepts, such as the point at which haploidy is established, does not improve substantially with repeated exposure. Based on student's drawings, 96% of intermediate-level biology majors have unclear or incorrect ideas about meiosis. Students have difficulty diagramming the process of meiosis starting with three unreplicated pairs of chromosomes, and even when they can produce an accurate diagram, they are unclear how to assign the terms "haploid" and "diploid." We designed an interactive lesson based on constructivist theory to address these issues in a large lecture class. Pretest and posttest scores showed a significant improvement in students' understanding of ploidy compared to a parallel class taught in the traditional way (e.g. using the textbook diagrams). In interviews afterward, those students whose scores improved on exams specifically pointed to the features of the in-class modeling that were deliberately incorporated for that purpose.

AB A strong, recent movement in tertiary education is the development of conceptual, or "big idea" teaching. The emphasis in course design is now on promoting key understandings, core competencies, and an understanding of connections between different fields. In biochemistry teaching, this radical shift from the content-based tradition is being driven by the "omics" information explosion; we can no longer teach all the information we have available. Biochemistry is a core, enabling discipline for much of modern scientific research, and biochemistry teaching is in urgent need of a method for delivery of conceptual frameworks. In this project, we aimed to define the key concepts in biochemistry. We find that the key concepts we defined map well onto the core science concepts recommended by the Vision and Change project. We developed a new method to present biochemistry through the lenses of these concepts. This new method challenged the way we thought about biochemistry as teachers. It also stimulated the majority of the students to think more deeply about biochemistry and to make links between biochemistry and material in other courses. This method is applicable to the full spectrum of content usually taught in biochemistry.

AB Detergent enzymes account for about 30% of the total worldwide production of enzymes and are one of the largest and most successful applications of modern industrial biotechnology. Proteases can improve the wash performance of household, industrial, and institutional laundry detergents used to remove protein-based stains such as blood, grass, body fluids, and food soils. This article describes two easy and cheap laboratory exercises to study the presence, profile, and basic enzymology of detergent proteases. These laboratory practicals are based on the determination of the detergent protease activity of various commercial detergents using the N-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide method and the bovine serum albumin degradation capacity. Students are also required to elucidate the enzymatic subtype of detergent proteases by studying the inhibitory potential of several types of protease inhibitors revealed by the same experimental methodology. Additionally, the results of the exercises can be used to provide additional insights on elementary enzymology by studying the influence of several important parameters on protease activity such as temperature (in this article) and the influence of pH and effects of surfactants and oxidizers (proposed). Students also develop laboratory skills, problem-solving capacities, and the ability to write a laboratory report. The exercises are mainly designed for an advanced undergraduate project in the biochemistry and biotechnology sciences. Globally, these laboratory practicals show students the biotechnological applications of proteases in the detergent industry and also reinforce important enzymology concepts.

DE NSF; undergraduate education in biology; funding; vision and change
AB The purpose of this short article is to (a) briefly summarize the findings of two important recent resources concerning the future of biology in the 21(st) century; one, Vision and Change, A Call to Action [AAAS, 2009. AAAS, Washington, DC], concerned with undergraduate education in biology, the other, A New Biology for the 21st Century [National Research Council, 2009. National Academies Press, Washington, DC], concerned with advances within the discipline itself; (b) urge you, the reader of BAMBED, to review the material on the Vision and Change website [AAAS, 2009. AAAS: Washington, DC] and then to think how you might change things at your own institution and within your courses, and; (c) make readers aware of the programs at the National Science Foundation (NSF) that might support change efforts, as well as refer you to efforts other funding agencies are making to help biology undergraduate education respond to the challenges and opportunities chronicled in these two reports. Although NSF funding opportunities are specifically available to US investigators, the recommendations of the two reports should be of interest to a wide spectrum of international researchers.

SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Nicotine; tobacco; acid-base titration; HPLC
AB The main objective of this experiment is to determine the amount of nicotine in commercial brand cigarettes by means of a nonaqueous acid-base titration. A simple glass device simulating a smoker is proposed, which allows the determination of the volatilized, filter retained, and inhaled portions. Students will readily see that the amount of nicotine/cigarette stated on the label (similar to 0.5-1.0 mg) refers indeed to the inhaled portion only, rather than to the total amount/cigarette (usually more than 10 mg). Even so, values for inhaled nicotine may be significantly higher than those reported for several brands. Students will also be able to make a critical evaluation of the true content of nicotine in the inhaled portion and confront it with the reported value for a given brand. In addition, the theoretical approach, supported by HPLC data, provides an excellent experience on nonaqueous acid-base volumetric analysis.

AB Practical instruction of proteomics concepts was provided using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a mass selective detection system (HPLC-MS) for the analysis of simulated protein digests. The samples were prepared from selected dipeptides in order to facilitate the mass spectral identification. As part of the prelaboratory preparation, students calculated the parent ion patterns of the dipeptides using peptide calculator websites. Following instruction on the use of the HPLC-MS instrument, students analyzed mixtures of the dipeptides and identified the individual dipeptides in the unknowns. In addition, purchased chicken egg white lysozyme alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin was analyzed using the same approach. Key tryptic peptides were identified from the HPLC-MS chromatogram with information generated with the FindPept tool. This experiment demonstrates that complex concepts can be taught in the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory using a problem-based approach.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate knowledge, opinions, and attitudes toward, as well as readiness to accept genetically modified organisms (GMOs) among prospective primary and secondary Slovene teachers. Our findings are that prospective teachers want to take an active role in rejecting or supporting individual GMOs and are aware of the importance of education about genetically modified organism (GMO) items and their potential significance for society. Through cluster analysis, we recognized four clusters of GMOs, separated by degree of genetically modified acceptability. GM plants and microorganisms which are recognized as useful are accepted. They are undecided about organisms used in research or medicine and reject organisms used for food consumption and for fun. There are only weak correlations between knowledge and attitudes and knowledge and acceptance of GMOs, and a strong correlation between attitudes and acceptance. The appropriate strategies and actions for improving university courses in biotechnology are discussed.

Additionally, proposing and testing a hypothesis is applicable not only to science, but also to ordinary facts of daily life. Knowing the way science is done and how its results are published is useful for all citizens and mandatory for science students. A 60-h course was created to offer undergraduate students a framework in which to learn the procedures of scientific production and publication. The course's main focus was biochemistry, and it was comprised of two modules. Module I dealt with scientific articles, and Module II with research project writing. Module I covered the topics: 1) the difference between scientific knowledge and common sense, 2) different conceptions of science, 3) scientific methodology, 4) scientific publishing categories, 5) logical principles, 6) deductive and inductive approaches, and 7) critical reading of scientific articles. Module II dealt with 1) selection of an experimental problem for investigation, 2) bibliographic revision, 3) materials and methods, 4) project writing and presentation, 5) funding agencies, and 6) critical analysis of experimental results. The course adopted a collaborative learning strategy, and each topic was studied through activities performed by the students. Qualitative and quantitative course evaluations with Likert questionnaires were carried out at each stage, and the results showed the students' high approval of the course. The staff responsible for course planning and development also evaluated it positively. The Biochemistry Department of the Chemistry Institute of the University of Sao Paulo has offered the course four times.

AB The theoretical basis of reactive oxygen species and their impact on health issues are relatively easy to understand by biomedical students. The detection of reactive oxygen species requires expensive equipment, the procedures are time consuming and costly, and the results are hard to interpret. Moreover, cause-and-effect relationships in the living system are not so evident. In this report, we adapted a two-step procedure to detect anion superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide generation in lymphocytes exposed to paraquat by using nitroblue tetrazolium salt and dihydrorhodamine, respectively. Also, a two-step assay was performed to evaluate lymphocyte viability and nuclei morphologic changes on paraquat exposure for 1 and 24 hours incubation time by using trypan blue exclusion assay and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining technique, respectively. Vitamin E was used as antioxidant to inhibit the deleterious effects of paraquat on cells. Students learned how to (i) design and perform experiments in the laboratory, (ii) read critical scientific literature, and (iii) discuss and contrast relevant information about reactive oxygen species as causative agents of cell death phenomenon.

AB The biochemistry and molecular biology of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is difficult to convey to students in a classroom setting in ways that capture their interest. The understanding of the matrix's roles in physiological and pathological conditions study will presumably be hampered by insufficient knowledge of its molecular structure. Internet-available resources can bridge the division between the molecular details and ECM's biological properties and associated processes. This article presents an approach to teach the ECM developed for first year medical undergraduates who, working in teams: (i) Explore a specific molecular component of the matrix, (ii) identify a disease in which the component is implicated, (iii) investigate how the component's structure/function contributes to ECM' supramolecular organization in physiological and in pathological conditions, and (iv) share their findings with colleagues. The approach designated i-cell-MATRIX is focused on the contribution of individual components to the overall organization and biological functions of the ECM. i-cell-MATRIX is student centered and uses 5 hours of class time. Summary of results and take home message: A "1-minute paper" has been used to gather student feedback on the impact of i-cell-MATRIX. Qualitative analysis of student feedback gathered in three consecutive years revealed that students appreciate the approach's reliance on self-directed learning, the interactivity embedded and the demand for deeper insights on the ECM. Learning how to use Internet biomedical resources is another positive outcome. Ninety percent of students recommend the activity for subsequent years. i-cell-MATRIX is adaptable by other medical schools which may be looking for an approach that achieves higher student engagement with the ECM.

AB Retrieval practice is an evidence-based approach to teaching; here, we evaluate the use of PeerWise for embedding retrieval practice into summative assessment. PeerWise allows anonymous authoring, sharing, answering, rating, and feedback on peer-authored multiple choice questions. PeerWise was embedded as a summative assessment in a large first-year introductory biochemistry module. Engagement with five aspects of the tool was evaluated against student performance in coursework, exam, and overall module outcome. Results indicated a weak-to-moderate positive but significant correlation between engagement with PeerWise and assessment performance. Student feedback showed PeerWise had a polarizing effect; the majority recognized the benefits as a learning and revision tool, but a minority strongly disliked it, complaining of a lack of academic moderation and irrelevant questions unrelated to the module. PeerWise can be considered a helpful learning tool for some students and a means of embedding retrieval practice into summative assessment.

AB Previously we identified that biomedical science students commonly misunderstand "creativity," mistaking it for "freedom." In the present study, we describe and evaluate a workshop designed to increase students' awareness of creativity as a highly sought-after employability skill and cognitive process applicable to scientific endeavors. To achieve this, we developed and introduced students to a process called the "Diamond Model," utilizing a case study to contextualize and signpost the creative processes of divergent and convergent thinking. This model was introduced to students in the first workshop of a 12-week undergraduate biochemistry unit (subject) within the Bachelor of Biomedical Science at Monash University, Australia. Students completed pre- and post-workshop surveys to gauge the impact of the workshop on their conceptions of creativity and Bloom's taxonomy of learning. In addition, reflective journals were completed by a small subset of students (n = 9) following the workshop. Following the workshop, over 65% of students indicated that their conception of creativity had changed. Thematic analysis of students' survey responses and reflections indicated that this change in the conception of creativity included broadening their definition of creativity, increased awareness of creativity as a skill and science as a creative process, and that creativity can be applied to different areas of life. Students attributed the signposting of creative elements as a contributing factor to their increased awareness. These results indicate the positive impact the workshop and our novel Diamond model had on student conception of creativity, highlighting the importance of explicit communication and signposting in skill development.

AB Coagulation is an important process in the context of water purification; and the seed protein of the moringa tree (Moringa oleifera) is a remarkably effective coagulant. The laboratory course described here is designed to provide high-school students with a stepwise, hands-on experience in investigating the protein-rich coagulant found in Moringa seeds. First, the seed powder was applied to model polluted water containing fine clay, food dyes, copper sulfate, and bacteria. This treatment changed the polluted water into clear water via coagulation; all students were convinced that the coagulation-inducing agent was a thermostable cationic protein. Finally, basic biochemical techniques (e.g., chromatographic separation and electrophoresis) were used to show that the target coagulant is a dimeric protein composed of 6.5 and 4.5 kDa subunits. Overall, this made it possible for the students to gain a deeper understanding (more comprehensive than the information taught in formal classes) of protein structure and its real-world implications. This stepwise exercise can be applied to research-based learning programs in high school, as it is an effective learning tool.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide an efficient mechanism to provide many students with an original research project. CUREs often culminate in a capstone poster presentation, but reports on these classes usually focus on the preparation and execution of the project rather than communication of the results. This article summarizes a CURE-associated research seminar that focuses on developing the communication and interpersonal skills required for the production and presentation of a conference poster. The class is designed to provide students with the tools and confidence for effective communication of their research. From the two class offerings to date, the 18 participating students have received five awards from 19 conference presentations.

AB A large body of literature has established the benefits of undergraduate research experiences via the traditional apprenticeship model. More recently, several studies have shown that many of these benefits can be recapitulated in course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) that are more scalable and easier for students to participate in, compared to the apprenticeship-based research experiences. Many Biology curricula also incorporate more traditional laboratory courses, where students learn to use common laboratory techniques through guided exercises with known outcomes. Indeed, many programs across the nation provide such programs or courses for students early in their careers, with a view toward increasing student interest and engagement in Biology. While there is general consensus that all lab experiences have some benefits for students, very few studies have examined whether either research experiences or learning biological techniques in more traditional lab courses directly impacts student performance in lecture courses. Here, we show that prior familiarity with laboratory techniques does not improve student performance in a lecture course, even if these techniques are directly related to content being taught in the course. However, having prior research experience improves performance in the course, irrespective of whether the research experience included the use of course-related laboratory techniques.

AB Medical research is important to scientific progress and medical education. Institutions worldwide have sought to increase student involvement in research such as clinician-scientists training programs, while little is known about how medical undergraduates perceive research. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China, with first-fourth year undergraduates. An online, anonymous, and self-rating 5-point Likert questionnaire was conducted to investigate medical undergraduates' demographic characteristics and assess motivation, self-efficacy, perception, curiosity, and barriers regarding medical research. Content validity was checked with experts and face validity was checked for clarity and understanding of the questionnaire. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the questions ranged from 0.813 to 0.879. A total of 3273 medical undergraduates were surveyed, and 86.62% (2835) participants (male 962, female 1873) were identified as effective. Males scored higher than females on self-efficacy (p < 0.001), perception (p = 0.017), and curiosity (p < 0.001), and lower on barriers (p < 0.001). The second year students are at the peak of their perception (p = 0.006) and lowest barrier scores (p = 0.003). Students with scientific research experience scored higher in motivation (p = 0.002), self-efficacy (p < 0.001), perception (p < 0.001), and curiosity (p < 0.001). Lack of proper mentoring opportunity (86.2%) and knowledge (84.5%) were the main barriers in conducting research. Even though they have a positive perspective, only a few undergraduates enrolled in research. Medical universities should encourage faculties to supervise and guide undergraduates' projects, and provide feasible solutions for students to learn scientific knowledge and skills. It is vital to build a research-oriented environment and academic atmosphere.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic related measures had augmented the rise of online education. While online teaching had mitigated the negative impacts from educational institutional closures, it was unable to displace hands-on biomedical laboratory practical lessons effectively. Without practical sessions, there was concern over the imparting of laboratory skills even with video demonstrations. To investigate the effectiveness of different delivery modes in imparting laboratory skills, theoretical and practical student assessments were analyzed alongside an anonymous survey on their motivation and prior experience. The undergraduate students were exposed to (1) instructor-live demonstration; (2) video demonstration or (3) no demonstration prior to the practical test which was a plasmid extraction. Significantly higher mini-prep yields and purity were found for both instructor-live and video demonstrations compared to no demonstration. Comparison with pre-pandemic theoretical assessment performance showed no significant differences despite longer contact hours during pre-pandemic times. Prior lab experience and motivation for selecting the course did not significantly affect student mini-prep yields. In conclusion, our findings suggest that video demonstrations were as effective as instructor-live demonstrations during the pandemic without noticeably compromising the teaching and learning of biomedical laboratory skills.

AB The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic results in the suspension of universities' academic laboratory activities. This brought a difficult time for graduate students majored in molecular biology and their mentors, since the student's thesis progress relies on the data from wet experiments in the lab. Even facing the challenges during the pandemic, mentors could still play an active role. This COVID-19 crisis requires mentors to have more thinking, innovation, and sharing in guiding graduate students.

AB To fully appreciate genetics, one must understand the link between genotype (DNA sequence) and phenotype (observable characteristics). Advances in high-throughput genomic sequencing technologies and applications, so-called "-omics," have made genetic sequencing readily available across fields in biology from applications in non-traditional study organisms to precision medicine. Thus, understanding these tools is critical for any biologist, especially those early in their career. This comprehensive review discusses the chronological development of different sequencing methods, the bioinformatics steps to analyzing this data, and social and ethical issues raised by these techniques that must be discussed and evaluated, including anticipatory guides and discussion questions for active engagement in the classroom. Additionally, the Supporting Information includes a case study to apply technical and ethical concepts from the text.

AB A computational biochemistry laboratory, fitted for bioinformatics students, is presented. The molecular dynamics package GROMACS is used to prepare and simulate a solvated protein. Students analyze the trajectory with different available tools (GROMACS and VMD) to probe the structural stability of the protein during the simulation. Students are also required to make use of Python libraries and write their own code to probe non-covalent interactions between the amino acid side chains. Based on these results, students characterize the system in a qualitatively approach but also assess the importance of each specific interaction through time. This work mobilizes biochemical concepts and programming skills, fostering critical thinking and group work and developing presenting skills.

AB The structure and function of biomolecules relationship is the hallmark of biochemistry, molecular biology, and life sciences in general. Physical models of macromolecules give students the possibility to manipulate these structures in three dimensions, developing a sense of spatiality and a better understanding of key aspects such as atom size and shape, bond lengths and symmetry. Several molecular model systems were developed specifically to represent particular classes or groups of molecules and hence lack the flexibility of a universal solution. Three-dimensional printing could nevertheless provide such a universal solution, as it can be used to create physical models of biomolecular structures based on the teacher's or demonstrator's needs and requirements. Here, insulin was used as a model molecule and several depiction and printing parameters were tested in order to highlight the technical limitations of the approach. In the end, a set of settings that worked is provided which could serve as a starting point for anyone wishing to print his or her own custom macromolecular model on the cheap.
