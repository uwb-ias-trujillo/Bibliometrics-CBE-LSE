SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; case study; genome analysis
AB COVID took over the world starting in 2020. Everyone quickly "knew" about the novel coronavirus, but how much do they actually know about the virus behind COVID-19? This classroom activity gives students real-world practice in evaluating actual genetic sequences from SARS-CoV-2 and working with genome alignments to identify mutations and cluster different emergence patterns. This activity works through alignments, mutations/variants, protein folding, structure and function, and medical/immunology implications of the different variants. There are seven parts to this activity, and each one can be incorporated alone into a lesson or collectively used for a lab, case study, or other supplemental activity to strengthen learning objectives in genetics, biology, immunology, and public health. This learning activity is scalable to different levels and has successfully been incorporated into K-12 education as well as college and graduate education.

DT Article
DE pipe cleaner; protein folding.
AB Proteins are challenging molecules for students to understand, consisting of multiple components interacting in a variety of ways. As instructors, we have observed this information is hard for students to process, both when learning about proteins initially in introductory classes, and when learning about specific details in upper-level courses. This pipe cleaner activity is designed for use in any science class that teaches protein folding, from upper-level high school through upper-level college courses. Pipe cleaners are a simple, familiar, and cost-effective manipulative model that can be used in multiple class types.

ID CONSERVATION; ATTITUDES; INSECTS
AB Ask most students to draw or color a bee, and their sketch will likely feature a large-bodied, circular, fuzzy, black and yellow striped insect resembling a bumblebee or indicating some honey-producing behavior. There is a large propensity for society to perceive of all bees in one generic group, as popular bee images across media are often portrayed morphologically and/or behaviorally incorrect, or misidentified entirely. By recognizing our own misperceptions, a focused drawing activity can provide the opportunity to introduce awareness and highlight the diversity of bees or other insects in an engaging manner.

AB We introduce biology to the artist's design tool, the storyboard. This versatile organizing and visualizing artistic platform is introduced into the biology classroom to aid in an inventive and focused discovery process. Almost all biological concepts are dynamic, and storyboards offer biology, lecture, wet and computational labs, flexibility, inventiveness, and an opportunity for students to slow down the so-called steps of biological processes and moderate their observations. Storyboarding is a thoughtful and reflective discovery device with enormous potential to break with traditional biology classroom experiences and return to the root of the educational process: storytelling. It will encourage teachers to embark on the remodeling of the biological curriculum with specific technical skills that students and teachers should consider developing to make the STEAM experience tailored to the uniqueness of biological systems. Storyboards offer hands-on, illustrative, and interactive conversations about biology concepts. They are an "unplugged" and contemplative experiences, organizing frameworks for personal expression focused on biological wonders.

TI Warming Up the Cold Call: Encouraging Classroom Inclusion by Considering
   Warm- & Cold-Calling Techniques

AB Student populations in higher education are more diverse than ever before. Studies of classroom engagement have repeatedly shown that instructors act on implicit biases and that classroom participation is rarely equitable. What can instructors do to support diverse students, specifically with regard to managing classroom engagement and facilitating equitable participation? The practice of cold-calling-calling on a student who has not volunteered to contribute a response-has previously been suggested to support a number of desirable classroom outcomes. However, cold-calling is increasingly recognized to be a potential source of significant student anxiety, particularly for students already experiencing heightened stress due to stereotype threat or other barriers to learning. As such, the solicitation of random and immediate feedback may actually exacerbate inequities rather than ameliorate them as intended.
   Here, we introduce a novel classroom participation approach that we call the warm call. This engagement method provides students with an advance warning, and the opportunity to opt out of sharing in front of the class. We describe two different approaches-the in-class warm call and the before-class warm call-which can be utilized by instructors in any level or size of class to support equitable student participation while also respecting student autonomy.

AB The authors of this article applied the determination of phenolic and flavonoid content in small berries to create a didactic cycle based on student-centered active learning (SCAL) in which students actively participated in the topic while studying and profile-forming as future biology and chemistry teachers. The fundamental part of the proposed didactic cycle is that students solve the following task: Determine the phenolic and flavonoid content in berries (Vaccinium myrtillus L., Vaccinium vitis-idaea L., and Vaccinium corymbosum L.) in your region. The submitted interdisciplinary topic is relevant to everyday life, and it aroused interest and enthusiasm among students. The students had the opportunity to test their theoretical knowledge in practical experimental research, and they attempted to work as researchers.

AB In an age-appropriate remote learning activity developed by a researcher-teacher team, junior high school students learned about the link between human health and food safety. The students were introduced to basic concepts about the innate immune system and food safety through a learning activity that focused on peanut allergens in food products. The students (a) learned how to distinguish between the concepts of immunity and allergy; (b) learned about cross-contamination and the link between allergies and food safety; (c) learned what antibodies are and how they can be used for science; (d) applied basic knowledge about the immune system and food safety to screen for peanut residues in suspect non-peanut food products using a commercial test kit; and (e) applied basic knowledge about the immune system and food safety to create individual poster presentations on other types of allergies, such as soy or dairy allergies.

TI The Goggle Lab: Using Impairment Goggles to Teach Science Competencies
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE science practices; nature of science; impairment goggles
AB In its 2011 report Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education, the American Association for the Advancement of Science emphasized the use of core concepts and competencies from multiple disciplines rather than focusing on rote memorization. After the publication of this document, many individuals, departments, and institutions started using course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURES) as one way to transition to the inclusion of core competencies. Well-executed CUREs focus students' learning of science practices around a project that relates to a real problem the students are helping solve. However, while CUREs are effective and can be fun for both students and instructors, not every instructor or institution has the time or the funding to engage students in a formal CURE project. This means finding alternative ways to incorporate teaching core competencies and science practices. We created the Goggle Lab to use impairment goggles, which simulate the effects of alcohol and other substances, in a general biology laboratory setting to teach core competencies and science practices, while injecting a dose of fun and integrating social issues. Students utilized the impairment goggles to design experiments, analyze data, practice basic statistics, and communicate scientific findings in a variety of formats.

TI Ease into Climate Change Instruction through Ocean Acidification
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE ocean acidification; climate change; carbon dioxide; pH; marine
   calcifers
AB Although climate change garners the bulk of headlines, ocean acidification is an equally important issue that also results from our increasing consumption of fossil fuels. As atmospheric CO2 dissolves into the ocean, the ocean's pH decreases, making it increasingly difficult for organisms that build calcium carbonate skeletons to grow and thrive. Given that these marine calcifiers - such as corals, snails, shellfish, crustaceans, and plankton - often form the base of oceanic food webs and are habitat and food resources for larger oceanic plants and animals (including humans), ocean acidification poses a serious threat. In this article, we present a series of investigations that provide evidence that increases in anthropogenic sources of CO2 contribute to the acidification of the ocean, and that an increasingly acidic ocean can negatively impact marine calcifiers.

AB Evolution by natural selection is key to understanding life and of considerable practical importance in public health, medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) include natural selection among several evolutionary concepts that all third-graders should know. This article explores a novel approach to developing and testing curricula for teaching natural selection and related concepts to children. College students developed lesson plans with specific evolutionary learning objectives based on the NGSS and taught them at elementary schools. Learning was assessed with a pre/post-test design, and a subset of students was retested after two years. After just two hours of instruction and active-learning activities, students of all three grade levels tested (grades 3-5) demonstrated substantial improvement in their understanding of evolutionary concepts. Students who were retested in grade 5 scored higher than fifth-graders who had not participated previously. The most challenging concepts for all grade levels were common ancestry and natural selection, but fifth-graders showed more improvement than third- and fourth-graders. If this finding is substantiated by further research, an adjustment to the NGSS schedule might be warranted. Spacing evolutionary biology concepts out might be a better strategy than concentrating them all in grade 3.

AB A challenge for introductory students in conservation biology is to understand how different environmental and human factors - in particular, density-dependent and density-independent factors - can interact to increase extinction risk in species. To enhance students' processing of sometimes thy and challenging material, we use a kinetic exercise in which students become an endangered animal, move around their environment, and act out a series of scenarios that highlight how species can be driven down a path toward extinction.

AB In recent years, providing authentic and unique research experiences for undergraduates has become increasingly important, yet many educational institutions struggle to provide their students with such experiences. Engaging students in hands-on research is meant to increase their problem-solving skills and help them learn how to work in a collaborative environment. Unfortunately, many students never receive a genuine research experience in their undergraduate biology courses. We developed a semester-long, laboratory-based research project in which students worked in groups to investigate the prevalence of fish mislabeling in local restaurants and grocery stores using DNA barcoding. During the experimental process, students learned fundamental molecular techniques like DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequence analysis. Students also developed soft skills linked to working in teams and science communication. Over the course of the project, students collected their own fish samples and were responsible for their team's lab workflow throughout the semester. Some groups (12/25) identified instances of mislabeling on the basis of DNA evidence. Students synthesized their results in a full scientific manuscript and ended the semester by disseminating their results in a class-wide poster symposium. Collectively, the students documented that similar to 21% (26/123) of the fish samples they had collected from local restaurants and at grocery stores in the Greater Lansing area were mislabeled. This project gave students the time and space needed to master molecular techniques (often through trial and error), and it engaged them in a place-based learning setting as they investigated the incidence of fish mislabeling in their local community.

ID ECOLITERACY; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; URBAN
AB Eco-literacy (knowledge of natural history, and direct observation of the natural world and the organisms it contains) is critical to a holistic understanding of biology. Many undergraduate biology students lack this knowledge and experience, often because of a lack of engagement with the environmental science curriculum. The effectiveness of service learning is well established, but few examples of service-learning projects in the context of natural history education have been published. We describe how we used best practices for the development of a field-based service-learning project in a college-level natural history course. The project was built around established learning goals and was conducted through a partnership with a local state park. Students worked in groups to conduct bird biodiversity surveys and prepared a printed bird-watching guide, which was presented to park staff. The project was linked to a series of assignments intended to maximize academic and personal growth, including a project plan, progress report, and reflection paper. Students reported increased engagement in the course curriculum and an increased sense of the relevance of the course content.

AB Biological experiments involving animals in K-12 classrooms can be time consuming or logistically difficult. Insects are small and easy to obtain, making them suitable for classroom use. We provide an experiment using insects that will teach students how to use the scientific method to formulate and test a hypothesis. The experiment is based on a case study involving an insect used as a biological control agent that targets an invasive weed, and the rigor of the experiment can easily be tailored to different grade levels. Using similar to 1 m(2) arenas set up in the classroom, students measure insect jumping or walking distances as a proxy for dispersal capabilities in the field, and more advanced classes can investigate variables that affect jumping or walking distance and direction.

AB Adapting research-driven routines to the classroom context can promote innovative and motivational learning environments. Using a case-study approach, we propose a set of bioinformatics-based activities supported by a tutorial video aiming to identify genes and disclosing their genomic context in different species. The rationale is to strengthen teachers' competencies to introduce bioinformatics resources and tools (e.g., NCBI, ORFinder, BLAST, and MaGe) in their teaching practices. By doing so, teachers will ultimately enhance students' understanding of how genomic data mining and comparative genomics are instrumental for biological research.

AB Heterophrynus batesii (the Giant Amazonian Whip Spider) are often referred to as "whip scorpions" or "whip spiders" because of their very long antenniform legs (i.e., whips), but they are neither scorpions nor spiders. They are amblypygids, a type of harmless charismatic arachnid with an alien-like appearance that students are drawn to. I have developed care and breeding techniques that are effective at getting H. batesii to live and reproduce in captivity. I developed these techniques with other science teachers in mind. These techniques are simple, time efficient, utilize the least expensive materials, and require minimal space-important characteristics since most high school biology teachers are limited by time, money, and space. This article instructs high school biology students (under the guidance of their teacher) how to properly care for and develop a captive breeding program for H. batesii in their high school biology classroom. Topics, resources, and activities are also suggested that allow teachers to make educational connections between the H. batesii captive breeding program, the ongoing sixth mass extinction, and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

AB The tools of molecular biology provide a rich platform for teaching the scientific process, as interesting questions pertaining to fields such as evolution and ecology can be pursued on short time scales. In this inquiry-based laboratory project, students investigate the authenticity of fish products purchased in local markets and restaurants by DNA sequence analysis of a segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. In the course of their investigation, students are exposed to fundamental molecular biology techniques such as DNA isolation, agarose gel electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing mechanisms, and DNA database analysis. In addition, students will observe how the evolutionary relatedness of species is reflected in the genetic code, and consider how the ecology of fish species influences their product distribution and environmental impact. This project is suitable for advanced high school or undergraduate students.

TI A Question-Based Approach to Teaching Photosynthesis, Carbohydrate

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE photosynthesis; carbohydrate partitioning; NGSS
AB To help high school students develop a deeper understanding of energy and matter flow in biological systems, a key goal of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), we have designed a series of inquiry-driven modules that experimentally explore photosynthesis in the context of carbohydrate partitioning. Carbohydrate partitioning refers to the distribution of photosynthesis products from source organs, such as leaves, to growing or storage tissues. These cost- and time-effective modules help students develop a more integrated understanding of how energy flows from light into leaves before moving outward to other parts of the plant and ultimately into other organisms. Our approach of teaching carbohydrate partitioning along with photosynthesis greatly expands the number of NGSS core ideas and cross-cutting concepts in an integrated manner, empowers students to see how photosynthesis and carbohydrate partitioning are central to their existence, and provides a rich platform for experimentally addressing questions related to photosynthesis, crop production, global climate change, plant physiology, and the carbon cycle.

DE databases; overpopulation; global population size; population clock;
   quantitative literacy; US population size
AB Global human population size and understanding how it has changed and will change in the future are important concepts for students. Here I describe exercises that use online databases provided by the U.S. Census Bureau to show students how both population size and the rate of change vary over time. In the first exercise, the U.S. population clock is used to calculate daily birth, death, and migrant and death rates, and how the world population clock is used to calculate the rate of change. These rates can be used to predict what the population size would be if the rates remained unchanged for a predetermined time interval. In the second exercise, historical data are used to determine the years with the most change in U.S. and world population size, then calculate how much larger the current population would be if those historical rates of change remained constant. These exercises have improved quantitative literacy while showing students current and historical trends in human population.

AB Teaching the techniques to collect and analyze data on wild populations presents many obstacles. Capturing, identifying, and collecting data from wildlife has many safety-related and logistical challenges. Pokemon GO, a relatively new, smartphone-based augmented reality game, provides a new landscape for simulating wildlife ecology research. The world of Pokemon GO is overlaid onto the physical world and is populated with a variety of species, each having biologically relevant characteristics. Each individual Pokemon also has unique morphometric data. These features of the game provide a platform for data collection and analysis that mimics real-world practices, while eliminating many logistical and safety-related constraints. Additionally, little to no training is involved to begin data collection, allowing more time to plan and execute simulated wildlife ecology projects and activities. The availability of this new virtual wildlife community provides a widely accessible, freely obtained resource for data collection that has directly relevant applications for wildlife ecology education.

DT Article

ID INSTRUCTION; MOTIVATION; CURRICULUM; ECOLOGY
AB Ecology may be seen as one of the main topics of biological education as it functions at the interface of several other aspects of biology. Although it may easily be conveyed through field trips and hands-on activities, it is taught theoretically most of the time and in traditional ecosystems like forests or lakes. For this study, new teaching material has been developed that demonstrates the exploration of more special or "atypical" ecosystems in biology classes. It combines working in a local vineyard with hands-on elements for school. By exploring a human-made ecosystem, which is different from those traditionally used, students gain content knowledge and get to know scientific methods. In our case study, students' learning progress, motivation, and enjoyment of learning were measured. The results indicate that teaching at an out-of-school learning site as well as working with hands-on materials not only has a motivational effect but also increases enjoyment of learning. Furthermore, neglected ecosystems like vineyards serve as new and fitting examples for teaching ecological and plant-biological topics. The results indicate a significant learning gain for the participants. Thus, biology curricula should be broadened to include more and local plants and ecosystems.

AB The purpose of this activity is to model the formation of homologous chromosomes and the crossing over realized in meiosis I cell division. The model established through the activities conducted will allow students to visualize homologous chromosomes and the formation of crossing over among them. The model will help students to understand how homologous chromosomes occur and how crossing over is realized between homologous chromosomes whose chromatids are not sisters. The developed model is found to be an effective tool in teaching crossing over.

ID COLLEGE-STUDENTS
AB Many undergraduates who wish to pursue degrees in science, particularly students from underrepresented groups, drop out of science majors before realizing their goal. This study examines the effectiveness of a mentoring program - called Biomentors - aimed at promoting success in biology courses for undergraduates beginning their coursework toward a bachelor's degree in the biological sciences. Students enrolled in the Biomentors program met twice a week in a small group with an advanced biology major under the supervision of a faculty member to explore effective learning strategies for success in an introductory-level biology course they were taking. Students who participated in the Biomentors program scored significantly higher (based on total points earned) than other students enrolled in the course across two cohorts (d = 0.36 in the fall quarter of 2014; d = 0.34 in the winter quarter of 2015). The biomentors group significantly outscored the control group even when the effects of gender, parent income level, parent education level, total SAT score, and cumulative GPA were statistically controlled using a stepwise regression. Overall, the results encourage further investigation of the effectiveness of peer-mentoring programs that emphasize domain-specific learning strategies for college students beginning as science majors.

AB Teachers are charged with increasing students' scientific literacy, which involves interpreting evidence and making sense of patterns. However, teachers need access to - or must be able to generate - authentic datasets if they are to help their students develop quantitative reasoning skills. We describe an evolutionary ecology lesson focused on resource competition in a parasitic wasp. Students use datasets to generate graphs and test hypotheses on resource competition and fitness.

AB In our first-year university botany classes at Charles Sturt University, we noticed that in laboratory class, students were taking photographs of their specimens with the dissecting and compound microscopes using their mobile phones. Student-generated images as "learning objects" were used to enhance the engagement of all students, including Distance Education students who used images provided by the on-campus students. The Distance Education students did all the laboratory work at an intensive residential school, and they were encouraged to take images; these were shared with on-campus students, making them aware of the laboratory practical work they were yet to do. In other cases, images from students were incorporated into lectures and tutorials, preparing students for the lab exam. Botany students have shared their photomicrographs with their friends and family via social media. We saw interesting examples of students excitedly describing their images to non-science friends, teaching them what they were learning! In the second year, students were also encouraged to use their phones to capture their own images of plant specimens to help them master plant identification. Although we do not have any quantitative evidence of these activities enhancing student learning, it was evident that those students who took and shared their own images were more engaged in the learning process.

ID GUT MICROBIOTA; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; OBESE
AB Until about two decades ago, the standard method of studying a microbe was to isolate it, grow it in culture, stain it, and examine it under a microscope. Today, new genomic tools are helping expand our view of the microbial world. Instead of viewing them as "germs" to be eliminated, we are beginning to perceive our microbes as an extension of ourselves - an important organ with unique functions essential to our well-being. Scientists even came up with a new term, "microbiome," to define our microbes' genes as an important counterpart to our human genome. With new information about the human microbiome comes the challenge of shifting biology students' focus from casting microbes as pathogens toward appreciating microbes as symbionts. "The Human Microbiome," a curriculum supplement produced by the Genetic Science Learning Center, emphasizes that microbes living in and on our bodies perform neutral and beneficial functions, that human microbiota form thriving ecosystems, and that disruptions to our microbial ecosystems may have consequences. In this article, we describe the curriculum materials, provide strategies for incorporating this cutting-edge topic into biology classrooms, list connections to the Next Generation Science Standards, and report on recent research testing the curriculum supplement's effectiveness for student learning.

AB Learning about stem cells within the context of treating pet illness or injury is an additional way for teachers to discuss the integration of science, technology, and veterinary medicine. We explain how practitioners in veterinary medicine harvest animal stem cells from adipose (fat) tissue in treating pet illness or injury. Further, we narrate how the veterinarian's approach to pet stem cell therapy demonstrates an important step in technological progress in science, one that may lead to medical advances for humans.

TI Using a Phototransduction System to Monitor the Isolated Frog Heart
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Transducer; light; Wheatstone bridge; frog heart; dose-response
AB A simple and inexpensive method of monitoring the movement of an isolated frog heart provides comparable results to those obtained with a force transducer. A commercially available photoresistor is integrated into a Wheatstone bridge circuit, and the output signal is interfaced directly with a recording device. An excised, beating frog heart is placed in a Petri dish and over the photoresistor so that movements produced during the heartbeat cycle change the amount of light entering the photoresistor and, therefore, the voltage output from the circuit. Experiments that can be done with this system include the effects of temperature and dose-response relationships with Ringer's solutions containing acetylcholine and norepinephrine.

   an Inquiry-Based Water Quality Curriculum for 8th Graders
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE NGSS; microbiology; chemistry; water quality; inquiry
AB For many middle school students, connections between their lives and concepts like chemical reactivity, microbial contamination, and experimental sampling are not obvious. They may also feel that, even if there were connections, understanding the monitoring and quality of natural resources is something for grownups and beyond their responsibility. This curriculum highlights connections. Students characterize bacteria in a local untreated water source and investigate the mechanism, effectiveness, and byproducts of chlorine bleach as a water treatment. Working in groups, they use different growth and treatment conditions to characterize samples, thus collectively obtaining a more complete description of the system. The North Carolina 8th Grade Standard Course of Study Objectives were used during curricular development, and alignment to Next Generation Science Standards performance expectations is provided. Teacher-guided discussions, demonstrations, experimentation, and database investigation engage students as they develop informed and critical opinions about water quality and water treatment methods. The final activity connects scientific investigation to advocacy and civic engagement.

AB For many students, preconceived notions about Darwin are among the most significant obstacles in learning about the theory of evolution by natural selection. I present an activity designed to eliminate this obstacle and encourage empathizing with Darwin, utilizing the history-of-science approach. Through the activity, students' negative thoughts about Darwin disappeared, Darwin's position as a scientist came to the fore, students' interest in evolution increased, and they started to discuss the theory within a scientific framework.

We offer a set of activities, implemented successfully at both the secondary and postsecondary levels, that involve students in guided inquiry toward creation and progressive revision of a robust model of selection that accounts for both natural and sexual selection and their complicated relationship to one another at the level of individuals and populations. Requiring students to progressively revise their models in light of data and previous understanding replicates scientific practice and allows for authentic assessment of students' growing content knowledge, understanding, and skills regarding scientific modeling and communication processes.

AB Although the development of next-generation (NextGen) sequencing technologies has revolutionized genomic research and medicine, the incorporation of these topics into the classroom is challenging, given an implied high degree of technical complexity. We developed an easy-to-implement, interactive classroom activity investigating the similarities and differences between current sequencing methodology and three NextGen technologies. The activity uses existing materials created by each of the biotechnology companies that outline their instrumentation and chemistries. Following this activity, students will understand the molecular biology behind these NextGen applications and the similarities to existing Sanger sequencing methods.

I discuss the many roles that G-protein-coupled receptors play in vertebrate physiology and how one particular point mutation can have enormous evolutionary consequences.

AB Biological and social evolutionary processes, along with social and cultural developments, have allowed humans to separate procreation from pleasurable/recreational sexual activity. As a class learning project, an alternative, hypothetical reproductive scenario is presented: "What if humans were biologically ready to conceive only during one period each year?" Discussion is followed by small-group or individual research on the possible effects of this scenario on human reproductive response and its further effects on human life, society, and civilization. An important purpose of the activity is to stimulate active learning through small-group interaction, communication, and research.

ID METAMORPHOSIS
AB Tribolium castanaeum is a widespread insect in temperate regions. Because of its short generation time and easy handling, it serves as a model organism for various scientific questions. However, T. castanaeum, or its larger-sized relative Tenebrio molitor, can also be used at a school or college level to foster students' experimentation skills. We present a set of inquiry tasks that build stepwise on one another, using T. castanaeum or T. molitor as the model. The students will learn not only about insect ecology, but also about the influence of nutrition on several fitness parameters, such as development time and offspring number.

DE Evolution; phylogenetics; tree thinking; estimating species divergence

AB Misinformation, preconceptions, and the human perception of time (e. g., in seconds, minutes, days, and years) are factors that can contribute to difficulties experienced by students trying to understand evolutionary phenomena on the scale of geological or "deep" time. In addition to other approaches, the use of a simple online species-divergence estimate calculator, "TimeTree: The Timescale of Life," can add resolution and clarity to big ideas that sometimes stand in the way of students' understanding of the unifying theory in biology, evolution.

DE Simple computer program; conifer genera identification
AB The National Science Education Standards prescribe that an understanding of the importance of classifying organisms be one component of a student's educational experience in the life sciences. The use of a classification scheme to identify organisms is one way of addressing this goal. We describe Conifer ID, a computer application that assists students in the identification of conifers without requiring prior specific knowledge. Conifer ID promotes careful observational skills and presents students with visual aids during the identification to overcome some of the weaknesses of more traditional identification methods.

TI Stability & Change in a Freshwater Ecosystem: A Blooming Mess
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Investigation; ecosystem; zooplankton; phytoplankton; anthropogenic;
   algal bloom.
AB A report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found 46% of rivers and streams and 21% of lakes are in poor biological condition (EPA, 2017). In this 5E standards-based inquiry lesson, students actively engage with the natural phenomena of algal blooms through the introduction of the harmful algal bloom (HAB) that occurred in Lake Erie's western basin in the summer of 2011. Students make sense of relationships within aquatic ecosystems, using microcosms (miniature ecosystems) containing phytoplankton and zooplankton, and then communicate their findings through a scientific manuscript. This lesson engages students in the three-dimensional learning identified in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) under the standard of HSLS2, Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics. More specifically, students address the expectation of HS-LS2-6 when they make sense of how the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, while changing conditions may result in new ecosystems. This long-term scientific investigation also provides students with opportunities to make sense of aspects of the nature of science, while increasing their science content knowledge and understanding of the practices of science. Evaluation of student work occurs at all stages of the lesson.

AB The biological sciences are becoming increasingly reliant on computer science and associated technologies to quickly and efficiently analyze and interpret complex data sets. Introducing students to data analysis techniques is a critical part of their development as well-rounded, scientifically literate citizens. As part of a collaborative effort between the Biology and Computer Science departments at William Er Mary, we sought to develop laboratory exercises that would introduce basic ideas of data analysis while also exposing students to Python, a commonly used computer programming language. We accomplished this by developing exercises within the interactive Jupyter Notebook platform, an open-source application that allows Python code to be written and executed as discrete blocks in real time. Students used the developed Jupyter Notebook to analyze data collected as part of a multiweek ecology field experiment aimed at determining the effect of white-tailed deer on aspects of biological diversity. These inquiry-based laboratory exercises generated scientifically relevant data and gave students a chance to experience and participate in ongoing scientific research while demonstrating the utility of computer science in the scientific process.

TI Slime Mold Quarantine: An Engineering-Design-Integrated Biology Unit
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Engineering design; slime mold; high school; integration
AB Students often find it challenging to learn about complex and abstract biological processes. Using the engineering design process, which involves designing, building, and testing prototypes, can help students visualize the processes and anchor ideas from lab activities. We describe an engineering-design-integrated biology unit designed for high school students in which they learn about the properties of slime molds, the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and the iterative nature of the engineering design process. Using the engineering design process, students were successful in quarantining the slime mold from the non-inoculated oats. A t-test revealed statistically significant differences in students' understanding of slime mold characteristics, the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and the engineering design process before and after the unit. Overall, students demonstrated sound understanding of the biology core ideas and engineering design skills inherent in this unit.

AB One of the most perplexing dilemmas in modern science is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Even though the illness was recognized at the beginning of the 20th century, the pathogenicity and etiology of the disease remain unknown. We describe an open-inquiry case study on CFS that we have used in our biology classrooms to increase students' critical-thinking skills and understanding of scientific method. Three general categories of potential pathogens - virus, vaccine, and microbiome - are discussed during multiple classroom sessions. We found that our students were more proactive than expected They researched credible references from the most recent publications and formulated arguments on the medical issue. They applied knowledge of human body systems to explain the complexity of the disease. Students were capable of distinguishing "correlation" and "cause" relations between the disease and pathogens. We observed a high level of student participation and involvement, which not only increased their knowledge of scientific approaches but also strengthened their interaction and communication skills. The case study is suitable for biology courses in both high school and college.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE Evo-devo; evolutionary developmental biology; enhancers
ID EVOLUTION
AB Evolution is a central principle of biology. However, key aspects of evolution can be very difficult to model in a classroom setting. Two such key principles are (1) how the accumulation of small, relatively minor modifications can lead to the diversity of life over extended periods of time; and (2) how closely related genomes between different organisms can yield such dramatic differences in patterning and phenotype. The second aspect is explained largely by evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo"), whereby tiny modifications in when, where, and how much the same genes are used during development can lead to dramatic differences in the adult. Developmental construction, using similar building tools, can lead to the formation of a large variety of forms. Here, I describe fun, inexpensive, and simple methods using drawings and Legos by which students can actively generate understanding of descent by modification and evo-devo. Specifically, students learn how the same genes, used in different ways, can lead to "endless forms most beautiful" as originally phrased by Darwin himself. With the accompanying guided discussion, these activities also illustrate other key principles of evo-devo such as combinatorial and modular enhancers, Von Baer's principles, and genetic and morphological homology.

AB Understanding the theory of natural selection is crucial for any student of biology, but many secondary and postsecondary students struggle with the concepts. We present a novel, engaging exercise to illustrate natural selection through making pancakes. After students make pancakes (representing offspring) with various ingredients (illustrating genetic diversity and allelic variation), other students (representing the environment) judge the pancakes on the basis of taste. Only the highest-ranking pancakes are made in a second generation (illustrating population change over time), and new ingredients are added. After several generations of pancakes, with each generation exposed to ever-changing "environments," students understand the fundamental concepts associated with the theory of natural selection.

AB "Plant blindness" is defined as the failure to appreciate the fundamental importance of plants. To address this phenomenon, we created the Pet Plant Project (P-3) where students grow an unknown plant from seed, monitor development, and relate lecture concepts to their plant on a daily basis. A qualitative survey was administered and analyzed to evaluate student responses to the experience. Themes in the analysis, identified across 209 studentparticipants at Tennessee Tech University, included positive reinforcement of lecture material, a new-found appreciation for plants, responsibility and pride related to plant care, a continued desire to grow plants, and more. Statistical results included: 73% of students noticed plants more after the project; 76% planned to grow plants in the future; and 68% made a connection with their own plant that bolstered engagement in course materials.

AB Evolutionary trees are powerful tools used in modern biological research, and commonly used in textbooks and classroom instruction. Studies have shown that K-14 students have difficulties interpreting evolutionary trees. To improve student learning about this topic, it is essential to teach them how to understand and use trees like professional biologists. Unfortunately, few currently used teaching frameworks for evolution instruction are designed for this purpose. In this study we developed the Model of the Use of Evolutionary Trees (MUET), a conceptual model that characterizes how evolutionary trees were used by professional biologists as represented in their research publications. The development of the MUET was guided by the Concept-Reasoning Mode of representation (CRM) model as well as a "model of modeling" framework. The MUET was then used to review instructional and assessment material for K-14 classrooms. Future studies with the MUET may inform the development of teaching materials for K-14 classrooms aimed at improving students' understanding of and learning about evolutionary trees.

AB Insects have extraordinary species richness: over a million species have been identified, and even more await discovery and classification. Given their abundance and diversity, insects are excellent teaching tools for science classrooms. However, accurate insect identification can be especially challenging for beginning students. Accordingly, we have developed a dichotomous key that both precollege and university instructors and students can use efficiently to correctly identify 18 taxonomic orders of insects. Our key was developed to target insects most commonly encountered throughout the coastal southeastern United States, but it can easily be adapted to other regions. This key is novel in that it incorporates not only adult insects but also their immature stages. In addition, we included insects that are likely to be collected in all seasons, facilitating implementation in the classroom throughout the academic year.

Here, I present a laboratory course in cell and molecular biology that is designed to mimic a true research project. Students work through a 10-step experimental design culminating in the construction, expression, and visualization of microtubules fused to green fluorescent protein in baker's yeast. The steps of this project include the isolation of the tubulin gene from yeast genomic DNA, the cloning of that gene into an expression vector, the amplification of this plasmid in E. coli, and the expression of fluorescent tubulin in yeast. Controls and validation steps are embedded throughout the project, as they would be in a genuine research project. This laboratory course more closely resembles a one-semester undergraduate research experience than a typical lab course. However, because this course reaches a much larger number of students compared with undergraduate research opportunities, it provides students with a valuable research experience that remains confined to the scheduled time block of a typical lab course. In this way, many of the benefits of research are experienced by a large number of undergraduates.

AB This bioacoustics activity combines concepts in invertebrate taxonomy, animal communication, and acoustical physics while providing a unique opportunity for physics and biology teachers to collaborate and introduce their students to an exciting, interdisciplinary research field. Here, we propose a lab- and field-based activity that uses hydrophones to explore how shrimp snapping behavior changes in response to different stimuli and introduces students to the process of scientific inquiry. Using free software, students use spectrograms to visualize and analyze their experimental data. Furthermore, we propose potential modifications to the lab for classrooms without easy access to marine environments or snapping shrimp.

TI A Hair & a Fungus: Showing Kids the Size of a Microbe
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Microbes; microorganism; fungus; fungi; hypha; hyphae; mold; microscopy
AB A simple method is presented to show kids the size of a microbe - a fungus hypha - compared to a human hair. Common household items are used to make sterile medium on a stove or hotplate, which is dispensed in the cells of a weekly plastic pill box. Mold fungi can be easily and safely grown on the medium from the classroom environment. A microscope capable of 200-400x is necessary. Students can use a hair from their own head to view a fungus and a hair side-byside on the same slide. They will see that a microscopic fungus hypha is 20-50x smaller in diameter than a hair. Older students will also learn that microbes are measured in micrometers, that fungi are ubiquitous, and that decay is an inevitable part of Earth's processes.

AB Proteomics is an emerging area of systems biology that allows simultaneous study of thousands of proteins expressed in cells, tissues, or whole organisms. We have developed this activity to enable high school or college students to explore proteomic databases using mass spectrometry data files generated from yeast proteins in a college laboratory course. Students upload files of "unknown" proteins from our public website, enter them into a proteomics search engine (Mascot), identify the proteins, and use additional proteomics websites to learn about their functions and three-dimensional structures. This activity is suitable for use in units exploring protein structure and function, metabolism, or bioinformatics.

AB Students observe a tree bud from late winter until it sprouts. They learn to use dichotomous keys to identify their tree. The activity is inquiry-based; students predict when their bud will open and what it will become. Student drawings, quotes, and data are included to exemplify the process. The activity can be used to teach plant vocabulary and differentiation as well. It can be adapted to any grade level - from elementary school to college.

AB There are endless numbers of investigations that a student can be exposed to in the science classroom. Regardless of the investigation, students may sometimes be asked to construct a scientific explanation of a phenomenon or research question. One style students may use to write their response integrates the claim, evidence, and reasoning framework. As students learn to write in this style, it is important that they are provided with supports such as organizers. While many organizers exist, there are some additions that can be made to improve on the student's experience. This article shares an example of a CER organizer that others can use and modify in their own classrooms. Rationale for its design is also provided.

AB Many of today's adolescents have little to no connection to their environments or the native plants and animals that share their spaces. This is primarily due to a significant decrease in the amount of time children spend outdoors now, compared with children in the mid to late 20th century, compounded by a lack of natural history and outdoor experiences in schools. Nature journaling is an effective way for life science teachers to get adolescents outside and incorporate nature studies into their lessons. Students engaged in regular, -sustained nature journaling could experience an increase in literacy and critical thinking skills, an increase in understanding and connections to their native landscapes, and a decline in anxiety and depression.

AB How to eat healthily is a question that has received much attention. It is important to find an easy way to help students figure out answers. Here we used a meta-analysis-based life expectancy calculator from recent research to let students self-test and to educate students about the impact of food choices and how to make good diet decisions. This activity can also let students experience the advancing role of big data meta-analysis in nutrition research and real life. In addition, it allows students to discuss the complexity of scientific research and its limitations.

DE biological race; racism; antiracism; human evolution; pseudo-science;
   social construct
AB The damaging outcomes of racist ideologies continue to influence all aspects of society. This in spite of the fact that at their core these ideologies rely on a fundamentally false assumption: that biologically there are different races among humans. The source of this fallacy is pseudoscience and historical prejudice, and yet even scientists and medical professionals continue to apply misconceptions about biological race when performing research or practicing medicine. Scientific educators are in a unique position to dismantle the central damaging assumption, and here we provide a straightforward approach that educators can employ for engaging in this conversation. It is organized around four questions that build sequentially and integrate the latest science with a history of the topic: How did the myth of biological subcategories of humans become ingrained as a scientific concept? How has scientists' approach to taxonomy changed since Linnaeus's first human classifications? What does biology now tell us about variation within the human species? Why is it critical to debunk this myth? We provide answers with which scientific educators can re-center the conversation around historical and scientific facts, while highlighting how misapplication of the evidence harms the integrity of science as a field.

AB This article discusses a variety of open resources that can be used to teach mycology. Many schools may not routinely teach a mycology class - and if they do, students might not want to invest in a textbook. Options for resale are probably much smaller than with a class in which more students routinely enroll. This article is important in showing both students and faculty how much information about fungi is available online. Some websites are transient, so the reader must carefully check them before use. The sites selected cover most topics that are typically covered in a mycology class. However, depending on faculty emphasis, not all of the information presented in the article may be relevant. These resources should enable faculty to achieve the major teaching objectives in a mycology class, enabling students to gain an appreciation of the diversity of fungi and a basic understanding of their biology, ecology, genetics, morphology, and taxonomy.

TI Testing Mosquitoes for Student Inquiry: Husbandry Lessons in the Lab
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE mosquito; blood feeding; behavior; beautyberry; repellent
AB Because mosquitoes are a public health concern, several chemical insect repellents have been created and used for many years. While some of these products, such as DEET and permethrin, are effective at controlling mosquito populations, their excessive use may lead to animal, human, and environmental harm if applied improperly. Understanding the life cycles of mosquitoes, their feeding preferences, and their responses to natural plant extracts could enable scientists to develop more environmentally safe but still effective insect repellents. Various types of plant extracts (e.g., American beautyberry, Callicarpa americana) hold promise. In order to study such plant-mosquito interactions, we had to establish basic husbandry practices for successfully rearing and maintaining mosquito populations in the lab. We discuss the protocols we have used for housing mosquitoes and creating plant extracts and offer suggestions for how students can use both for inquiry.

AB Problem-based learning via virtual exchange affords opportunities for students to learn biology while developing abilities to learn about and work with diverse others. We describe an activity using these methods, with goals for students to develop useful cell structure analogies, analyze how analogies are not perfect representations of target concepts, practice working with diverse others, deepen cell structure knowledge, and learn about people from another culture. We explain the framework for the activity and share student evaluation data. The activity had U.S. and Egyptian high school girls compare their Phoenix and Cairo homes, create an imagined combined home, construct an analogy for how cell structures and organelles are like parts of this home, and then analyze their analogy to see where it breaks down. The activity does not require special materials, only internet access through a computer or mobile phone and access to Google Dots. Students used critical and creative thinking, first to construct their analogies and then to analyze those analogies. Evaluation data suggest that students learned from the activity, enjoyed it, and appreciated the opportunity to work with someone from a different culture.

AB Current trends in education include offering students authentic experiences that generate broad interest, develop their cognitive flexibility, and prepare them to be scientifically literate members of society. We present a three-part guided-inquiry lab that gives students practice applying the scientific method to control fruit fly outbreaks and reinforces concepts related to behavioral and sensory biology. This activity was designed and tested at a four-year university but can be modified for high school courses. Students are "employed" by the fictional Fruit Fly Trap Company to design a device to maximize capture of female fruit flies using environmentally friendly lures. During this lab, students collaborate to conduct literature searches, ask research questions, develop hypotheses, design experiments, collect and analyze data, and present findings in a short oral presentation. In our implementation of this module in a biology class for nonmajors in fall 2017, over 50% of students reported that the literature research, scent experiments, trap construction, trap testing, and PowerPoint presentation were extremely effective in teaching science process and biological problem-solving skills. Over 70% of our students rated the practical, hands-on elements of the activity as enjoyable. Overall, students generally enjoyed the lab and reported positive impacts on their learning.

AB Centuries of practice clearly demonstrate that immunization by means of vaccination reduces the disease burden in human and nonhuman animal species. While the emphasis on individual health and fitness is important, the role of immunization in maintaining the health of entire populations or communities is also important. I developed a simulation that allows participants to actively explore the value of herd immunity in controlling the spread of infectious disease, first by considering how quickly an entire population may become ill if no one has immunity, and then after immunization of 80% of the population. Pretest, posttest, and four-week follow-up questionnaire data collected from nonmajor introductory biology students surest that active engagement in an activity such as the one described may contribute to longer-term retention of the principles and concepts than presentation by lecture alone.

AB Terrestrial isopods (often referred to as sow bugs or pill bugs) are small, land-dwelling crustaceans. Because of their gentle nature, terrestrial isopods are excellent animals to have in a science classroom. There are many fun and effective classroom activities that utilize terrestrial isopods to teach science concepts, but there are multiple barriers to acquiring the large number of terrestrial isopods needed for classroom activities. Furthermore, when terrestrial isopods are brought into the classroom, the possibility exists that they will die inhumanely because finding good information on their proper care and reproduction can be difficult. Websites, books, and magazines frequently provide contradictory, inaccurate, incomplete, overly complex, and inhumane care information. To address these issues, this article explains how to set up a simple, low-maintenance, and inexpensive classroom enclosure for the terrestrial isopod species Porcellio scaber. These techniques, which I use in my classroom, produce large numbers of healthy captive-bred P. scaber. This article also presents examples of effective, hands-on classroom activities utilizing P. scaber.

DT Article
DE Koch's postulates; selective media; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
AB Koch's postulates are regularly included in the lecture portion of microbiology courses, but rarely are they demonstrated in a microbiology teaching lab. This is understandable given the logistical challenges of undergraduates working with pathogenic bacteria, ethical concerns using animals, and limited time constraints of a weekly lab period. Here we present a cost-effective, time-friendly lab activity that demonstrates the principles of microbial isolation and infection assays that are part of fulfilling Koch's postulates. The disease is "peep pox" caused by a gelatinase-positive bacterial species hydrolyzing marshmallow peeps that proxy as infected animals.

ID FOOD-WEB
AB Biomagnification influences the movement of environmental contaminants and relates to food chains and the transfer of matter in ecosystems, concepts that are found in the Next Generation Science Standards. Consequently, we developed a hands-on, discussion-based activity for the middle school science classroom to demonstrate biomagnification and connect it to food webs and trophic pyramids. Each student represents an aquatic organism, and together students simulate the consumption and excretion processes in an aquatic food chain. This simulation demonstrates how certain environmental contaminants accumulate within organisms and ultimately become concentrated in predators at the top of the food chain.

ID ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES
AB Symbiosis is a fascinating and diverse phenomenon. The study of symbiosis is important to understanding ecology, as it helps us understand relationships between organisms and provides insight into co-evolution, mutualism, adaptation, and survival. Ecological studies are challenging to implement in K-12 classrooms because they often require multiple organisms (often very different in size) and complex environments that are difficult to replicate accurately (e.g., soil composition, temperature, pH, and humidity). These factors can make it difficult to study quantitative changes in ecosystems. We developed an inexpensive, quantitative experiment for classrooms that can be used to explore important aspects of microbial symbiosis, pathogenesis, and ecology, and that helps support more investigations in this area of education. The experiment is low-cost, designed for K-12 teachers and students, uses common materials, and teaches students about the exciting relationships among bacteria, worms, and insects.

AB The value of long-term data (generally >10 years) in ecology is well known. Funding agencies clearly see the value in these data and have supported a limited number of projects to this end. However, individual researchers often see the challenges of long-term data collection as insurmountable. We propose that long-term data collection can be practical as part of any teaching or outreach program, and we provide guidance on how long-term projects can fit into a teaching and research schedule. While our primary audience is college faculty, our message is appropriate for anyone interested in establishing long-term studies. The benefits of adopting these kinds of projects include experience for students, encouraging public interest in science, increased publication potential for researchers, and increased large-scale data availability, leading to a better understanding of ecological phenomena.

AB This article discusses the alluring topic of olfactory learning, which is often touched on in the literature but is rarely employed. I argue that olfactory learning, at its best, is achieved in contact with living nature, as in the plethora of scents that can be encountered and discussed in ecological context in a forest. An expected outcome is enhanced sensory awareness of the living environment.

TI Using Models to Support Argumentation in the Science Classroom
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Modeling; argumentation; dialogic teaching; pedagogy; human body system
ID STUDENTS DEVELOPMENT; INQUIRY
AB Scientists use models to represent their imagination and conceptualization of a particular phenomenon. They then use models to develop an argument to debate, defend, and debunk ideas in their peer community. Modeling is an essential practice of authentic science. To foster the pedagogical practice of incorporating models in argumentative contexts, we introduce an approach called "Science Negotiation Pedagogy." We show how models can support argumentation practices in science classrooms in six phases of action: (1) create a driving question; (2) construct a tentative model in groups; (3) construct a tentative argument in groups; (4) negotiate models and arguments in a whole-class discussion, then revise models and arguments through negotiation; (5) consult the experts; and (6) reflect through writing. A unit on the human respiratory system is used as an example to demonstrate how Science Negotiation Pedagogy can be implemented in biology classrooms.

AB The historic debate of nature vs. nurture has emerged as a central yin-yang of contemporary health and disease research. The Human Genome Project provided the capability to define the nature of an individual by one's genetic sequence. But tools are not available to sequence lifelong exposures (i.e., the nurture of an individual). Many believe that nurture has an even greater role than genetics in determining lifelong success, health, and well-being. In contemporary terminology, the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the life span is termed the exposome. This includes all external exposures from the environment, diet, behavior, societal influences and infections, and also cumulative biological responses to exposures and endogenous processes. Pursuit of a "Human Exposome Project" is a vision worthy of our youth: development of strategies and tools will require the brightest and most imaginative. Incorporation of the exposome into education curricula will foster discussion, development of interest, improvement of skills, and promotion of critical thinking to prepare students for civically engaged lives, ongoing study, and future career opportunities. The long-term vision is that sequencing the exposome will support better understanding of healthful and harmful lifelong exposures and lead to improved opportunity for the health and prosperity of all.

TI "Finding Garrett": An Evolutionary Language Development Game
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE Evolution; language development; natural selection; evolutionary biology
ID CONVERGENT EVOLUTION; BIRD; SONG
AB Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that leads to adaptations in species or populations. Phenotypes confer habitat-specific fitness consequences, which could lead to the evolution of similar strategies (convergence) or different strategies (divergence) within and across species. The evolution of communication is an example of convergent evolution in many cases. We describe a learning game that simulates the emergence of language and highlights differences between convergent and divergent evolution. With minor modifications, this game can also be used to illustrate phenotypic plasticity. During three preliminary trials, high school and university students representing different species developed novel strategies (languages) to solve the common problem of finding "Garrett," a student who mimicked an essential resource. Naturally, there was a range of complexity and diversity among the strategies that emerged. We describe how the game can help illustrate evolutionary principles such as adaptation and natural selection.

The aim is to help improve students' spatial thinking and their understanding of how spatial statistic equations work. Students use simulated data to develop their own statistic and apply that equation to experimental behavioral data for Gambusia affinis (western mosquitofish). This activity can be adapted and conducted at the 9-16 grade levels.

However, many students still think of microbes only as germs that harm us. The classroom activities presented here are designed to shift student thinking on this topic. In these guided inquiry activities, students investigate human-microbe interactions as they work together to interpret and analyze authentic data from published articles and develop scientific models. Through the activities, students learn and apply ecological concepts as they come to see the human body as a fascinatingly complex ecosystem.

ID UNDERSTANDINGS; SCHOOL; DIFFICULTIES; INHERITANCE
AB Various sequences for teaching genetics have been proposed. Three seventh-grade biology textbooks in Taiwan share similar key knowledge assemblages but have different knowledge arrangements. To investigate the influence of knowledge arrangements on student understanding of genetics, we compared students' reading comprehension of the three texts that exhibit different knowledge arrangements. The results revealed that one particular knowledge arrangement (genetic materials, mitotic and meiotic models, genetic model, and molecular model) leads to the greatest reading comprehension of genetics. The differences are found in knowledge of mitotic and meiotic models. The results of this study are valuable for use in organizing instruction.

AB Evolutionary theory is the foundation of the biological sciences, yet conveying it to General Biology students often presents a challenge, especially at larger institutions where student numbers in foundation courses can exceed several hundred per lecture section. We present a pedagogically sound exercise that utilizes a series of simple and inexpensive simulations to convey the concept of evolution through mutation and natural selection. Questions after each simulation expand student comprehension; a class discussion encourages advanced thinking on mutation and speciation. A final paper requires students to synthesize their learning by summarizing selected papers on these topics. A grading rubric for the papers is included.

AB We designed a microbiology project that fully engaged undergraduate biology students, high school students, and their teachers in a summer research program as part of the Research Education Vitalizing Science University Program conducted at California State University Bakersfield. Modern molecular biological methods and microscopy were used to detect and identify microcrustacean species in ponds around Bakersfield, California, that harbor the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The students learned about the amphibian decline in California and worldwide due to chytridiomycosis and how microcrustaceans as natural predators of Bd-zoospores can be used in mitigation strategies for amphibian conservation.

AB Our nation's first school of forestry operated in the early 1900s, when states were still being admitted to the union, and the motor car and typewriter had just been introduced to the American public. In the previous century, timber operations had slashed their way through forests with the simple policy of "cut and get out." To farmers, trees were obstacles to plows. The popular writings of Aldo Leopold describing the concepts of forest stewardship and the organization of natural communities would not appear for another four decades.

AB Teachers may be posed with such questions as, "If we evolved from chimps, why are there still chimps?" We provide teachers with answers to this and related questions in the context of the latest genetic, fossil, and behavioral evidence. We also provide references they can use to further students' understanding of human evolution and evolution in general. In the process, we highlight recent discoveries in paleontology, molecular evolution, and comparative genomics. Modern chimps and humans shared a now extinct common ancestor that was neither a chimp nor a human - in other words, humans did not evolve from chimps - and, though chimps are humans' closest living relatives, we are characterized by distinct evolutionary histories.

DE Invertebrate; evolution; biodiversity; laboratory
AB In many survey classes, such as general biology, marine biology, or life sciences, covering the major invertebrate phyla can become a time sink. I have developed a laboratory exercise in which students examine the Porifera (sponges), Cnidaria (jellyfish, etc.), Annelida (worms), Mollusca (snails, clams, etc.), Arthropoda (insects, crabs, etc.), Brachiopoda (lamp shells), Echinodermata (brittle stars, urchins, etc.), and Chordata (tunicates) in one session. This multistation laboratory uses a combination of preserved and live specimens, slides, and images to present samples of each phylum. The exercise is designed to take advantage of an aquarium in the classroom but does not require one. Students answer questions and sketch what they observe at one or two stations per phylum. The lab takes approximately 2 hours with a 20-minute setup, and students are able to see the vast diversity among these phyla and understand the similarities and differences across the groups. I have found this laboratory to be effective in teaching the invertebrate phyla in a course when time is a limiting factor.

AB Four inquiry-based laboratories are described that introduce students to the properties of human brain cells. These experiments require no technical equipment, are inexpensive and safe, and introduce students to genuine research using neuropsychological investigations as a means of studying the properties of brain cells. Students design and conduct an experiment using optical illusions to explore the activity and response of specific nerve cells of the visual system. Some of the successes and pitfalls of such an activity are discussed.

TI Making the Most of the <i>Daphnia</i> Heart Rate Lab: Optimizing the Use
   of Ethanol, Nicotine & Caffeine
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Heart; caffeine; nicotine; ethanol; Daphnia
AB Students commonly test the effects of chemical agents on the heart rate of the crustacean Daphnia magna, but the procedure has never been optimized. We determined the effects of three concentrations of ethanol, nicotine, and caffeine and of a control solution on heart rate in Daphnia. Ethanol at 5% and 10% (v/v) reduced mean heart rate to similar to 50% and similar to 20% of its initial value, respectively. Recovery was rapid after removing 5% ethanol, but recovery from 10% ethanol took 20-30 minutes. Nicotine at 100 mu M reversibly increased mean heart rate by similar to 20%. Higher concentrations produced varied and sometimes irreversible effects. Caffeine at 0.1%, 0.5%, and 2% (w/v) had no convincing effect on heart rate. Of the three agents tested, nicotine's peculiar effects make it the least useful in an educational setting. Caffeine could be used to emphasize the need for blind observers because it does not increase heart rate in Daphnia. If students find that it does, their bias is revealed. Ethanol produces unambiguous effects at 5% and 10%. Heart rates recover quickly after removing 5% ethanol, which allows students to explore reversibility as an alternative to having a separate control group.

AB Evolutionary medicine is a growing area of research and practice; however, it is not widely discussed in introductory biology courses. Because of the interest in human biology, using evolutionary medicine is a great way to hold students' interest, placing topics in context, making the subject of evolution relevant. Too often students lose interest in learning about evolution because they think it is not pertinent. The pedagogical technique of using case studies in the classroom engages students in a way that will grow their understanding of topics, in this case evolution, as well as helping students with critical thinking and process skills, growing their scientific literacy.
   The following case study is appropriate for an introductory biology course that focuses on evolution, an AP biology course, or an introductory evolution course for undergraduates. The case focuses on the evolutionary perspectives of what might be causing human ear infections, as well as the role of beneficial species of gut bacteria in maintaining a healthy immune system. It is advantageous for students to know about natural selection and coevolution before using the case study.

AB Biological terms describing abnormal numbers of chromosomes, such as polyploidy, eupolyploidy, aneuploidy, autopolyploidy, and allopolyploidy, can be confusing to students. A card-sorting activity designed to expose high school students to these key terms used in the evolution and genetics units of biology classes allows them to visualize these concepts. Students work with classmates to organize key terms with matching definitions and diagrams. The activity will solidify students' knowledge and understanding about different chromosomal abnormalities that can result from nondisjunction occurring in meiosis or from mating with different species, which may lead to sympatric speciation.

AB Students often struggle with visualizing protein structures when working with two-dimensional textbook and lecture materials, so introducing them to 3D visualization software developed by and for structural biologists offers them a unique opportunity to work with authentic data while furthering their spatial reasoning skills and understanding of molecular structure and function. This article presents an active learning virtual laboratory in which students use authentic structural biology data to investigate the effects of both hypothetical and real-world SARS-CoV-2 mutations on the virus's ability to bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect a host, causing COVID-19. Through this activity, introductory-level college students or advanced high school students gain a better understanding of applied biology, such as how vaccines and treatments are designed, as well as strengthening their understanding of core disciplinary concepts, such as the relationship between protein structure and function and the central dogma of molecular biology. While there were challenges during the pilot phase of activity development due to COVID-19 restrictions, students in the pilot groups came away from the activity with deeper understanding of the relationship between proteins and amino acid sequences and a new appreciation for the ways researchers design treatments for and study viruses.

AB The global COVID-19 pandemic has forced many educators to move their courses to the online environment with little time to adjust. It especially affected undergraduate biology laboratory courses that rely on on-campus facilities to provide students with meaningful laboratory-type experiences. Here we describe a multisession, at-home, and hands-on laboratory activity that utilizes yogurt culturing to explore microbiology concepts. We also summarize the findings of 219 undergraduate students who successfully performed this lab remotely. In small virtual groups, students learned how to make yogurt at home, formulate a testable hypothesis, run an experiment on conditions necessary for yogurt fermentation, analyze experimental results, and present their results to peers in an oral scientific talk. Practical considerations include the use of low-cost and accessible materials, low-tech yet effective quantification approaches, and online note-taking and data management tools to -coordinate group work and provide informal and formal assessment.

AB Barriers to transfer students include lost credit caused by lack of curricular alignment across institutions of higher learning. This is particularly evident in series courses like introductory biology. We propose to streamline transfer issues using a shared set of course-level learning outcomes (CLOs) developed collaboratively by faculty across multiple institutions. Our biggest challenge was the development of CLOs aligned to Vision and Change and broad enough for large-scale implementation. We present the CLOs generated by the Northwest Biosciences Consortium faculty network along with data on faculty buy-in to using Vision and Change in their curriculum. Additionally, we found an increased familiarity with and use of Vision and Change in curriculum development over time. Finally, we provide information on implementation of CLOs and suggestions of methods for aligning curricula across networks.

AB Educators usually teach the Mendelian inheritance model using Punnett squares to determine the probability of an offspring having a particular genotype and phenotype. To find the probability of an outcome of a particular cross, students need to understand the underlying biological concepts of these visual representations. However, this approach becomes more complex for cases with three or more characters and shies away from the authentic integration of mathematical and biological concepts. Therefore it is crucial for students to use mathematical algorithms that Mendel used to understand and solve inheritance problems. In this paper, we propose relating two simple probability rules to the laws of inheritance and using a probability tree diagram to predict the combined frequency of traits in the offspring of crosses. We validate the proposed probability rules for various examples.

AB In 1900, three botanists claimed they had found regularities in inheritance, which soon would be known as Mendel's Laws, without knowing the work of Gregor Mendel or of each other. Their claims of independent (re)discovery have been thoroughly studied during the past decades, with various outcomes. The case is still of interest today as it offers an interesting example of how science is done.

TI Online Instruction - Bioinformatics Lesson for a COVID-19 Vaccine

AB In the spring of 2020, remote learning was implemented in schools throughout the world due to the pandemic of SARS CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19. Thrust into online instruction, many science teachers scrambled during this transition, and classes were severely hampered by a lack of hands-on investigations involving critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response to a need for online experimentation, bioinformatics lessons centered around SARS-CoV-2 were developed. This article presents a multipart bioinformatics lesson that allows students to (1) compare spike protein sequences from the database portal NCBI Virus, to investigate whether this protein would be a good target for a vaccine against COVID-19; and (2) create phylogenetic trees and demonstrate evolutionary relatedness of human coronaviruses. This lesson allows for instruction in molecular biology, virology, immunology, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics, as well as analysis of scientific data. It is appropriate for high school AP Biology and biotechnology courses and can be taught entirely online.

   species; Next Generation Science Standards; real-world experience;
   willingness to pay
AB NGSS guidance indicates that a life science curriculum's unit on evolution must include the concepts of geologic ages, endangered species, Anthropocene extinction, and biodiversity. Enrichment lessons and labs deepen student understanding of key standards. This lesson enriches students by presenting a real-world opportunity for species conservation. First, instructors ensure a common understanding of background knowledge among students. Second, levels of species endangerment are introduced and students participate in a "willingness to pay" lab involving a philatelic-based fund to protect endangered species. Third, predicted student donation amounts are compared to actual costs needed to conserve and manage species in the wild. Finally, summative reports communicate actual conservation needs by comparing and contrasting two endangered species.

AB Can plants learn? This question stirs up controversy and speculation in the classroom, as it is currently doing in the scientific community at large. We leverage the controversy to ask students to contribute to the greater body of knowledge by using scientific principles in creative research projects. Ninth-grade honors biology students became familiar with original research and the surrounding controversy, and performed experiments testing two distinct forms of plant learning in Pisum sativum (pea) and Mimosa pudica (sensitive plant).

AB There have been multiple national calls for curricular reform in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including a need to instill democratic skills in students. Democratic skill building can be embedded in STEM classrooms through intentional "deliberative pedagogies" that include communication, collaboration, and application of information. We developed and implemented a deliberative pedagogy, Deliberative Democracy (DD), for introductory majors and nonmajors undergraduate biology courses and took a longitudinal, qualitative research approach to understand students' experiences and perceptions of DD. We asked students to respond to open-ended survey questions regarding DD at two time points and conducted semi-structured follow-up interviews. All data were iteratively open-coded using content analysis. Students' perceptions of DD were lasting and generally positive, including self-reported themes related to DD promoting their awareness of the "real-world applications of science," and increased "scientific literacy." Negative perceptions of DD were largely related to issues with "group dynamics." We detected differences between majors' and nonmajors' perceptions of DD, including in regard to scientific literacy and class time use. DD is a replicable pedagogy that can assist in instilling democratic skills in biology students.

AB Data collected in many biology laboratory classes are on ratio or interval scales where the size interval between adjacent units on the scale is constant, which is a critical requirement for analysis with parametric statistics such as t-tests or analysis of variance. In other cases, such as ratings of disease or behavior, data are collected on ordinal scales in which observations are placed in a sequence but the intervals between adjacent observations are not necessarily equal. These data can only be interpreted in terms of their order, not in terms of the differences between adjacent points. They are unsuitable for parametric statistical analyses and require a rank-based approach using nonparametric statistics. We describe an application of one such approach, the Kruskal-Wallis test, to biological data using online freeware suitable for classroom settings.

AB With ink teasing focus on active learning in college classrooms, many institutions of higher education are redesigning introductory laboratory classes to provide more active-learning opportunities for students and to more authentically recreate the practices of scientists. These classes are primarily taught by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), who often lack the pedagogical training necessary to plan for and support students' intellectual engagement in rich science tasks that require deep engagement in the practices of science and the core disciplinary ideas. We believe that graduate student discussion groups can provide an opportunity to encourage and equip GTAs with pedagogical knowledge and skills to select and use cognitively demanding instructional tasks. In this article, we describe our planning and facilitation of one such meeting with a group of GTAs about the relative cognitive demands of various laboratory activities. We propose that regularly scheduled meetings of discussion groups like this can help build learning communities among GTAs. We provide strategies to support GTAs' professional development and help them think critically about the tasks they use in their classes. In particular, we highlight the importance of the cognitive demands of tasks for engaging students in active and rigorous opportunities for science learning.

AB Students in a high school biology class were introduced to the case of "Marcus" (a pseudonym), a high school football player who collapsed on the football field during a game and was rushed to the emergency room with various symptoms. Throughout the two-week, project-based unit, students worked in cooperative groups to diagnose Marcus, learning about various inherited diseases and heat-related ailments that might impact young athletes. This unit integrates ultrasound technology into the classroom as a teaching and diagnostic technique and introduces students to health science careers. Student groups work to produce a final product that is presented to a public audience (e.g., parents, teachers, coaches) to increase their awareness of the science content underlying the causes of sudden collapses in young athletes. This learning experience ended with students individually writing a letter to Marcus's family explaining his diagnosis and the related biology concepts.

AB The use of Web-based informatics tools such as eBird, iNaturalist, and NatureAtlas that allow anyone to find and share occurrences and observations of organisms in nature could readily be integrated with the time-honored specimen collection and field journaling components of taxon-based natural history courses. We find, however, that fewer than 2% of such courses have used any such tool. Consequently, the far majority of students receive no formal exposure to the 21st-century technologies and concepts that are transforming the data landscapes of the very fields the courses should be preparing them to enter. We conducted a seven-year, empirical assessment of the integration of such technology with coursework, and our results reveal why recognizing and correcting this shortcoming is critical. Our data indicate that such technology can enhance student engagement and student perception of learning, and that its broader integration with coursework could be a boon to regional and global efforts to document and conserve biodiversity. We conclude that the academic community is missing a tremendous opportunity to better engage future biologists and potential citizen-scientists in a critically important, emergent paradigm in biodiversity informatics.

ID CONSERVATION; PREDICTION; ENTROPY
AB Open-souue data are information provided free online. It is gaining popularity in science research, especially for modeling species distribution. MaxEnt is an open-source software that models using presence-only data and environmental variables. These variables can also be found online and are generally free. Using all of these open-source data and tools makes species distribution modeling (SUM) more accessible. With the rapid changes our planet is undergoing, SDM helps understand future habitat suitability for species. Due to increasing interest in biogeographic research, SDM has increased for marine species, which were previously not commonly found in this modeling. Here we provide examples of where to obtain the data and how the modeling can be pa formed and taught.

TI An Inexpensive and Convenient Method to Culture Facultative Anaerobic
   Microorganisms from Yogurt
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE anaerobic culture; facultative anaerobes; yogurt bacteria; microbiology
AB It is often difficult for students grasp the concept that some organisms can grow in the absence of oxygen and that oxygen can be toxic to organisms. However, as educators usually describe in the classroom, the importance of the anaerobic growth of microorganisms can be seen in many areas of industry, health, and the creation of several categories of food ranging from fermented alcohols to breads and cheeses. To demonstrate that microorganisms can grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen, we have developed an inexpensive and easy technique to culture facultative anaerobic bacteria from yogurt in high school or undergraduate biology laboratories. Using the method discussed, which uses readily available and low-cost equipment, students can culture and visually identify facultative anaerobic bacteria that they may consume on a regular basis, demonstrating the utility of organisms that thrive in an anaerobic environment.

TI Botanical Phylo-Cards: A Tree-Thinking Game to Teach Plant Evolution
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article

ID SENSE EXCEPT; LIGHT
AB Students often have limited understanding of the major innovations in plant evolution. We developed a card sorting activity based on tree thinking that is suitable for students with a wide range of abilities and experience. Through this activity, students learn how scientists organize taxa into biologically meaningful, natural groups that illustrate important events in terrestrial plant evolution. The activity corresponds to several NGSS standards and is suitable for use in classroom or laboratory settings and as a public educational outreach activity.
   The Botanical Phylo-Card Game addresses several components of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013) such as Inheritance/Variation in Traits (3-LS3-1, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS4-2) and Natural Selection/Evolution (MS-LS4-2, HS-LS4-1). The game involves disciplinary core ideas about biodiversity, evolution, and common ancestry; crosscutting concepts regarding identification and interpretation of patterns; and scientific practices of constructing explanations and engaging in arguments from evidence that can guide individualized implementation and assessment of the activity by different instructors.

AB The current reform in U.S. science education calls for the integration of three dimensions of science learning in classroom teaching and learning: Science and Engineering Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas. While the Next Generation Science Standards provide flexibility in how curriculum and instruction are structured to meet learning goals, there are few examples of existing curricula that portray the integration of these dimensions as "three-dimensional learning." Here, we describe a collaborative board game about honey bees that incorporates scientific evidence on how genetic and environmental factors influence variations of traits and social behavior and requires students to collaboratively examine and use a system model. Furthermore, we show how students used and evaluated the game as a model in authentic classroom settings.

LA English
DT Article

ID STUDENTS; PLANTS
AB Teachers have reported that students enjoy growing plants but that logistical constraints such as limited space and inadequate lighting make it difficult to incorporate living plants into their classrooms. We present a method that takes familiar materials from the students' world - trading-card holders - and uses them to make interactive, cost-effective "plant pouches" that can function as living microscope slides. Students grow plants in card holders and are able to observe both the roots and shoots for several weeks, including making observations with a compound or dissecting microscope. The plant pouches require minimal space or resources, and the system is flexible enough to accommodate different types of plants and is amenable to experimentation.

DE PCR; onion; genetics; trait; genotype; phenotype; biochemistry
ID ONIONS ALLIUM-CEPA; PINK TRAIT; STUDENTS; MUTATION
AB Instructors often present Mendelian genetics and molecular biology separately. As a result, students often fail to connect the two topics in a tangible manner. We have adopted a simple experiment to help link these two important topics in a basic biology course, using red and white onions bought from a local grocery store. A lack of red coloration in white onions is a result of one or more mutations in the color production pathway. This mutation can be seen by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by gel electrophoresis. An absence of an amplified PCR product for one of the genes necessary for color production is associated with a lack of color production - an obvious trait in white onion. The students are able to "see" the difference at the DNA level between the red and white onion.

AB The behavior of animals is an intrinsically fascinating topic for students from a wide array of backgrounds. We describe a learning experience using animal behavior that we created for middle school students as part of a graduate-student outreach program, Graduate Partners in Science Education, at Arizona State University in collaboration with a K-8 public school. This activity capitalizes on the interest that animal behavior can generate to introduce and reinforce student understanding of the scientific method. Specifically, our activity highlights the general utility of the scientific method and uses this method to examine ant social behavior, with emphasis on generating and testing hypotheses. Furthermore, this activity introduces the idea of animal societies and encourages students to apply the concepts they learn to other species, including humans. By collecting ants locally, from schoolyards or nearby habitats, this experience situates learning in the context of students' own communities. We also provide optional assessment materials that teachers can use to assess learning objectives and standard mastery.

AB Anyone who has taught an introductory biology lab has sat at their desk in front of a towering stack of lengthy lab reports and wondered if there was a better way to teach scientific writing. We propose the use of a one-page format that we have called a "mini-report," which we believe better allows students to understand the structure and characteristics of proper scientific writing and reduces the grading-time investment for instructors.

They will ultimately place each specimen on a basic phylogenetic tree that also reveals the geological time frame in which each species lived. On the basis of their data, and using similar scientific methods as paleoanthropologists, students will come to evidence-based conclusions about hominin evolution similar to those accepted by the scientific community (e.g., Tattersall & Schwartz, 2001; Sawyer et al., 2007; Palmer, 2010).

ID ALLIARIA-PETIOLATA
AB Invasive species are a substantial threat to biodiversity. Educating students about invasive species introduces fundamental concepts in biology, ecology, and environmental science. In the Race to Displace game, students assume the characteristics of select native or introduced plants and experience first hand the influences of species interactions and changing environmental conditions on community composition as they advance across a game board. Through game play, students learn about ways in which species can interact, as well as attributes of successful invaders and the impacts of invasion on communities.

DT Editorial Material
DE Terrarium; exhibit; pet; filtration; plants
AB Terrariums have decorated the shelves and counters of biology offices and classrooms for centuries. Living organisms inspire students and teachers alike. These wonderful ecosystems allow for both experimentation and observation of living systems. Here, I outline a new approach to building classroom terrariums. Historically, terrariums have been made using rocks, gravel, soil, wood, leaves, and organic props. This process often creates an immovable terrarium that weighs several hundred pounds. Although this approach will continue to produce beautiful terrariums, new technology has given us the opportunity to create more intricate terrariums that are a fraction of the weight and, therefore, mobile. The step-by-step protocol given here will allow biology professionals with little experience building terrariums an opportunity to explore this rewarding practice.

ID INHERITANCE
AB Most biology texts villify Lamarck's concept of "inheritance of acquired characters" and leave the impression that all acquired characters are never transmitted to offspring. However, recent research indicates that this is not true! Some "acquired" traits are inherited. I profile some of these striking cases and their importance for evolution and for understanding a broader epigenetic context for heredity and ontogeny (the emerging field of "evo-devo"). Further, I discuss how such cases, even considered as exceptions, contribute to understanding the nature of science, both the role of general rules in biology and the occurrence of conceptual change, or paradigm shifts.

Not only is this approach more environmentally friendly, it also forces them to learn human anatomy - which is more relevant to them than the anatomy of other creatures - in a creative and constructive manner. The article includes photos of students' work, a table for evaluation (grading rubric), and a list of materials, as well as some helpful hints.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DE Human evolution; comparison of human and chimpanzee skeletons;
   australopithecines
ID ETHIOPIA; HADAR
AB Mainstream scientists often claim that australopithecines such as the specimen nicknamed "Lucy" exhibit anatomy intermediate between that of apes and that of humans and use this as evidence that humans evolved from australopithecines, which evolved from apes. On the other hand, creationists reject evolution and claim that australopithecines are "just apes." Here, a point-by-point visual comparison with the skeletons of a chimpanzee, "Lucy," and a human is presented in order to evaluate both claims, treating them as testable hypotheses. The results support the hypothesis that australopithecines are anatomically intermediate between apes and humans. Classroom applications of this test of hypotheses are also discussed.

AB Students working in groups experience positive outcomes in both academic and affective domains. Well-functioning groups contribute to a robust, active-learning classroom community. The literature contains a vast assortment of methods for the formation of student groups; nonetheless, the formation and evaluation of student groups formed by various methods continue to be valuable topics for research and discussion. Here we describe the mutual preference method (MPM), a novel procedure for group formation that pairs students based on a list of preferred collaborators that each student generates. The MPM is a unique approach to group formation meant to capitalize on existing student social structures, increase metacognition, promote habits in professionalism, and create productive groups.

AB We present data displaying course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) effectiveness in providing authentic cutting-edge research experiences to undergraduates, which both private and government organizations recognize as essential. A total of 68 students were enrolled in this research with 50 students being in a traditional laboratory course and 18 students participating in the CURE implemented laboratory. Results from mid- and postsemester surveys were compared to assess knowledge and attitude. Knowledge showed no change; however, students who experienced the CURE responded with increased enjoyment, strong feelings of scientific contribution, and high project ownership, and overall they were more confident in research than their non-CURE peers.

ID RISK
AB Understanding the main causes of biodiversity decline is an essential part of the syllabus of any university-level course in conservation biology. A novel computer-based activity is described for introducing students to using the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List database. The specific objectives of this activity are (1) to understand the main causes that threaten species worldwide and, if these causes differ, to try to elucidate the underlying processes that might be responsible for these differences in a given country and (2) to train students how to use digital biological data platforms, such as the IUCN Red List, and how to analyze and interpret biological data. To achieve these goals, students must obtain information from the IUCN Red List to assess why species are threatened globally and in a given country. Based on the total number of threatened species, students calculate the percentage of species affected by each threat within each Red List category and for all categories combined both globally and at the national level. The activity ends with a discussion in the classroom where the students are expected to share their interpretations about the main causes that threaten biodiversity at different scales of analysis and the applications of their findings in a conservation context. The activity is expected to increase the awareness of students regarding environmental issues and to develop different key competencies and basic skills as learning outcomes, including expertise in biological diagnosis, information management, and using the internet as an information source.

   through Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are high-impact practices that allow students to conduct research during class time. Benefits of a CURE can be maximized when integrated into a faculty membeti ongoing research. However, this can be particularly challenging for field biologists, especially when field sites are not situated near their university. Indeed, few existing CUREs are field based. One solution is to partner with a collaborator near the field site. We describe a semester-long CURE in an animal behavior class that involved collaboration among three institutions: researchers from two "distant" institutions have ongoing research at the "local" institution where the CURE took place. This model uses remote conferencing and strategic collaboration to meet all stakeholders' needs. Undergraduate students engaged as active participants in collaborative inquiry-based work, learned in a cooperative context, and even participated in the publication process. The local principal investigator and their institution generated a high-impact course that integrated research and teaching. Likewise, the distant principal investigators were able to collect more extensive and longer-term field-based data than otherwise possible, and they gained valuable input from the local researchers that contributed to future projects. Remote collaborations open the door to international collaboration with smaller institutions, promoting greater inclusion in science.

AB Core chemistry ideas can be useful tools for explaining biological phenomena, but students often have difficulty understanding these core ideas within general chemistry. Connecting these ideas to biologically relevant situations is even more difficult. These difficulties arise, in part, from a lack of explicit opportunities in relevant courses for students to practice connecting ideas across disciplines. We are developing activities that examine students' abilities to connect core chemistry ideas with biological phenomena, the overall goal being to develop a set of assessments that ask students to connect their knowledge across introductory chemistry and biology courses. Here, we describe the development and testing of an activity that focuses on concepts about energy in bond breaking, bond forming, and ATP coupling. The activity was completed by 195 students in an introductory cell and molecular biology course at Michigan State University; students were either co-enrolled or previously enrolled in General Chemistry I. Follow-up interviews to assess the validity of the activity (among others) showed that students interpreted the questions as intended and that they valued the activity as an opportunity to connect ideas across courses.

AB Biodiversity and sustainability are key words of modern nature-of-science teaching. While most studies use rather abstract examples for biodiversity loss, we focused on habitats that students are familiar with. Our module was developed to deepen the understanding of domestic botanical ecosystems by having students work with and on designated pasture areas. The economic implications of sustainability were addressed by contrasting intensive and extensive agriculture, as well as by touching upon topics such as organic labels and modern agriculture. By focusing on domestic ecosystems within everyday contexts, combined with digital teaching methods, we successfully increased individual knowledge levels when taking before-and-after participation scores into account. Based on these results, we conclude that our approach to using different forms of pasture on the school grounds is a promising way to improve students' understanding of the economic and ecological implications of sustainability.

AB An in-depth curricular unit exploring the effects of human land use on local water resources was created as part of a Teacher Professional Learning Program at the University of Connecticut's Natural Resources Conservation Academy. This unit was designed to connect high school students to water resources in their community, both in the field and through the use of interactive mapping technology. These methods engage students in science and technology using multiple disciplines and can help them better understand how their local water resource is affected by the surrounding landscape. In this unit, students explore the dynamics of local water resources and the anthropogenic issues that affect them through field and open-access online inquiry-based activities. The varied lessons within this unit were purposefully created to align with the Next Generation Science Standards and to fit within either an earth science or a biology course. They use existing online geospatial tools and can be tailored to any geographic area of interest.

DT Article
DE inquiry driven; laboratory; protocols; theoretical learning; procedural

AB We present a novel adaptation of a typical science laboratory protocol, which we have termed multi-view protocols (MVPs). The purpose of MVPs is to answer and link three common questions asked by students when first learning a laboratory technique: (1) What am I supposed to do? (2) Where and how am I supposed to do it? (3) What exactly am I doing, anyway? The intent of MVPs is to facilitate parallel comprehension of both the physical "movements" of a technique and the theoretical principles behind each step of a protocol. With MVPs, we achieve this through three parallel columns that include a textual description of the protocol, photographs of the protocol being performed in the laboratory space, and an illustrative column that visually depicts the molecular details of the corresponding steps. Variations of MVPs may include having students create one or more of the parallel columns themselves. In the age of near ubiquitous high-resolution camera phones, MVPs are a practical and efficient way to simultaneously teach laboratory method and theory, adaptable to nearly any laboratory protocol.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that makes up a small fraction of Earth's atmosphere. Despite its inconspicuous nature, CO2 plays an integral part in sustaining life on Earth, a part that is largely unknown or underappreciated by the general public. We present a set of activities designed to help students overcome the most common misunderstandings about CO2, from its sheer existence as a mass-containing molecule to its complementary roles in photosynthesis and respiration. Through these activities, students will be able to apply their knowledge to real-world phenomena, including weight loss and global warming.

AB The role of the electron transport chain, its associated proteins, and carrier molecules can be difficult for introductory biology students to understand. Role-playing activities provide a simple, active, cost-effective method for demonstrating and comprehending complex biological processes. This role-playing activity was designed to help introductory biology students learn the role of the electron transport chain in the synthesis of ATP. The activity can be completed within a single class period and, when combined with a post-activity writing assignment, can enhance student understanding of how the electron transport chain functions.

AB Evolution explains both the unity and the diversity of all organisms, and developing students' ability to represent and communicate evolutionary relationships is an important component of a complete biology education. We present a series of student-centered, exploratory activities to help students develop their tree-thinking skills. In these activities, students use complementary phenotypic and molecular data to explore how to build phylogenetic trees and interpret the evolutionary relationships they represent. This learning module is designed to engage students in the process of science, provide them with active learning experiences using online bioinformatics tools, and foster their appreciation for the evolutionary connections across the tree of life.

AB We describe an interdisciplinary research project for undergraduate students involving microbiology and public health. Students designed and carried out two research studies on hand hygiene and the use of gloves by mobile food vendors in New York City and in a New Jersey mall. Students received training in aseptic techniques and survey methodology to carry out the multifaceted study. We discuss the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and research in the context of its value in preparing professionals in the fields of biology and public health.

AB Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is a recently established discipline that connects evolutionary theory with developmental biology. However, despite evo-cievo's integral use of diverse insect taxa as model systems and its interdisciplinary approach, current introductory entomology textbooks fail to fully integrate evo-devo into the undergraduate curriculum. We argue that an evo-devo case-study-based approach, focused on adult development, will not only familiarize students with exciting findings in this field, but will also help them deepen their understanding of basic entomological concepts. After a short background of the most important findings and methods currently used in evo-devo, we outline five case vignettes that span a variety of insect groups and entomological topics, including morphology and sexual selection.

AB Changing climate conditions pose challenges for many migratory birds, and their responses to these challenges can depend on their biology. To illustrate these impacts, I developed a board game to help elementary school students understand these challenges. The use of the game provides an opportunity to further discuss changes in phenology, the timing of life cycle events, in response to a changing climate.

AB In this lesson students will use the Penicillium chrysogenum fungus, which naturally produces the antibiotic penicillin, to investigate the effect of naturally produced antibiotics on bacteria in laboratory cultures. Students co-culture P. chrysogenum with three species of bacteria to observe differences between penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive bacteria. They will normalize fungal spore suspension and bacterial culture concentrations before inoculating co-cultures. After bacteria have been exposed to the antibiotic, students will quantify culture density to determine antibiotic effect in liquid culture and on solid media. Students will learn about natural product antibiotics as well as experimental design and application.

ID PLANT
AB Different methods and strategies for teaching scientific knowledge have been proposed and integrated within existing classroom dynamics. These represent opportunities for reinforcing and teaching scientific concepts in the classroom, especially in ways that students can easily understand. In this article, we propose a dynamic classroom activity for teaching ecological interactions between plants and frugivorous birds, as an example. This same model could also be used or adapted to teach diverse ecological concepts to students. This teaching strategy is divided into two parts: (1) a theoretical class, and (2) a group activity that we called The Ecological Interactions Olympiad. We describe this method step-by-step and provide suggestions for applying it to other scientific topics. The aim of using such learning strategies is to increase the attention and interest of young students in scientific topics and to improve their critical thinking skills and awareness of the events and interactions that occur in nature, which could ultimately contribute to the conservation of nature.

AB Plant-pathogen interactions are often omitted as a topic in most introductory and upper-level biology courses. The infection process of the plant pathogen Pythium irregulare on the moss Mnium cuspidatum can be observed and exploited to provide lessons on host-pathogen responses, as well as introduce other biological topics such as microscopy, spectrophotometry, and enzymes. Students can qualitatively analyze plant responses to pathogen infection using microscopy and observe quantitative enzyme responses to draw conclusions. Students are also encouraged to generate hypotheses and test them using this biological system as a method to develop scientific skills.

AB The photosynthetic bioreactor research program is a training platform appropriate for introducing advanced molecular biology techniques to undergraduate students and advanced high school biology students. For this advanced molecular biology training exercise, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase was cloned, over-expressed, purified, and functionally characterized. Carbonic anhydrases are industrially important enzymes with potential use in carbon sequestration and biofuel production. Alpha and beta carbonic anhydrases from Photobacterium profundum, a psychrophilic, halotolerant bacterium, were characterized in this study. Carbonic anhydrases that can withstand high salinity and are active at low temperatures can be transformed into oleaginous marine microalgae to enhance biofuel production. Our research program started with a three-day boot camp with lectures in relevant topics of molecular biology, microbiology, and research methods. After the boot camp, the lab phase of the project involved training students to perform polymerase chain reaction, DNA gel electrophoresis, DNA ligation, and bacterial transformation. In the final phase of the project, students were trained in recombinant protein over-expression and protein purification techniques. Here we report successful cloning and over-expression by high school students of two novel carbonic anhydrases from a psychrohalophile with application in biofuel production.

AB National STEM education reform efforts call for increased emphasis on science practices, such as modeling. We describe an activity where students read a scientific blog post relating human gametogenesis to disease and then during class develop a model explaining why defects in meiotic machinery cause this disease. This interactive activity was implemented in two sections of an introductory biology course, each exceeding 150 students. Overall, students responded positively to the activity, and based on follow-up exam questions addressing the main learning goals of the modeling activity, about 70 percent of students mastered the learning objectives associated with the modeling activity.

AB Traditional transcription-translation exercises are instructionally incomplete by failing to link prescriptive genetic information with protein structure and function. The T3 Method solves this problem by adding a conceptually powerful yet easily learned third step where students use simple protein folding codes to transform their translations into corresponding protein structural models. This brings structural sense to sequence and makes the information-to-proteins connection that is so profoundly important to understand in biology more directly evident, experiential, and intrinsically meaningful. The T3 Method has further utility, proving versatile and adaptive to a wide range of academic levels and learning contexts, with possibilities for differentiated instruction, application, and extension.

Unfortunately, many challenges exist that inhibit both its introduction and implementation in the high school biology classroom. We present a reliable yet inexpensive way of effectively simulating this assay, allowing student exposure to several advanced topics, including immunodetection, clinical diagnostics, and qualitative and quantitative colorimetric analysis.

AB Simple teaching experiments demonstrating endocrinological concepts are difficult to come by. I discuss a simple experiment demonstrating control of cutaneous drinking by the hormone angiotensin II in terrestrial toads, designed after methods published in the primary literature and presented herein to make this exercise more widely accessible to ABT readers. This experiment is notable in that it (1) permits students to quantify both a physiological and a behavioral response to exogenous hormone administration; (2) can be implemented in relatively small class sizes; (3) does not require animal euthanasia; and (4) can be accomplished in one class period. Furthermore, data collection can be easily carried out by students using common laboratory supplies, and analysis and interpretation of the collected data are straightforward. Finally, in demonstrating the function of the highly conserved renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, this hands-on experiment has obvious clinical connections relevant to human medicine (e.g., blood-pressure regulation and treatment of hypertension).

AB Engaging students in the process of science to increase learning and critical thinking has become a key emphasis in undergraduate education. Introducing environmental topics, such as the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, into undergraduate courses offers a new means to increase student engagement. Daphnia magna can serve as a model organism for endocrine disruption, and its ease of handling, rapid reproduction rate, and clearly defined endpoints make it useful in short-term, student research projects. The concept of endocrine disruption can be tested through a 21-day reproductive study of D. magna exposed to varying concentrations of the pesticide fenoxycarb. Students will observe an altered reproduction rate and increased production of males under conditions that would typically result only in the production of female offspring. This research system allows students to formulate hypotheses, set up experiments, analyze data, and present results, leading to a greater appreciation of and interest in science.

AB Creating partnerships that leverage skill sets from universities and corporate entities to improve STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education is often discussed in theory. However, examples of successful models that might inform practice are scarce. This article describes how one STEM business, university educators, and middle school administrators and teachers successfully developed and implemented an integrated STEM education (iSTEM) experience for all eighth-grade students at a local middle school. We created a professional learning community to establish the goals and vision for the iSTEM day, which included the use of instructionally sound pedagogical methods, intellectually stimulating learning experiences, and a deeply developed understanding of the school context. Our team successfully completed a one-day learning experience that focused on the fundamental concept of osmosis and problem-solving skills. However, the broader impacts of this day included a new collaborative network between the university, the company, and the middle school that remains intact and productive.

AB Microbial cultures swiftly adapt to lethal agents such as antibiotics or viruses by acquiring resistance mutations. Does this remarkable adaptability require a Lamarckian explanation, whereby the agent specifically directs resistance mutations? Soon after the question arose, Luria and Delbruck devised a clever experiment, the fluctuation test, that answered this question in the negative: microbial adaptation, they showed, is entirely consistent with a Darwinian explanation. Their 1943 article is a classic of biology literature, with practical and theoretical implications that continue to expand today. Implementing an updated fluctuation test in a college teaching lab provides a simple experimental setting in which beginning students learn to apply basic principles of evolutionary biology and scientific reasoning, while gaining hands-on experience in core technical advances of contemporary life science.

AB The compound microscope is an important tool in biology, and mastering it requires repetition. Unfortunately, introductory activities for students can be formulaic, and consequently, students are often unengaged and fail to develop the required experience to become proficient in microscopy. To engage students, increase repetition, and develop identification skills, we have them use the microscope as a problem-solving tool to examine prepared slides of microfossils and microartifacts from a simulated archeology site to determine its paleobiogeographic history.

DE Active learning; corn; hypothesis generation; inquiry; maize; Zea mays
AB The AAAS Vision and Change report (2011) recommends incorporating student research experiences into the biology curriculum at the undergraduate level. This article describes, in detail, how Zea mays (corn) cultivars were used as a model for a hypothesis-driven short-term research project in an introductory biology course at a small Midwestern university. During the course of this project, student groups generated a research question and hypothesis, designed an experiment, collected data, and reported their findings in a paper modeled after the primary literature. Throughout the project, students experienced first hand the obstacles and accomplishments associated with the process of scientific research and gained a greater understanding of plant biology. By demonstrating biology as a dynamic field centered around hypothesis generation and experimentation, the authors observed an increase in student dedication, interest, and enthusiasm for the course.

ID HIGH-SCHOOL BIOLOGY; EDUCATION
AB Little empirical evidence suggested that independent reading abilities of students enrolled in biology predicted their performance on the Biology I Graduation End-of-Course Assessment (ECA). An archival study was conducted at one Indiana urban public high school in Indianapolis, Indiana, by examining existing educational assessment data to test whether a relationship between reading proficiency and student performance on the Biology I ECA existed. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was r = 0.712 (P < 0.01). A strong positive relationship between Biology I ECA and Lexile reading scores accounted for 50.7% of the variance. The results suggested that any measure to increase reading levels would increase standardized biology assessment scores.

ID SCIENCE; INQUIRY
AB Argumentation is now seen as a core practice for helping students engage with the construction and critique of scientific ideas and for making students scientifically literate. This article demonstrates a negotiation model to show how argumentation can be a vehicle to drive students to learn science's big ideas. The model has six phases: creating a testable question, conducting an investigation cooperatively, constructing an argument in groups, negotiating arguments publicly, consulting the experts, and writing and reflecting individually. A fifth-grade classroom example from a unit on the human body serves as an example to portray how argumentation can be integrated into science classrooms.

AB Formal professional development programs for biology graduate students interested in becoming faculty members have come far; however, programs that provide advanced teaching experience for seasoned graduate teaching assistants are scarce. We outline an advanced program that focuses on further training of graduate teaching assistants in pedagogy and mentoring opportunities within a biology department. The Graduate Teaching Scholars Program provides opportunities for individualized instruction and learning while working with a faculty mentor. Graduate teaching scholars attend workshops, have their teaching evaluated, and serve as mentors for new graduate teaching assistants in the department. Students in the program are able to contribute to departmental education initiatives while growing professionally as teachers and future faculty.

They work in groups to develop hypotheses about what animal they have found, what environment it inhabited, and what niche it filled. At the end of the activity, the groups participate in a defense and peer review of their findings. This activity develops students' knowledge of the nature of science, evidence for evolution, and individual thinking and reasoning skills.

TI Witnessing Evolution First Hand: A K-12 Laboratory Exercise in Genetics
   & Evolution Using <i>Drosophila</i>
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Drosophila; evolution; genetics; natural selection
AB We present a laboratory exercise that leverages student interest in genetics to observe and understand evolution by natural selection. Students begin with white-eyed fruit fly populations, to which they introduce a single advantageous variant (one male with red eyes). The superior health and vision associated with having the red-eye-color allele confers a fitness advantage, and the students can watch the spread of the allele within the population. The increasing numbers of red-eyed flies they observe over generations demonstrate evolution by natural selection. The students concurrently learn genetic principles, including basic inheritance and X-linkage.

DT Article
DE Ammonoids; function morphology; restricted geometry
AB The primary decorative flooring tile in the Southpark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina, is fossiliferous limestone that contains Jurassic ammonoids and belemnoids. Visible in these tiles are more than 500 ammonoids, many of which have been cross sectioned equatorially perpendicular to the plane of coiling. Upper-level undergraduate students from UNC Charlotte used this data set to measure ammonoid coiling geometry and, thus, coiling strategy, and their findings were compared with earlier reported research presented in highly respected paleobiology journals. This example of urban paleobiology utilized a large, easily accessible, and readily available fossil data set to introduce functional morphology of coiled cephalopods. Similar data sets are available in public buildings around the United States, providing a valuable fossil resource at a time when shrinking academic budgets would prohibit purchasing such a collection (and many collections have not been updated in decades). As students compared their results with those previously published by professional paleontologists, they were exposed to the methods and limits of the scientific method in the historical sciences, as well as the dangers of poor sample selection.

ID GROMPHADORHINA-PORTENTOSA
AB Teaching and learning animal anatomy has a long history in the biology classroom. As in many fields of biology, decades of experience teaching anatomy have led to the unofficial selection of model species. However, in some cases the model may not be the best choice for our students. Our struggle to find an appropriate model for teaching and learning insect anatomy has resulted in experiments with a variety of species. In our experience, none of the available models seems as useful as the Madagascar hissing cockroach. In this article, we advocate the use of this species in laboratory studies of insect anatomy.

AB We describe a simple field study that we have found useful in introducing students to experimental design. Students manipulate the nutritive gain available from flowers to test the hypothesis that the foraging behavior of nectarivorous insects maximizes energy gain rate. They add sucrose solution to some flowers and water to others; additional flowers are left unmanipulated. Visit durations of foraging butterflies are then measured to test the prediction that individuals will forage longer at patches that offer higher energy gains. The project encourages students to consider how a study's design influences the results obtained, and helps to develop scientific reasoning skills.

Because shoots, leaves, and other plant parts grow larger on plants undergoing compensation, they typically fall outside of the normal ranges given in plant identification keys and confuse students who are attempting to classify them. Here, we describe the conundrum faced by students collecting compensatory materials and offer suggestions on how to help students identify their "plant-in-hand" and how to seize a teaching moment to examine and explain the underlying processes that lead to this fascinating plant response.

AB Many biology students are drawn to medically oriented topics. This lab activity engages students with medical interests in botany. I find that students are interested in how plants can have medical applications, for example in pharmaceuticals. Several volatile oils of plants, such as thyme, oregano, tea tree, and black pepper oils, have been found to have antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral properties. To further their interest in the plant kingdom, teachers can have students test a variety of essential oils for effectiveness as antibiotics. This activity requires only minimal microbiology technique and is appropriate for high school through introductory college biology and botany courses.

AB Authentic assessment exercises are similar to real-world tasks that would be expected by a professional. An authentic assessment in combination with an inquiry-based learning activity enhances students' learning and rehearses them for their future roles, whether as scientists or as informed citizens. Over a period of 2 years, we experimented with two inquiry-based projects; one had traditional scientific inquiry characteristics, and the other used popular culture as the medium of inquiry. We found that activities that incorporated group learning motivated students and sharpened their abilities to apply and communicate their knowledge of science. We also discovered that incorporating popular culture provided "Millennial" students with a refreshing view of science learning and increased their appetites to explore and elaborate on science.

AB Genotyping real alleles in real people is an excellent way to connect abstract genetics concepts to human variation in the classroom; however, these activities can inadvertently promote misconceptions of the power of genetics to determine individual and group traits. By analyzing our own and others' experiences of genotyping activities in the classroom, we illustrate the types of problems encountered and propose solutions. We find that genotyping activities can be an effective learning experience for genetics students when instructors use a nuanced approach to these activities emphasizing the predictive utility of genotyping, avoiding racializing or differentially valuing genotypes, and promoting good communication in the classroom.

AB One of the important mechanisms in cancer cell metastasis is the cellular function of a specific cell type called myofibroblast cells. Myofibroblast cells are unique cell types that play an important role in the cancer cell microenvironment. As a step toward integrating the latest peer-reviewed cancer research findings into a general biology remote learning setting, we developed an innovative guest speaker talk to engage first-year undergraduates to develop a prediction on tumor microenvironment. In our article, we describe integrated remote approaches using Jamboard and reflective mentoring to validate and reflect on undergraduate team responses within an inclusive and equitable framework. These teaching and mentoring strategies provide a framework for senior undergraduates to be transformative role model scholars that inspire the next generation of Latinx and Native American undergraduates in important topics related to health and environment and the process of science for general biology undergraduates.

AB The use of virtual reality (VR) as a medium for education can contribute to the learning efficiency of students. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of VR application in advanced biology courses, specifically in enhancing the comprehension and understanding of high school students toward the topic of human organs and other related systems. Four high school teachers and 138 high school students selected from three separate classes participated in this study. To determine the impact of VR education from both teachers' and students' perspectives, learning satisfaction and the effectiveness of instructional material were assessed with questionnaires. We found that from teachers' perspective, VR was an efficient teaching tool that enhanced students' attention and contributed to the improvement of learning outcomes. From the students' perspective, they were willing to use VR instructional material and were satisfied with this learning method. Applying VR technology in the classroom should be encouraged. However, some students identified dizziness as a concern when VR glasses were used for longer periods of time. Therefore, we suggest that VR glasses be limited to 30 minutes of use at a time.

ID SCIENCE; INSTRUCTION
AB Conceptual teaching was developed three decades ago as an alternative to conventional teaching approaches. It promised a significant shift in teaching practices across different disciplines and age groups. Traditionally, science subjects in high school tend to be content-heavy. Teaching science, especially biology, is still rooted in teaching methods that facilitate factual understanding and low-road transfer of knowledge. As a result, students' knowledge remains compartmentalized. Students rarely make connections with other disciplines and transfer their biological knowledge to new situations. Bringing concepts to biology is a challenging task. Despite compelling evidence for concept-based teaching, there are few examples of how it can be implemented and replace content-based teaching. This article describes the changes to teaching instructions in biology over the last decade as well as the main challenges that prevent incorporating novel teaching approaches in a biology classroom. The author suggests concept-based teaching as an effective alternative to conventional, content focused teaching and offers some ideas for implementing concepts into teaching biology in the context of blended learning.

AB Effective laboratory and classroom demonstration of microbiome size and shape, diversity, and ecological relationships is hampered by a lack of high-resolution, easy-to-use, readily accessible physical or digital models for use in teaching. Three-dimensional (3D) representations are, overall, more effective in communicating visuospatial information, allowing for a better understanding of concepts not directly observable with the unaided eye. Published morphology descriptions and microscopy images were used as the basis for designing 3D digital models, scaled at 20,000x, using computer-aided design software (CAD) and generating printed models of bacteria on mass-market 3D printers. Sixteen models are presented, including rod-shaped, spiral, flask-like, vibroid, and filamentous bacteria as well as different arrangements of cocci. Identical model scaling enables direct comparison as well as design of a wide range of educational plans.

AB The current COVID-19 pandemic shows how little many people know about viruses. Yet apart from COVID-19, the world has observed epidemic spread of another SARS virus, of the Ebola virus, and of the Zika virus during the last two decades. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is still one of the most dangerous viruses worldwide. Some types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) are the main cause of cervical cancer. Cases of measles, also caused by a virus, increase in numbers due to lack of access to or refusal of vaccination. Furthermore, there is the widespread belief that viruses are similar to bacteria and may thus be fought off with antibiotics. Yet viruses have no metabolism. Thus, antibiotics cannot work against them, but may instead cause more harm than help, given side effects such as killing beneficial bacteria (e. g., in the intestine). Second, misuse of antibiotics is one key factor in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains - a strong public health issue nowadays. This article informs readers what viruses are, how they are distinct from bacteria, how they may have evolved, and how diseases they cause may be prevented. Additionally, insights from studies concerning students' virus-related knowledge are summarized.

AB Engaging undergraduates in the mechanisms of post-translational modifications lies at the heart of molecular and cell biology education. An important challenge for science educators is developing inclusive and equitable approaches and hands-on demonstrations to clarify post-translational modification mechanisms, such as the protein-splicing mechanism called split inteins. Here, we describe step-by-step assembly of recycled materials to help clarify the molecular action of split inteins in inclusive classroom teaching settings.

ID MARINE POLLUTION; ACCUMULATION; DEBRIS
AB Microplastic pollution is an environmental threat with substantial effects on ecosystems. Persistence and ubiquity are the central causes of the problems microplastics generate, especially throughout water-based food webs. To limit microplastic pollution, accountability of individuals is needed, which requires reliable information for an individual to act accordingly. Knowledge about sources, contamination, fate, and effects of microplastic in the environment may be an essential element in enhancing students' motivation and sense of responsibility. Our module "Plastic Detectives - The Search for Plastic" offers consciousness-raising tasks that involve students in hands-on learning activities. Within student-centered activities, different tasks on sources in everyday life, sinks in aquatic ecosystems, effects on marine animals, and prevention strategies for microplastics are in focus. With an appropriate overview, students may be sufficiently enabled to ponder their purchase decisions and potentially limit microplastic pollution in everyday life.

AB The process of meiosis is an essential topic that secondary and postsecondary students struggle with. The important meiosis-related concepts of homology, ploidy, and segregation can be described using the DNA Triangle framework, which connects them to the multidimensional nature of DNA (chromosomal, molecular, and informational levels). We have previously established that undergraduate biology students typically fail to describe and/or link appropriate levels to their explanations of meiosis. We hypothesize that students' understanding mirrors the resources they are given - in other words, textbook ARM often lack many of the important connections that experts include when talking about meiosis. Prior work showed that text in meiosis chapters typical ly fails to include many concepts that experts consider important, so we examined how textbook figures present meiosis concepts. We found that almost all textbook representations include the chromosomal level of DNA, but few include the other levels, even to illustrate concepts that are rooted in informational and/or molecular levels. In particular, the molecular level of DNA was absent from nearly all introductory textbook figures examined, and the informational level was seldom depicted in mid/upper-level textbook figures. The previously established deficits in text portions of textbooks are clearly not compensated by their accompanying illustrations.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE fake news; vaccines; climate change; evolution
AB Fake news and alternative science are increasingly popular topics of conversation in the public sphere and the classroom due to increasingly far-reaching social media and a shifting political climate. Promoting scientific literacy by providing opportunities for students to evaluate reports of contentious scientific issues and analyze the underlying factors that influence public perception of science is necessary for the development of an informed citizenry. This article describes a three-part learning activity useful for engaging biology students in evaluating the accuracy of science-related news reports, and reflecting upon the ways that social cues, religion, and political ideologies shape perception of science. These activities are appropriate for teaching about climate change, evolution, vaccines, and other important contemporary scientific issues in upper-level high school and undergraduate science courses.

AB What is the role of wonder in a classroom? And how does a teacher activate this most human of emotions? This paper investigates the role wonder-and the subjects most closely associated with it, art and science-should play in our students' school lives. The work connects my lived experiences as a high school teacher and college professor with the philosophy of John Dewey and contemporary literature on pedagogical practices. My findings suggest that it is a moral imperative to encourage wonder in our classrooms and to do so in an authentic way.

   EXPLANATION; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK
AB Evolution education in the United States remains controversial and challenging. This is in part due to the difficulty educators face when trying to overcome students' preexisting beliefs about evolution, which can bias assimilation of information and inhibit learning. We propose that the most effective way to overcome such belief persistence is through an engaging, hands-on inquiry approach that mimics the scientific process used to study evolution. Although this teaching approach, known as authentic science, has gained recognition for its effectiveness in the classroom, it has not been widely applied to teach evolution. We describe how an authentic science approach can be used to teach evolution by natural selection, and provide a formula for the development of such programs. Following this blueprint, we developed a program using Trinidadian guppies and implemented it in 7th grade classrooms in Colorado. Pre- and post-program assessments revealed significant increases in both the understanding and acceptance of evolution among participants. Authentic science experiments using locally adapted populations of live organisms may be able to overcome belief persistence and improve student understanding of evolution.

TI Supporting Evolution by Responding to "Missing Link" Arguments
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE evolution; missing links; critical thinking; transitional species
AB The missing link argument is a common challenge raised by students to evolutionary theory; it notes that the majority of evolutionary transitions are not represented in the fossil record. A typical response is to present examples of fossils that have a combination of ancestral and derived traits, but I argue that this approach is largely ineffective because it does not address the broader question of whether the fossil record accords better with evolutionary theory than with creationist narratives. A better response is to agree that the fossil record is largely incomplete because fossilization is rare, and to direct the conversation toward addressing how a rich, yet incomplete, collection of evidence can be reasonably interpreted. Evolutionary theory and creationism pose starkly different expectations about trends in fossil diversity, and evolution is strongly supported while creationism is not.

TI Effects of Phylogenetic Tree Style on Student Comprehension in an
   Introductory Biology Course
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE phylogenetic trees; tree thinking; evolution; introductory biology
ID COLLEGE-STUDENTS; THINKING; EVOLUTION
AB Phylogenetic trees have become an important component of biology education, but their utility in the classroom is compromised by widespread misinterpretations among students. One factor that may contribute to student difficulties is style, as diagonal and bracket phylogenetic trees are both commonly used in biology. Previous research using surveys found that students performed better with bracket phylogenetic trees across a variety of interpretation tasks. The present study builds on prior research by comparing how students interpret diagonal and bracket phylogenetic trees in the context of an introductory biology course and by expanding the style comparison to include construction tasks. Students performed significantly better with bracket phylogenetic trees for some, but not all, interpretation tasks. In addition, students who constructed bracket phylogenetic trees were significantly more accurate compared to those who used the diagonal style. Thus, our results reinforce previous research for interpretations, and the performance gap between styles extended to construction tasks. It remains to be seen, however, if such differences persist after instruction that balances the use of diagonal and bracket phylogenetic trees.

TI Beyond Reflection: Using ePortfolios for Formative Assessment to Improve
   Student Engagement in Non-Majors Introductory Science

ID LEARNING PORTFOLIOS; FEEDBACK; PERFORMANCE; PRINCIPLES; QUESTION; MODEL
AB Success rates in non-majors introductory biology courses tend to be lower than those in courses for majors. The use of student learning ePortfolios correlates with increased retention and improved learning. Additionally, when ePortfolios are used for periodic formative assessment, they have been shown to stimulate student response to feedback and improve the quality of student work-both indicators of increased student engagement. In our study, the implementation of low-stake assignments in ePortfolio fostered a dialogue between the instructor and student outside of class time and provided opportunities for formative assessment of individual student and overall class learning prior to larger, high-stakes summative assessments. Furthermore, ePortfolio allowed the instructor to give students feedback on their work, creating opportunities for confirmation of learning or extended learning outside of class. Through intentional and embedded use of ePortfolios, we have created a learning environment that fosters more interaction with course material outside of class, better assignment turn-in rates, and improved exam scores, for increased success rates in the course. These results describe a promising intervention that can improve success rates in introductory biology courses.

AB Attempting to foster mastery learning for students in the biological sciences, we incorporated an authentic research-based activity that contained real-world applications. To do this, we redesigned a laboratory component of a junior level, general genetics course. This included lengthening the time for the experiment, incorporating new technology for data analyses, and generating new assessments. These changes led to a more collaborative and interactive environment. Students were given the challenge of inducing a phenotypic change within the model organism, Paramecium. This allowed students to design their own experimental approaches. We assessed the students on formative and summative levels to determine if they were accomplishing the learning outcomes. Students demonstrated they were successful in meeting these, which included mastering a set of laboratory skills, designing their own experiment, and incorporating technology needed for data collection and analyses.

DE Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; populations; genetics
AB In an earlier paper (Smith & Baldwin, 2015), we explained the basic concepts of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWeq) principle needed for meaningful understanding and for good teaching, emphasizing distinctions that are sometimes ignored at the cost of coherent understanding, and identifying nine shortcomings of most available Hardy-Weinberg activities and problem sets. In the present paper, we provide a 5E lesson plan based on that analysis and designed to avoid the shortcomings identified, including providing original data and focusing on understanding and topics that are interesting and meaningful to young people.

AB Processes of diffusion of oxygen can be described in a formalized and simplified manner in formulas such as Fick's laws of diffusion. For a sound understanding of the interconnections of anatomical structure, biological function, and environmental factors in a living system, however, real-life case studies need to be employed to explore what is captured in the equation and what is not, and which other structures and behaviors may play a role in respiratory physiology. I use four anuran examples to illustrate, starting with Fick's first law, respiratory processes as influenced by surface-area-to-volume ratio and turbulence in the surrounding medium.

AB Students in the United States struggle with literacy skills, a problem that extends into their undergraduate education and beyond. Particularly in the sciences, reading assignments are usually singularly academic in nature and do not impart the importance of creativity and innovation. We propose a curriculum strategy and lesson plan that employs a "reading across the curriculum" approach to enhance literacy skills in biology students while simultaneously encouraging scientific discourse and creativity.

AB Understanding habitat heterogeneity and habitat preference are central tenets of undergraduate ecology courses, but many urban campuses, particularly community colleges and others with large student enrollments, may lack the means for extensive field sampling and monitoring. We outline the use of diatoms living in decorative water fountains as a proxy for field sample collection, data analysis, and ecological interpretation. These methods are amenable to undergraduate laboratory courses and independent student research projects.

ID HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS
AB This lesson is designed to facilitate student understanding of the molecular structure of DNA, the cellular processes involved in DNA replication, and how these principles were applied to develop a method to determine the nucleotide sequence of DNA. The lesson employs an active and cooperative learning approach accomplished via a modified jigsaw exercise. The specific replication/sequencing process in this lesson is Sanger's dideoxy method of DNA sequencing. In conjunction with related lessons in lecture and lab, students read the relevant section of an appropriate introductory biology textbook and/or view videos explaining how Sanger's dideoxy chain-termination sequencing method works. Students working in four teams (A, C, G, and T) then use green, blue, brown, and red M&M's as nucleotides to build a model of the process. Plain M&M's represent deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), while peanut M&M's represent the "terminator" dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs). The lesson addresses Next Generation Science Standards and learning goals typically found in college biology courses at introductory and advanced levels.

AB The AAAS "Vision and Change" report (2011) has been inspiring undergraduate biology educators nationwide to rethink their educational approach, favoring active-learning strategies to better prepare today's students for a complex, data-rich future. Here, we consider the history of the movement, its place in the greater arena of STEM education, and the reasons why this new approach has never been more critical. We encourage all biology educators to consider becoming agents of change, and we focus on helpful resources and practical suggestions to help ABT readers take the plunge into (or at least get their feet wet in) the welcoming waters of Vision and Change.

AB We respond to the preceding commentary (Brower, 2016) regarding our "Inquiry & Investigation" articles (Davenport et al., 2015a, b) published recently in this journal. Our two articles describe a pair of activities, informed by biology education literature and national standards documents, whose primary goal is to help teachers assist introductory students in evaluating basic evolutionary datasets. In this short response to Brower's critique, we acknowledge that our activities, which address the complex field of systematics, contain simplifications and inaccuracies. At the same time, we hold that the activities are grounded in careful pedagogical decisions that allow students in general biology courses to readily understand major features of phylogenetic trees. We also argue that the design of the activities allows students to experience first hand a vital component of the nature of science: prioritizing data when formulating a claim.

ID VIEWS
AB The National Research Council's Framework for K-12 Science Education and the resulting Next Generation Science Standards call for engaging students in the practices of science to develop scientific literacy. While these documents make the connections between scientific knowledge and practices explicit, very little attention is given to the shared values and commitments of the scientific community that underlie these practices and give them meaning. I argue that effective science education should engage students in the practices of science while also reflecting on the values, commitments, and habits of mind that have led to the practices of modern science and that give them meaning. The concept of methodological naturalism demonstrates the connection between the values and commitments of the culture of science and its practices and provides a useful lens for understanding the benefits and limitations of scientific knowledge.

AB K-12 science programs in the United States are implementing inquiry-based lessons to expose students to the scientific process, and in some states these changes are mandated by regulations. At the same time, university faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines are being encouraged by agencies funding their research to develop outreach activities that typically involve schools. Outreach programs promoting interactions between schools and universities are one means to address this need, and here we describe such a program between a Los Angeles independent school and California State University, Northridge. Our program exploits experiential learning focused on marine biology to engage students in ecological research with application to contemporary environmental issues such as climate change. Moreover, it addresses multiple aspects of the Next Generation Science Standards within a flexible framework that can be adapted to multiple curricular needs. Coral reefs are used as a model system in this program, but the concepts can easily be extended to other coastal marine environments. The program has evolved through three phases: (1) fostering interactions among educational partners, and developing curricula through research that exploits problem-solving skills; (2) completion of scientific activities in the classroom and field; and (3) engaging students in the scientific process through professional conferences and publication. These efforts have led to a self-sustaining program of interactions among schoolchildren, undergraduates, graduate students, K-12 educators, and university faculty that is promoting STEM careers and generating peer-reviewed publications.

ID MIGRATORY SONGBIRDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FECUNDITY; BIRDS
AB A major goal of ecological research is to understand how ecological factors, such as food and predator abundance, interact to shape birth and death rates. Case studies describing this research can provide students with an understanding of how ecological conditions affect demographic rates, as well as an opportunity to explore and interpret real data. We have developed a Web-based teaching module based on a long-term study of a migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). The website describes this species and the ecological factors that affect its population growth and provides three exercises developed to span a range of student levels.

AB When describing biogeochemical transfers, textbook authors have often overstated the role of soil while neglecting the role of carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, these errors align with naive biogeochemical intuitions. This article aims to increase awareness of the prevalence of such misconceptions and offers countermeasures. Avoiding these misconceptions becomes increasingly important as concerns over carbon emissions grow. In addition, because an accurate understanding of biogeochemical cycles can transform deeply held beliefs, successfully teaching this topic can have the collateral benefit of inspiring lasting interest in science.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE DNA fingerprint; forensics; RFLP; Harry Potter
AB This lesson uses characters from the Harry Potter series of novels as a "hook" to stimulate students' interest in introductory forensic science. Students are guided through RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis using inexpensive materials and asked to interpret data from a mock crime scene. Importantly, the lesson provides an opportunity to discuss limitations of using DNA fingerprinting for forensic purposes and addresses a common misconception that the sophisticated science involved in crime-scene analysis is infallible.

AB This is a set of animal behavior investigations in which students will practice scientific inquiry as they observe crayfish, ask questions, and discuss territoriality, social interactions, and other behaviors. In doing this, they hone their skills of observation, learn to record and analyze data, control for variables, write hypotheses, make tentative conclusions, and then design and carry out original experiments. This set of activities and experiments is designed for middle school through high school life science or biology classrooms.

TI Using a 17th-Century Experiment as a Gateway to Critical Assessment of
   Scientific Reports
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Scientific reports; critical analysis; biology teaching
AB It is certainly widely appreciated that there is much to be gained in the fertile crosstalk between science and history - whether bringing a historical perspective into the science classroom (Wieder, 2006) or a scientific perspective to the study of history (McElvaine, 2002; Smail, 2008). Perhaps the major impetus for using history in teaching science has been to better transmit a sense of how science actually gets done (Conant, 1948; Johnson, 1996). I describe a different approach: using historical materials not from a history-of-science perspective but in actively developing students' analytical abilities with respect to scientific experiment and current scientific reports.

AB National science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education emphasizes science practices, such as hands-on learning. We describe a week-long activity where students participate in real-world scientific discovery, including "hunting" for bacteriophage in a variety of environmental samples. First, the students collect samples, then look for evidence of phage on "bait" bacteria, and finally amplify/purify the phages for further study.

ID ACADEMIC LANGUAGE; TERMINOLOGY; INSTRUCTION; LEARNERS; STUDENTS; ANATOMY
AB In all fields of biology, understanding technical terminology is a challenge for students. In many cases, this may distract them from focusing on fundamental processes and concepts. Across the biology subfields, much of the vernacular shares similar etymology and morphology. However, students lack the exposure necessary to identify these key features, which often explain the meaning of terms without requiring any context at all. Therefore, instead of encouraging students to memorize many terms independently, it could be more beneficial to show them how words are constructed. Here, I propose an activity designed to help students recognize terms that may be connected, understand how vocabulary is often constructed to reflect its idea, and develop comfortability using these terms themselves in discussions. Through a guided group activity, students will have a chance to break down terms they have previously encountered and to draw connections between novel words. If students are capable of relating words to each other before even knowing what they mean, they may learn more effectively. Without being intimidated by enigmatic vocabulary, they can focus on broader concepts. In addition, when students understand how biological terminology is constructed, they may even dissect new words without needing the context surrounding them. This activity is applicable to courses in any specialty of biology, as various molecules, tissues, and processes follow general naming principles.

AB Molecular cloning is an invaluable research tool in modern molecular biology. However, it is often difficult for students to grasp conceptually without visual aids and even more difficult to understand how to successfully set up a cloning experiment. Here, we describe a flipped classroom activity that simulates cloning using donuts as models of plasmids. Students noted in semistructured interviews that the interactive nature of this activity made it an engaging introduction to molecular cloning.

ID APOLIPOPROTEIN-E
AB Understanding the structural and functional relationships of proteins is an important concept of biology. Therefore, we had Gordon State College students in the biochemistry class of spring 2019 apply and evaluate a hands-on bioinformatics activity, using the free bioinformatics program, RasMol. This module was designed to help students understand the relationships of a protein to a specific disease, and in this paper, we have chosen to discuss apolipoprotein E (APOE) relationships to Alzheimer's disease since some of the students had an interest in neurobiochemistry.
   During the learning module, students were asked to identify structural differences among the APOE isoforms. Overall, 20 out of 27 students (74.1%) evaluated the instructional value of the RasMol program positively after being surveyed. Student feedback also suggested they learned more about the molecular structure of APOE using RasMol. Therefore, utilization of free computer bioinformatics activities encourages students to apply logical, real-world solutions to biological problems.

TI Making Sense of Monarchs: Toward Linking Phenomena & Scientific
   Argumentation with Cultural Relevance
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE culturally relevant science teaching; inquiry; monarch butterfly;
   phenomena; scientific argumentation
ID BUTTERFLIES; CYCLE
AB We use the population decline of the monarch butterfly as a central phenomenon to support data analysis and scientific argumentation skills and to motivate inquiry and content learning in intermediate college-level biology courses. Students practice analyzing population trends, critically evaluate scientific articles that debate the causes and implications of those trends, and interpret data using key biological concepts in evolution and ecology. Students learn how to evaluate and reconcile conflicting information and use evidence and scientific reasoning to develop arguments about how communities should respond to the decline. Many of our students find the phenomenon engaging, probably because many of them come from the Upper Midwest and have witnessed or even reared monarch butterflies at home or in previous schooling. However, we draw upon ideas from culturally relevant science teaching to engage more of our students in critical analysis about the relevance of these topics to their communities, and we propose strategies for teaching about the monarch decline phenomenon in diverse contexts.

DE science communication; media literacy; credibilty; expertise
AB Science denial, misinformation, and science con-artists are on the rise. We are plagued by anti-vaxxers, climate change naysayers, and promoters of ineffective fad diets and medical cures. The scientifically literate citizen or consumer needs skills in differentiating good science and trustworthy sources from impostors. Here, I present a series of student-centered activities that help students inquire into the nature of credibility and the problems of expertise, mediated knowledge, and science communication. I open with a playful guessing game about "fantastic beasts" reported in the 16th century, then follow with more modern examples. I then describe a science version of "To Tell the Truth," a reflective exercise on "Finding the Expert," and then a student opportunity to explore deceptive strategies by trying to bluff their classmates with false news stories about science. These all develop basic concepts in science media literacy and prepare students for more serious investigation into a contemporary scientific controversy.

TI Assessing the Effectiveness of a Novel Microscopy Technique in Middle &

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE transmission-through-dye; TTD microscopy; inquiry
AB Although research and new technologies have introduced different ways of observing microorganisms, including scanning and electron microscopy, these methods are expensive and require equipment that is typically not found in a middle school classroom. The transmission-through-dye technique (TTD; Gregg et al., 2010), a new optical microscopy method that can be used with current basic light microscopes, relies on the fairly simple mechanism of filtered light passing through a dyed medium to produce an image that reflects cell thickness. With this technique, living microorganisms look bright red against a dark background, and movement can be seen easily among dead microorganisms and debris that show up black. Since the technique is low-cost and easy to implement, it addresses the needs of practitioners and is appropriate for a wide array of school contexts. We describe a three-week, hands-on, inquiry-based unit on TTD microscopy for middle and high school students.

AB Students often bring to biology classrooms ideas that are not in line with scientific thought. Simply telling students that their ideas are wrong does not always help advance their scientific thinking. This article describes a teaching and learning activity that allows secondary biology teachers to elicit, interpret, and address students' misconceptions in a meaningful way. The activity provides a chance for students to discuss their nascent ideas about biology with their peers in a safe and nonthreatening environment. More importantly, the activity engages students in a process of reconsidering their initial ideas through reasoning about why certain ideas are scientifically correct.

AB The processes of mitosis and meiosis are oft-cited and long-standing examples of concepts that are difficult for students to learn and understand. While there are many examples in the literature of "how-to-do-it," innovative instructional approaches for teaching mitosis and meiosis, publications that include measurement of learning gains are fewer. Moreover, when measurement of learning gains are reported, the outcomes of innovative approaches are most often compared to outcomes from traditional lecture format instruction. In contrast, this research compares two active-learning approaches to teaching meiosis through modeling in an introductory undergraduate biology course for health sciences majors. Items from the published, validated Meiosis Concept Inventory were used for pre- and post-instruction assessment. In addition, we collected data regarding student perceptions of the learning experience in each modeling scenario through two Likert-scale items and two free-response items. Overall, students demonstrated significant learning gains from pre- to post-assessment. We found no significant differences in performance on the posttest between the two modeling approaches, indicating that the selection of the modeling activity used to support student learning can be made on the basis of other criteria, such as instructor preference, physical classroom layout, or available supplies.

TI Teaching Race (Bioculturally) Matters: A Visual Approach for College
   Biology Courses
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

ID SCIENCE; STUDENTS; WOMEN; CONCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; RACISM; BIRTH
AB Race and racism are considered standard subject matter in introductory college courses in the social sciences, but remain relatively absent in biological science courses (Donovan, 2015; Morning, 2011). Given a resurgence of biologically deterministic racial science (e.g., Risch et al., 2002; Shiao et al., 2012) and ongoing racial tensions in the United States, it is imperative that biology professors actively engage students in introductory and upper-level courses. This paper presents a tested approach used in an introductory natural science course (for undergraduate, non-science majors) at a mid-sized regional university. A biocultural focus is advocated for teaching about the fallacies (i.e., biological race concept) and realities of race (i.e., racism) (e.g., see Gravlee, 2009; Thompson, 2006). Further, an emphasis is placed on using a visual approach for relaying these complex and sensitive topics.

TI Impact of a Short Evolution Module on Students' Perceived Conflict
   between Religion and Evolution
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English

DE evolution; attitudes; religion; acceptance of evolution; curriculum
ID BELIEFS
AB Evolution has historically been a topic in biology that is fraught with controversy, and a conflict between religion and evolution is often assumed. If students perceive that evolution is in conflict with their religious beliefs, it can have negative ramifications for their learning of evolution and attitudes toward science. However, religion and evolution have been argued to be compatible. An instructor can incorporate a discussion of this compatibility into their teaching, but the impact of this on students' perceptions of compatibility is still unknown. In this study, we describe a two-week module on evolution with embedded discussion about compatibility between religion and evolution. We surveyed introductory biology students before and after this evolution module about whether they thought evolution and religion could be compatible. We found that the evolution module reduced the number of students who perceived a conflict between evolution and religion by 50 percent. Unexpectedly, perceived conflict between religion and evolution was reduced for both religious and nonreligious students. These results indicate that how instructors present a module on evolution can have an impact on student perceptions of compatibility between religion and evolution.

TI Sexual Selection: A Short Review on Its Causes and Outcomes, and

AB Sexual selection plays an important role in species evolution and speciation, and is fundamental to understanding of biological evolution. In the last decades, research on sexual selection helped understand its causes and impacts in species evolution, sexual dimorphism, and speciation. It also provided interesting examples that can be used to engage students in learning about evolution. Here we review the latest sexual selection research and propose two activities that model evolution by sexual selection. The engaging nature of these activities makes them useful to promote active learning about evolution, the nature of science, and methods used to construct scientific knowledge. Importantly, we address several performance expectations suggested by the Next Generation Science Standards.

DE Award; classroom; microbiology; student motivation; Petri dish
AB Student motivation in class is extremely important because it may lead to a successful learning experience, followed by academic accomplishment. As a strategy to motivate undergraduate students in a microbiology course, we established an awards system named the "Gold, Silver, and Bronze Petri Dish Awards in Microbiology." The awards system was either offered or not to a group of students (N = 34 for both cohorts). Students who had the opportunity to receive an award obtained higher grades than those for whom the awards system was not implemented (P<0.01). Course evaluations for the teachers who used the awards system were also higher. The awards system fostered learning of microbiology by undergraduate students.

AB Building evolutionary trees can be an excellent way for students to see how different gene sequences or organisms are related to one another. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software is a free package that lets anyone build evolutionary trees in a user-friendly setup. There are several options to choose from when building trees from molecular data in MEGA, but the most commonly used are neighbor joining and maximum likelihood, both of which give good estimates on the relationship between different molecular sequences. In this article, we describe how to collect data from GenBank, insert the data into a text editor, import the data into MEGA, and use the dataset to create phylogenetic trees.

AB We describe a multiweek laboratory exercise that engages students in class-based research related to sexual reproduction, selection, orientation, and operational sex ratios. Specifically, students discuss contemporary research on sex in the bean beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, and then develop and test hypotheses related to bean beetle sex. Working with bean beetles is inexpensive and logistically manageable, allowing instructors to scale up to large-enrollment courses. In addition, live organisms engage students in meaningful dialogue related to evolution, sex, and the process of science itself.

TI Addressing the Problem of Poorly Preserved Zoological Specimens: A Case
   Study with Turtles
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Anatomy; herpetology; sigmoid flexure; Pleurodira; Cryptodira; turtle
AB We present a new use for a poorly preserved turtle specimen that teachers can easily use in demonstrating vertebrate anatomy or adaptive herpetology at the high school or college level. We give special attention to illustrating the sigmoid flexure of the neck as certain turtles withdraw their heads. This ability is anatomically and biologically important in that it protects the turtle from predators and is one of the major anatomical radiations that occurred in turtle evolution. The lesson also demonstrates how turtles, whose anatomy is confined within a rigid compartment, have their organs arranged and how adaptive strategies overcome this spatial constraint.

DE Science literacy; undergraduate; biology for nonmajors; topic-centered
   learning; course design; human biology
AB We designed a human biology course that interests nonmajors while improving science literacy through student engagement, using a constructivist-inspired, topic-centered approach. This way of learning highlights common diseases that provide a basis to incorporate specific biological concepts. The topic-centered approach triggers interest and increases positive perceptions of learning science, and students find applicability in what they learn. In alignment with the Vision and Change report of AAAS, this course addresses the need to focus on connecting biology principles with real-world concerns, while incorporating students' experiences into the learning process.

DE Heart valve; model; active learning
AB Heart valves play a vital role in efficient circulation of the blood, and the details of their physical structure are related crucially to their function. However, it can be challenging for the learner to make the mental connection between anatomical structures of valves and the changing pressure gradients that the valves experience and come to an understanding of valve function. Making your own simple, inexpensive working models allows your students to visualize valve action quickly and easily, and to predict effects on function if valve structure were altered. A link to a video showing use and construction of the working valve models is given.

AB To involve students in thinking about the problem of AIDS (which is important in the view of nondecreasing infection rates), we established a practical lab using a simplified adaptation of Thomas's (2004) method to determine the polymorphism of HIV co-receptor CCR5 from students' own epithelial cells. CCR5 is a receptor involved in inflammatory processes, which has been misused by some pathogens, including HIV, to enter host cells. As a result, a defective allele CCR5-Delta 32 has been enriched in some populations. The interesting story and hands-on work with their own tissue absorbed students in this 2-hour practical.

AB Microscopy and precise observation are essential skills that are challenging to teach effectively to large numbers of undergraduate biology students. We implemented student-driven digital imaging assignments for microscopy in a largeenrollment laboratory for organismal biology. We detail how we promoted student engagement with the material and how we assessed student learning in both formative and summative formats using digital images. Students worked in pairs to collect over 60 digital images of their microscopic observations over the semester and then individually created electronic portfolios, which were submitted for a grade.

ID POPULATION-GENETICS; MISCONCEPTIONS; CREATIONISM; ACCEPTANCE
AB Teaching population genetics provides a bridge between genetics and evolution by using examples of the mechanisms that underlie changes in allele frequencies over time. Existing methods of teaching these concepts often rely on computer simulations or hand calculations, which distract students from the material and are problematic for those with high math anxiety. We outline an exercise that engages students and provides real-time feedback through the use of classroom response devices. This exercise has been used with success and employs a conceptual-change approach to teach the fundamental, yet often misunderstood, concept of biological evolution.

TI A (1)-(2)-(3) Jumpstart Approach to Answer an Open-Ended Question
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Guided reflection; guided questions; introductory sentences; question's
   objective; organizing skills
AB I propose three guided questions for reflection as a jumpstart organizational formula for students with poor writing application skills to follow when responding to an open-ended question. The recipe prescribes that the student (1) understand the question design, (2) identify the intent or objective of the question, and (3) proceed to identify the key words or phrases that are relevant to answer the question. The three prompts serve as a "getting started" writing template for students to organize their thoughts and then compose the introductory sentences of their answer. The identified significant words and phrases should then be further explained and clarified by the student to complete the main body of the response. In addition, these opening sentences serve as an index at the outset of the response for a teacher to gauge the student's understanding of and approach toward answering the question.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Evolution; religion; high school biology
ID MATTER; CREATIONISM
AB We examined how college students' knowledge of evolution is associated with their self-described religious beliefs and the evolution-related content of their high school biology courses. On average, students entering college know little about evolution. Religious beliefs, the absence of evolution-related instruction in high school, and the presence of creationism-related instruction in high school were all associated with significantly lower scores on an evolution exam. We present an ordered logistic model that helps to explain (1) students' diverse views and knowledge of evolution, and (2) why college-level instruction about evolution often fails to significantly affect students' views about evolution.

TI A Better Way to Teach Basic Microscopy, Using the Organisms Found in
   "Fish Poop"
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Microscopy; microorganism
AB Basic microscopy is frequently taught using prepared specimens and monocultures of ciliates. I suggest that using "fish poop" to teach microscopy not only accomplishes the same goals as traditional methods but is also advantageous because (1) students become excited about finding novel organisms, (2) it offers many links to other material covered in the course (e. g., ecosystems, niches, and phylogenetics), (3) it is adaptable to student skill level, and (4) it is free. Once the basic procedure is established, a biology teacher can easily modify the microscopy lab to meet their specific needs.

AB While educationally beneficial, place-based learning can be challenging to implement in an applied forest ecology course that draws a diversity of students with limited forest experience. I describe a semester-long sequence of labs designed to instill place-based learning principles. The semester begins with an observational lab to develop an initial personal forest relationship, with future learning reinforcing and cultivating this bond. Forest-specific labs cover key applied ecology concepts while continuing to expand on students' place knowledge with an overarching forest management plan to provide real-world application and expression of understanding.

AB Plastic debris in aquatic and marine environments often breaks up into fragments that are smaller than 5 millimeters, which are then classified as microplastics. While there is not yet a standardized and validated methodology for characterizing microplastics, the protocol developed in this study uses methods for isolating and observing microplastics and for the investigation of how they interact with organisms present in biofilms from urban waterways. Project-based learning (PBL) has been proven to be a successful strategy in K-12 science education; the implementation of PBL provides opportunities for student-driven inquiry and provides teachers with a means to integrate curriculum with current research and to consider the effects of human impacts on the environment. This paper describes the protocol developed for high school teachers to educate students about microplastics and how to successfully isolate and observe them. Teachers and students in Maryland successfully isolated microplastics from biofilm samples from the Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland, and shared their results. International teachers and students in Barcelona, Spain, involved in a related project, had similar results and shared experiences through images, video, and online meetings. These collaborations provide important opportunities for student-driven inquiry and for them to engage in methods of current scientific research.

AB The issue of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is often misunderstood. Here, we present an activity that debunks misconceptions regarding microorganisms, such as bacterial pathogens, and addresses how antibiotics work. We propose this activity be incorporated into middle or high school classrooms addressing both this real-world issue and elements from the Next Generation Science Standards. Students are encouraged to use hands-on experiences toward hypothesis development and testing to better understand how antibiotic resistance is spread among bacterial pathogens and commensals. Over half of the students who participated in this activity self-reported that they were likely to share the information they learned outside of their classroom, reflecting real-time impacts on science stewardship in students. This activity also presents students with an issue that has clear action items they can undertake to effect positive change.

AB Teaching and understanding evolution is challenging because students must synthesize several biological processes that are traditionally taught separately. We developed a set of free online lessons and activities centered on a single evolutionary phenomenon - why deer mice have different fur colors in different subpopulations - to help high school students better understand how these different biological processes, operating at different scales, work together to influence a single organismal trait. Through scaffolded investigations, guiding questions, model building, and pointed analysis, students learn how ecology, cellular biology, molecular biology, genetic inheritance, and population genetics all work together to influence a shift in fur color over time. Using an innovative multilevel simulation, students manipulate and examine these different processes from the population level all the way down to the DNA level. In this article, we describe the lessons and materials we have developed for high school biology students. We outline the learning goals and highlight the major components of the technology and activities in each lesson. We then provide information on how to access our curricular and support materials, and conclude with user feedback from our pilot testing.

AB Reliable scientific conclusions are based on verifiable empirical evidence. But data must be transformed and interpreted before they become evidence, and statistical inference plays an important role in the process of interpretation. Biologists use statistics to organize and analyze data so that they can make inferences and use the data as evidence. Students should have opportunities to collect and analyze data in their biology classes as well. In this activity, students collect data on the surface areas of sun leaves and shade leaves, then analyze the data using the independent-samples t-test. The t-test procedure can be used in investigations where two groups are compared on one dependent variable.

AB The study of mammals that hibernate provides a unique avenue for students to explore the concepts of metabolism, bone structure, and the impact of climate change on mammals with evolutionary adaptations to extreme seasonal changes in food supply. "Secrets of the Hibernators" is a student-centered, self-guided kit developed by educators in close collaboration with biologists studying the physiology of hibernating animals. The kit uses a hands-on, inquiry-based approach, providing students access to research data that they can easily analyze and interpret, as well as an experimental model for exploring how temperature can affect metabolism. Students learn how the study of hibernators may provide clues to help find solutions to human diseases such as obesity and osteoporosis.

TI Adding CURE to Traditional Labs: Hands-On Microplastics Research in
   Freshwater Systems Conducted by First-Year Biology Students
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Great Plains; Kansas; pedagogy; course-based undergraduate research
   experience
AB This project involves students in a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) as part of the traditional introductory biology laboratory course. Recently, research has shown that student engagement in authentic research has significant positive impacts on students, such as development of science literacy and reasoning skills. Being recently featured in the news, microplastics are a timely, interesting, and relevant topic for students. The authentic research conducted by students was the first attempt at quantification of microplastics in the Great Plains, which garnered further student excitement and engagement. Surface water and substrate samples were collected at 23 locations from small streams, rivers, ponds, and reservoirs in fall 2018. Authentic research, as broadly defined in the pedagogical context, is research conducted primarily by students. In the context of this project, authentic research is specifically defined as research done primarily by students in which the students are asking questions, designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and writing a final manuscript that was submitted, and accepted, as a peer-reviewed publication. This project could be incorporated at the high school or university level, for biology major or nonmajor courses. The purpose of this paper is to serve as a how-to, sharing the lesson design with specific detail on student responsibilities.

   Learning Tapping into Adolescents' Interests
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Music; seed germination; project-based learning; indigenous knowledge;
   affective domain
ID SEED; STRESS
AB Science education often fails to address the actual range of adolescents' interests. One such interest is music. Research shows that young people devote large amounts of time and money to music. By tapping into students' interest in music, affective outcomes can be achieved in the biology classroom. This article describes a project-based learning activity that studies the influence of music on seed germination. Part of the student project is to conduct a literature search on the influence of music on plants, and possibly also on people (its biological, psychological, and social effects). The project is contextualized in the indigenous practice of making music while planting crops. There is a growing body of literature suggesting that music can improve crop yields. Students are required to follow the key features of project-based learning to plan and execute an inquiry to determine the influence of music on seed germination. Students undertaking a literature study will find research showing that music affects the viscosity of the plasmalemma and the availability of intercellular Ca2+, which, in turn, influences the activity of membrane-based enzymes. This can lead to larger amounts of water, nutrients, and growth regulators entering the plant cell. The article also reflects on data obtained from high school biology students as they engage in the learning activity.

DT Article
DE Seminar; research talk; research articles; scientific literacy
AB Although guest speakers have been a part of our curriculum for several decades, in recent years we have adopted a system that allows us to maximize the benefit of these speakers for our students. We provide learning opportunities before, during, and after a seminar to enhance students' scientific comprehension. Our system begins with students reading peer-reviewed literature relevant to a future seminar. In class, students work cooperatively to answer guided questions about the article, which serves as a basis for a discussion of the article among the entire class. This preparation facilitates students' understanding, their engagement, and their awareness of effective presentation techniques. Finally, small-group discussions with the speaker can provide students knowledge about their curriculum, awareness of additional opportunities, and insight into the nature of science. Our system thus provides a series of learning opportunities that ensure student engagement with the material multiple times, resulting in a deeper understanding of scientific research and effective mechanisms to communicate it.

AB An introductory cell biology laboratory course was redesigned using two inquiry-based modules to align with the goals of scientific inquiry as described in Vision and Change. To evaluate the lab's efficacy, we used a broad range of materials, including pretests and posttests, online surveys, focus group interviews, and course evaluations. Although our students produced significant learning gains on technical laboratory skills, methods, and data analyses, during the first two years their affective dispositions toward the experience were more negative. By evaluating our class data in light of insights from the scholarship of teaching and learning, we were able to provide better guidance to students and subsequently to persist past this implementation dip, showing continued positive gains in student learning outcomes, and eliminating the negative impact on student affective outcomes. Our experience underscores the value of scientific teaching, using class data and evidence-based practices to persist beyond the implementation dips that come with adopting new curricula.

ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH
AB To enhance/update our microbiology course, we employed a geographic information science and technology (GIST) infusion to improve students' understanding of epidemiology and disease spread and to encourage students to earn a GIST certificate, making them more marketable in an increasingly competitive workplace. Following a 25-minute introductory GIST infusion lecture during a microbiology class session, a 1.5-hour GIST laboratory exercise was performed in which teams of students evaluated Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chlamydial disease incidence data. In addition to answering three quiz questions addressing the data, students created a map, using ArcGIS software, indicating which Texas counties experienced the highest rates of chlamydia in 2014. To determine the efficacy/value of our infusion, GIST survey data (pre- and post-infusion), GIST lab quiz scores, and answers to four GIST lecture exam questions were evaluated. In conclusion, our study was successful in improving understanding of what GIST is and how it could impact biological fields by improving attitudes about the likelihood of further GIST study leading to a certificate program, and by exposing biology undergraduates to GIST technologies and software, enabling student data mapping. Ultimately, our efforts could promote enhanced vocationalization of our biology program, thereby enhancing and broadening employment opportunities for our graduates.

AB This lesson presents an interrupted case study based on the true story of the 2002 murder of Christa Worthington in Massachusetts. The case was developed for use in an undergraduate non- majors life science course, but would also be appropriate for a high school biology course or a forensic science course. During this lesson, students examine a crime scene diagram and discuss evidence collection. Students then conduct a hands-on activity extracting DNA from wheat germ to simulate how DNA would be isolated from crime scene samples. Lastly the students will analyze simulated DNA profiles produced using STRs, polymerase chain reaction, and gel electrophoresis to help match a crime scene sample to one of five suspects. The pros and cons surrounding the use of a DNA dragnet are also discussed.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Data; evolution; nature of science; biology; research projects;
   journals; inquiry; literacy
AB Biology is often taught as disconnected facts, even though the subject itself provides a holistic approach to the study of life, particularly through the overarching frame of evolution. The Framework for K-12 Science Education and Next Generation Science Standards promote a coherent approach to science that uses a developmental approach to learning. This is consistent with the use of data, reflective strategies, and a research inquiry approach that encourages students to confront their own thinking and reasoning, and thus encourages the engagement of argumentation in the classroom. This article presents narratives and classroom scenarios that might provide insights into learning strategies, with implications for a more cohesive approach to learning both biology concepts and the practices of science.

ID LESSONS
AB First reported in March 2014, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has now claimed more lives than all other known EVD outbreaks combined, making it the deadliest occurrence of the disease since it was first discovered nearly 40 years ago. In hopes of turning the outbreak into something positive from an educational standpoint, a module was developed focusing on EVD, infectious disease, and epidemiology. The module engages students in a series of inquiry-based lessons, providing accurate and up-to-date information on the current outbreak of EVD in West Africa. The lessons also serve to correct popular misconceptions about the disease. The lessons include a jigsaw WebQuest using resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a simulation based on fluid exchange to model the spread of an outbreak of infectious disease, and a "disease detective"-style mapping activity based on published data outlining the start of the current EVD outbreak in Guinea.

TI Deriving Population Growth Models by Growing Fruit Fly Colonies

DE Population growth; mathematical reasoning; inquiry
ID UNDERGRADUATE BIOLOGY; QUANTITATIVE SKILLS; MATHEMATICS; EDUCATION;

AB Population growth presents a unique opportunity to make the connection between mathematical and biological reasoning. The objective of this article is to introduce a method of teaching population growth that allows students to utilize mathematical reasoning to derive population growth models from authentic populations through active learning and firsthand experiences. To accomplish this, we designed a lab in which students grow and count populations of Drosophila over the course of 12 weeks, modifying abiotic and biotic limiting factors. Using the data, students derive exponential and logistic growth equations, through mathematical reasoning patterns that allow them to understand the purpose of these models, and hypothesize relationships between various factors and population growth. We gathered student attitudinal data and found that students perceived the lab as more effective, better at preparing them for lecture, and more engaging than the previous lab used. Through this active and inquiry-based method of teaching, students are more involved and engaged in both mathematical and biological reasoning processes.

AB This activity provides students an interactive demonstration of the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis during aerobic respiration. Students use simple, everyday objects as hydrogen ions and electrons and play the roles of the various proteins embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane to show how this specific process in cellular respiration produces ATP. The activity works best as a supplement after you have already discussed the electron transport chain in lecture but can be used prior to instruction to help students visualize the processes that occur. This demonstration was designed for general college biology for majors at a community college, but it could be used in any introductory college-level or advanced placement biology course.

DT Article
DE Aliens; science fiction; animals; taxonomy; evolution
ID SCIENCE-FICTION
AB Creatures from science fiction and fantasy can be used to illustrate key concepts and principles in biology. This article describes a project for a university-level general zoology course wherein the students classify, down to at least the phylum level, "animals" from the Alien Species Wiki (2013). This is an online database of creatures from television, film, literature, and games. The primary challenges that the students faced were overly fantastical hybridizations and assigning reality-based classification mechanisms to fictional beings, but the project is a useful exercise in creativity, knowledge of diagnostic characteristics, and the wonder of discovery of new, previously unexplainable physio-morphologies.

AB The growth of pollen tubes is one of the most characteristic events in angiosperm reproduction. This article describes an activity for visualizing the journey and guidance of pollen tubes in the reproductive structures of a flowering plant. The activity uses a semi-in vivo system with rapid-cycling Brassica rapa, also known as Fast Plants. Isolated ovules were used to attract pollen tubes that were triggered to grow through explants of female flower parts. The activity provides insight into the in vivo situation of plant reproduction, appealing visual results, and the development of science process skills.

DE Herbivory; specialists; generalists; caterpillars; scientific method
AB National science standards require an understanding of animal behavior, diversity, and adaptations of organisms, as well as the concept of science as inquiry. We have developed a hands-on classroom activity that addresses these standards through teaching about herbivory and diet breadth, using locally abundant caterpillars and plants. This activity provides students with opportunities for careful observation, data collection and analysis, and development of testable hypotheses for further experimentation. The lesson can be adapted to different grade levels, with students taking on varied levels of responsibility for formulation of hypotheses, experimental design, data collection, and data analysis.

   disadvantaged students; summer vacation; nature activities
AB In a time when electronic devices dominate students' free time, students often stop learning in the summer and instead focus on sedentary indoor activities, like video games and television programs. Sociologists have documented that, for some students, summers result in little learning and contribute to an achievement gap. To help combat "summer learning loss," teachers should implement a summer biology project to provide students with hands-on, inquiry experiences promoting science learning. Assigning long-term activities to be completed during the summer months compels students to explore the outdoors, the learning-loss flow is slowed, and students are better prepared for the start of the next school term.

AB In this animal behavior laboratory, designed to promote a discovery-based approach to laboratory teaching, students first observe the study organism, which gives them the opportunity to decide what behaviors interest them. They work collaboratively to develop their own hypotheses, which can range from simple to complex depending on the course's level. Student groups then design and run experiments to test their hypotheses. At the end of the exercise, the groups present their results to their peers, who are given time to ask questions. This kind of flexible, student-led exercise develops students' reasoning skills and ability to think creatively.

ID GENETIC-ANALYSIS; DROSOPHILA
AB The larval plate test has been used by researchers as a choice test to study the response of terrestrial larvae to various external cues. We describe here a laboratory exercise using third instar larvae of wild-type Drosophila to study the response toward multiple cues including olfactory as well as physical environmental cues such as light. The experiment can be easily carried out in an undergraduate lab and does not require any sophisticated instruments or equipment. The results of a series of experiments indicate the extent of response that each of the cue generates relative to the other. The highlight of the article however is the pre-lab discussion that can be done with students by putting forth various possible designs followed by discussion regarding the benefits and/or errors that could creep into the results obtained by using a particular design. Such a discussion would prove to be helpful in enhancing student understanding of experimental design, especially in designing experiments in animal behavior. The article also includes an extended theoretical problem set that can be used by facilitators in an undergraduate classroom activity.

AB Blood Sugar Balance (BSB) is an accessible web-based game, created as an extension of our federally funded type 2 diabetes curriculum for high school biology classrooms. Modeling of complex systems and diseases, like metabolism and type 2 diabetes (T2D), is especially difficult and deeply impactful when executed in an engaging way. Blood Sugar Balance integrates environmental factors, biological factors, and personal choices to model glucose metabolism and understand the impact and risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Players earn points during gameplay by ensuring their game character maintains healthy blood glucose levels throughout the play period by regulating them. Players must make choices about food, exercise, and the release of hormones from the pancreas to manage blood glucose levels. Game settings can model the stages of type 2 diabetes as well as environmental factors that limit access to food, exercise, and health care options. Gameplay is fast and engaging, allowing exploration of factors that impact the final score. For example, how might accessibility to insulin impact the final score while playing at the type 2 diabetes setting? Here we describe the development of Blood Sugar Balance and the integration of data analysis into the accompanying NGSS-aligned lesson plan.

TI Using Phenology to Teach Students about Climate Change and the Effect on

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; phenology; biodiversity; inquiry; journaling; poetry;
   citizen science
AB In biology class, climate change is relevant because of its impact on biodiversity. While the subject of climate change should be taught in science classes, problems with teaching it involve preconceived ideas that can create barriers. Instruction is also hindered by a lack of materials that support direct observation by students in both rural and urban areas. An inquiry-based approach incorporating phenology offers a possible solution to the problem, giving students the ability to observe climate change firsthand. Phenology is the practice of observing flora or fauna over a time period within a geographic area and recording seasonal changes. The data can be uploaded into the National Phenology Network for study purposes. This website also provides materials, lesson plans, and instructions for observing seasonal changes and connecting them to climate change, which can then be correlated to impacts on biodiversity. The Department of Natural Resources National Wildlife Federation also has material that can help the instructional process. When students are involved in direct observational activities, climate change moves from an abstract concept to a concrete phenomenon. Their new knowledge can empower students to try and make a difference at a local level.

AB Creating new assessments in biology courses for every student cohort is difficult. To address this issue, we build assessments around scenarios we write that are inspired by current primary literature. Here, we describe how to find source material for scenarios, how to write them, and how we use scenarios together with their associated questions in the classroom. Students responded positively to scenario-based question sets on tests, as survey respondents reported reduced test anxiety and increased appreciation for real-world applications of course content.

AB Citizen science programs, like FrogWatch USA, offer simple training guidelines to collect field data, which provides records across broad geographical locations, allowing for the study of population trends on a large scale. Due to the relative ease of implementing the protocol, this program can easily be used in undergraduate and high school courses to provide an active learning environment and independent research opportunities. Here, we describe how FrogWatch USA call surveys were paired with traditional trapping surveys and conclude that call surveys can be useful in ecological monitoring. We suggest recommendations on how this program can be utilized in different settings and across disciplines.

AB Animal dissection is practiced to varying degrees around the world and is particularly prevalent in North America throughout all levels of education. However, a growing number of studies suggest that non-animal teaching methods (NAMs) (e.g., virtual anatomy tools and three-dimensional models) are better for achieving learning goals compared to dissection. We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2005 and 2020 that evaluated the pedagogical value of NAMs versus animal dissection. Our results from 20 published studies show that in 95% of the studies (19/20) students at all education levels (secondary, postsecondary, and medical school) performed at least as well-and in most of those studies better (14/19)-when they used NAMs compared to animal dissection. These results provide compelling evidence in support of the 3Rs' principle of replacement. Given that NAMs have been demonstrated as effective for science education, steps should be taken by educational institutions to phase out animal dissection.

AB The concept of solubility, and its relation to molecular structure, is important for understanding the properties of biological molecules in solution as they interact with the solvent and with each other. To demonstrate the relation between structure, solubility, and buffering capacity, we report a low-cost laboratory exercise using monosodium glutamate (MSG) as a model solute. Students observe how glutamate solution initially resists acidification and how glutamate solubility is first decreased and then restored with acidification. Students should interpret these observations relative to the structure of the solute. This exercise has been employed in introductory level courses for both biology majors and nonmajors and would also be appropriate for AP Biology.

AB Students' sound knowledge about osmosis can lead to their understanding of other related biological processes that require the movement of materials across cell membranes, such as photosynthesis, homeostasis, and cellular respiration. However, students have difficulties to understand osmosis. This challenge has been attributed to the abstract nature of the concept and the way it is presented to students. Thus, we present an engineering design, integrated biology unit in which students use the engineering design process to learn about osmosis and its related concepts. A dependent t-test revealed statistically significant differences in students' understanding of osmosis and related concepts, and the engineering design process before and after the unit. Overall, in this unit students developed the understanding of osmosis in a real-world context through an engineering design process.

AB Microplastic particles (MPs) less than 5 mm in size swirl and bob in freshwaters and seas around the world. To familiarize college biology students with the pressing issue of microplastic pollution and designing their own experiments, I assigned investigatation into whether marine copepods (Tigriopus californicus) or freshwater cladocerans (Daphnia magna) ingest MPs in the laboratory.
   Groups of students produced a title, hypothesis, and annotated bibliography. They developed their experiments in a project planning table. They carried out three weeks of experiments. Students wrote papers or gave poster presentations. They wrote reflections that revealed expected gains, such as recognition of the importance of sample size, and more nuanced gains, such as developing personal views on working with live organisms.
   The students found that 20 mu m of blue MPs could be seen within the digestive tract and released fecal pellets of Tigriopus califomicus within 24 hours. And, 20 mu m of red MPs accumulated in the digestive tract of Daphnia magna within two days. The ingestion did not increase death rates over controls (in keeping with much published research on this topic). Students had the opportunity to see and reflect on the direct interaction of organisms with plastic pollution.

AB Human evolution is a sensitive and controversial topic, which might explain why it is not included in science curricula or textbooks in many countries. We prepared an online student-centered human evolution activity dealing with lactose tolerance. In constructing the activity, we considered the following design principles: a medical issue connected to students' lives, a noncontentious topic of human evolution, and a one-step genetic example that can be demonstrated by basic bioinformatics tools. The activity consists of four units dealing with the activity of the enzyme lactase in our small intestine, the differences in lactose tolerance in people from different origins, the genetic foundation of lactose tolerance, and an extension unit dealing with the control of lactase gene expression. The activity was experienced by a pilot group of approximately 100 students, preservice and in-service teachers who showed great interest in the genetics of a trait that has undergone evolutionary changes. We noted the need for a teacher as mediator while students perform the activity. We suggest using the activity in the context of evolution, genetics, or when teaching about systems of the human body, either all units in succession or as a modular activity.

AB Pesticides and their associated modes of action serve as real-world examples of chemical toxicity, stimulating student interest and supporting their understanding of nervous system function and cell signaling. An open-source web application called "Neuron-to-Neuron Normal and Toxic Actions" hosts narrated animations of pesticide toxic actions and exists as a resource for instructors of advanced secondary or undergraduate biology courses. This article describes the features of the web application, reports student feedback on the animations, and details a cooperative learning procedure for instructors to use the web application in online learning environments or in-person classroom settings with technology support.

AB This article presents the development and testing of a content-based video exchange model as a motivating means to introduce lower secondary English learners to English as the language of science. The central goal was that students reach the required curricular content knowledge despite learning some of the content in a foreign language. The model was tested in German seventh-grade classes (n = 133), in which the students communicated with U.S. eighth-graders on the topic of ecology. Following field trips to a forest and a desert ecosystem, students presented and compared biotic and abiotic data in videos. The German students' content knowledge and their motivation were assessed in a pretest/posttest design. They met the curricular outcome requirements, and their motivation was remarkably high at both test times. We discuss implications for further application of the exchange model.

DT Article
DE diversity in science; collaborative education-research; botanical
   survey; California grassland; floristics
AB We present results from the first year of a three-year extramurally funded project involving a partnership between an ethnically diverse urban high school and professional research botanists. The goals are to provide students exposure to real-world science, broaden interest in scientific fields of study, and increase floristic data and herbarium specimen collections in under-sampled areas of Solano County, California. A floristic survey was conducted in a 425-acre, open-space public park in Vacaville, California, that is actively grazed by cattle and characterized by grasses, forbs, and oaks. A total of 77 students were enrolled in the course associated with the partnership, and 47 participated in four visits to the collection site. Twenty-five unique plant specimens were collected, including 14 native and 11 introduced species. Results of a student perception survey suggest that the partnership has had a positive impact on students' understanding of scientific methodology and interest in pursuing a science career. Perception survey results were disaggregated by ethnicity; Hispanic students, more than any other group, indicated that they feel more confident in scientific research and writing skills. There was no significant difference between male and female students' responses.

AB This article describes an easily made physical lung model for teaching about lung ventilation. It has rectified some major shortcomings of the bell-jar balloon model by having a fluid-filled "pleural cavity," a dome-shaped "diaphragm," and an inflated "lung" at rest. The model can be used to tackle some misconceptions about ventilation as well as to learn some difficult concepts such as the negative pleural pressure and pneumothorax.

DE online learning; microscopy; distant labs; biology instruction
AB One of the central ideas behind microbiology is to see images that are not available to the naked eye. Through the use of digital microscopes, students in online courses can have exposure to those images, but the ability to view images of samples produced by the students is something that is not typically or easily replicated in an online course. The high cost of good-quality optical microscopes and the difficulty of using complex microscopes independently and communicating results are barriers to including this in an online lab course. Through the use of a lower-cost digital microscope that is easy to use, students are able to enjoy the experience of viewing images of microbes from their own sample and preparation.

AB Valley fever, a disease caused by the soilborne fungal pathogen Coccidioides spp., is on the rise in the southwestern United States and is suspected of expanding its habitat in response to climate change. Many people residing in endemic areas are unaware of the risk of contracting coccidioidomycosis by inhaling fugitive dust that may contain dormant arthroconidia of this fungus. In an effort to teach students about the ongoing epidemic of valley fever and reduce incidence of the disease through education, we developed an inquiry-based, multi-focus laboratory exercise that (1) increases awareness of valley fever incidence, disease symptoms, and ongoing efforts of disease prevention; (2) teaches about the pathogen's ecology; and (3) familiarizes students with molecular techniques targeting pathogen identification. This laboratory exercise uses polymerase chain reaction to detect Coccidioides spp. in DNA extracts from soil samples collected by students across different soil environments. Additionally, this exercise will teach students how to use publicly available data to investigate disease incidence over time and characterize soils the pathogen may inhabit.

AB Enzyme kinetics is an essential process of life, but it is a concept that challenges introductory biology students. Most enzyme kinetics laboratory activities either use hazardous chemicals to visualize the enzyme product or do not afford quantitative analysis at all. We have designed an inquiry-based activity that provides insight into enzyme function and that is budget friendly, safe, and produces quantitative results. The materials required are household products, so this activity can be adapted even for online classes. Furthermore, we suggest options for a sequential, experiential experiment-design activity for students.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE DNA barcoding; macroinvertebrates; PCR; polymerase chain reaction; gel
   electrophorsis; stream quality
AB Macroinvertebrates are readily available at the undergraduate level and provide an indicator of stream quality. DNA barcoding is the use of a sequence comparison of a specific region of the DNA that allows for classification of the organism. In most undergraduate courses, the discussion of genetic identification and stream quality assessment remain separated concepts. However, joining these lectures into a three-part laboratory learning module could bridge this gap and prepare students for a real-world application. During the first week of the proposed activity, students perform taxonomic identification. The following week, they perform a DNA isolation. In the last week, they use polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis, possibly with a lecture examining a barcode for an example of the final outcome. In our research, we have determined effective methods that will allow all three sections to be completed in three three-hour undergraduate lab sessions, with minor modifications. Furthermore, the data we collected showed 54% efficiency. The methods we outline introduce new techniques and skills that prepare students for next-level education or employment and attempt to integrate ecological or environmental analysis with genetic analysis and DNA extraction techniques, making this lab series worth exploring at the undergraduate level.

   Koch's postulates; Typhoid Mary; epidemiology
ID REFLECTIVE APPROACH; HISTORY; SCIENCE; EXPLICIT
AB Understanding Koch's postulates, including how they are used to study the spread of disease within a population, is central to the teaching of microbiology. These concepts are often presented and discussed with little or no historical background, and as a result students fail to appreciate how the field has developed from past to present. We designed a lesson based on the story of Typhoid Mary to engage students in the learning and application of Koch's postulates in the field of epidemiology and provide insight into the interplay between scientists and the public as illustrated by this episode. The lesson uses an interrupted story technique in which students watch a documentary about Typhoid Mary, with pauses to discuss the events and engage in a role-play to reenact Mary's trial. The purpose is to improve student understanding of central concepts and to foster a deeper understanding of issues associated with the nature of science (NOS), such as how the process of science is influenced by culture and society (and vice versa). This lesson plan was created for a college-level microbiology course for non-majors, but can be easily modified for use in high school settings.

ID ATTACHMENT; CHILDREN; IMPACT
AB Children today do not spend as much time outside as they did in previous generations; consequently, they are not building connectedness to nature and are less likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviors. Environmental education is one way to ameliorate this problem. However, teachers are limited by their access to natural habitats, time, and field expertise. To address both of these issues, I present an inquiry-based activity for both Advanced Placement and general high school biology that requires students to spend time in nature, use authentic field methods for collecting data, and apply their findings to pertinent conservation issues. This four-day activity uses a simplified approach, called the meter stick random sampling method, to measure plant biodiversity of different local habitats. Time-efficient and not reliant on species identification, this method is designed so students can repeat this procedure in their backyards or at a local nature preserve. The data can be used to discuss how human disturbance of habitat affects biodiversity, the importance of biodiversity for the stability of ecosystems, and how to restore biodiversity locally.

DE eDNA; amphibians; biodiversity sampling; experiential learning
AB Experiential learning helps students make connections between different skill sets and allows them to engage in a deeper level of inquiry. To enhance the connection between field and laboratory practice for undergraduate students in our wildlife ecology curriculum, we developed an exercise using environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis. eDNA sampling involves extracting and amplifying the DNA from specific organisms from an environmental sample, rather than from the organisms themselves, and has been rapidly adopted by conservation practitioners around the world. In our activity, students collect water samples from a local pond and process them to detect the presence of American bullfrogs. Practicing this procedure not only introduces them to professional skills they may utilize in their careers, but also helps create context for how laboratory science and field work support each other and can be used to connect to larger issues of conservation, environmental studies, or ecology.

AB Fish species are an important food resource all over the world, but the fishing practices of human beings are slowly driving many fish species to extinction. However, little is being done to communicate the problem of overfishing to the general public. In this three-part activity, students are introduced to the concepts of buoyancy and overfishing in an effort to provide a glimpse of how interesting fish are, and to raise awareness of overfishing. The students investigate buoyancy and gas compressibility by recreating a mysterious boat-sinking in the classroom, and by manipulating the buoyancy of artificial fish. By engaging in "fishing expeditions" with diminishing returns, the students learn why fish populations decline when we take too many of them. Throughout the activity, students have the opportunity to learn science as inquiry and the nature of science as presented in the National Science Education Standards.

AB With the looming global population crisis, it is more important now than ever that students understand what factors influence population dynamics. We present three learning modules with authentic, student-centered investigations that explore rates of population growth and the importance of resources. These interdisciplinary modules integrate biology, mathematics, and computer-literacy concepts aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards. The activities are appropriate for middle and high school science classes and for introductory college-level biology courses. The modules incorporate experimentation, data collection and analysis, drawing conclusions, and application of studied principles to explore factors affecting population dynamics in fruit flies. The variables explored include initial population structure, food availability, and space of the enclosed population. In addition, we present a computational simulation in which students can alter the same variables explored in the live experimental modules to test predictions on the consequences of altering the variables. Free web-based graphing (Joinpoint) and simulation software (NetLogo) allows students to work at home or at school.

AB The importance of extant biodiversity, concerns regarding the rising Anthropocene extinction rates, and commitments made by signatories to biodiversity conventions each increase demands for timely data. However, as species and conservation indicators become more complex, the less accessible they are to educators. New pedagogies are needed so that students can generate their own data for studies of biodiversity and extinction. I present a simple indicator of species diversity that examines declines in species' populations and whether or not these species subsequently recovered or faced extinction. Using such data, 14 threatened species are used as examples of the time taken for each species to reach a point of either recovery or extinction. The learning and pedagogical context for this information is reviewed, student use of the data demonstrated, and the lesson evaluated according to its learning objectives.

AB The process of exploration and the methods that scientists use to conduct research are fundamental to science education. In this activity, authentic scientific practices are used to develop hypotheses to explain the natural world. Students observe grass shrimp in aquaria and construct an ethogram, which is a compilation of the observable behaviors an animal exhibits. They then conduct an experiment, just as real scientists would, to determine how changes in the environment alter shrimp behavior. This activity is designed for a fourth-grade science class and allows students to experience the excitement of observing a live organism while learning about scientific inquiry, and also reinforces quantification and graphing skills. "Do You See What I See" covers Next Generation Science Standards and addresses the science and engineering practices of engaging in argument from evidence.

AB Freshman students are instructed to read a popular science book related to the topic of the course and produce an outline of the work. To achieve this, they must identify the author's thesis and the arguments brought forth in support of the thesis. This analysis is done for the whole book and is repeated for every chapter. This exercise develops the ability to grasp how experiments serve as evidence in scientific discourse. This gives students the tools to read popular science books critically. Given the ease of access to this type of resource, this assignment may develop lifelong skills for scientifically informed citizens.

AB The choice of the scientific method to be used depends on the question to be investigated, the type of study being performed, and the maturity of the particular subdiscipline. I review the scientific methods frequently used in biology since Darwin, the aspects of the nature of science relevant for teaching and learning about evolution, and some recent studies that tested the theory of evolution and some of its features. I also present some guidelines for teachers, within an inquiry-based instructional framework, to facilitate students' understanding that hypothesis-driven and observation-driven studies are equally important and responsible for the advancement of scientific knowledge in the field of biology, both in the past and in the present.

AB The nature of science (NOS) is an often neglected part of science teaching, yet it provides a vital background for students, detailing how science and scientists work and how scientific knowledge is created, validated, and influenced. Here, I review the concept of NOS and some of the challenges to its inclusion in science classes. In addition, I outline proposals, including those in the Next Generation Science Standards, for those aspects of NOS that should be featured in science classes. Finally, I discuss distinctions in NOS specific to the science of biology and conclude with some thoughts on how NOS can be incorporated into science instruction.

AB Using Pompe disease as a context affords the opportunity for students to consider multiple biological concepts and embraces the Next Generation Science Standards Disciplinary Core Ideas Structure and Function (LS1.A) and Inheritance of Traits (LS3.A) as well as Crosscutting Concepts Structure and Function and Cause and Effect. These crosscutting concepts are very much interrelated as we consider progression of disease from the molecular to the organismal level. The concepts are repeatedly emphasized, providing "explicit instructional support" for students to "develop a cumulative, coherent, and usable understanding of science and engineering." DNA, proteins, enzymes, genetics, and human disease are taught together through the story of patients with Pompe disease as students engage in a simulated clinical assay and genetic analysis and present their findings in grand rounds. The activity is one of multiple lessons sequenced to scaffold student understanding of clinical and translational science, starting with a first-person perspective of a father who loses his infant son to Pompe and concluding with a role play based on actual events surrounding approval of human clinical trials of gene therapy for Pompe disease.

AB Students often find it challenging to create images of complex, abstract biological processes. Using modified storyboards, which contain predrawn images, students can visualize the process and anchor ideas from activities, labs, and lectures. Storyboards are useful in assessing students' understanding of content in larger contexts. They enable students to use models to construct explanations, with evidence to support hypotheses - practices emphasized in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Storyboards provide an opportunity for performance assessment of students' content knowledge against a backdrop of observing patterns, determining scale, and establishing relationships between structure and function - crosscutting concepts within the NGSS framework.

AB Optimal foraging theory attempts to explain the foraging patterns observed in animals, including their choice of particular food items and foraging locations. We describe three experiments designed to test hypotheses about food choice and foraging habitat preference using bird feeders. These experiments can be used alone or in combination and can also provide a foundation for students to develop extensions incorporating the basic methodology.

TI Generating Testable Questions in the Science Classroom: The BDC Model
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE Divergent thinking; convergent thinking; inquiry learning;
   visualization; plant growth
AB Guiding students to generate testable scientific questions is essential in the inquiry classroom, but it is not easy. The purpose of the BDC ("Big Idea, Divergent Thinking, and Convergent Thinking") instructional model is to to scaffold students' inquiry learning. We illustrate the use of this model with an example lesson, designed to help 5th-grade students understand the concept of plant growth. The BDC model functions as an exploration of, and a connection with, related information among students' scientific knowledge, skills, and practice, so that students can further generate research ideas. Students are able to more easily formulate testable questions and are also highly motivated throughout the course of their inquiry practice. This instructional model provides teachers with a practical and meaningful tool, one that increases students' capabilities to formulate researchable questions and sustains their motivation to engage in activities of scientific and creative inquiry.

It's no wonder that entry-level biology students are confused, when biologists have multiple definitions of "species." We developed this speciation activity to provide clarity and allow students a hands-on experience with a speciation model.

DE Hematocrit; erythropoietin; inquiry; experimental design; scientific

AB In this practice-based lab, students are provided with four Olympic athlete profiles and simulated blood and urine samples to test for illegal substances and blood-doping practices. Throughout the course of the lab, students design and conduct a testing procedure and use their results to determine which athletes won their medals fairly. All of the materials, which simulate the blood, urine, and testing compounds, are available at the grocery store. This real-world problem engages students to think about blood doping, hormones associated with red-blood-cell production, and detection techniques employed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The Olympics, as well as the news coverage of Lance Armstrong's admission to blood doping in 2013, makes this lab more relevant to students' lives, which is supported by our students' reactions to the lab.

AB In daily life, students are allowed to use words such as "more," "some," or "increase-decrease" to describe the relationship between two events. In science, concise description is necessary, which requires the contribution of math. In the summer component of the Science Research Institute program, students integrated essential math concepts with their research questions. Students designed experiments using data-acquisition units to monitor heart rate and pulse in order to obtain enough statistical power to mathematically use the words "more" or "increase-decrease." Overall, students gained an appreciation for the requirement of math to support the scientific question and research design.

Students work with live algae, brine shrimp, and sea anemones to test hypotheses regarding the trophic interactions among species, the exchange of nutrients and gases, and the optimal ratio of producers to consumers and predators in enclosed, artificial-seawater ecosystems. In the initial iteration of the activity, multiple ecosystems that differ in their composition of organisms are assembled according to simple recipes by individual students or small lab groups. Two weeks later, the ecosystems are deconstructed, and the students tally the organisms and assess key water-quality measures, including salinity, pH, and ammonia levels. Some sample data and results are presented, as well as tips for successful implementation.

AB The educational video game Mission Biotech provides a virtual experience for students in learning biotechnology materials and tools. This study explores the use of Mission Biotech and the associated curriculum by three high school teachers and their students. All three classes demonstrated gains on a curriculum-aligned test of science content. Students from two of the classes showed gains on a standards-aligned test of content; students from the third class did not demonstrate statistically significant gains. This result is attributable to a ceiling effect. The results support the idea that video games can be useful in classroom contexts. No statistically significant changes were found when looking at how the game affected student attitudes toward science and science careers.

Pre- and postassessments from experimental versus control sections over three semesters showed that most students improved in their understanding of the scientific method and experimental design skills. Students exhibited improvement in their ability to create hypotheses and correctly identify controls and dependent variables. However, students in both groups struggled with the identification of independent variable and controlled variables.

DE Translation; protein synthesis; mRNA sequencing; amino acids;
   polypeptide chain
AB During this activity, by making beaded bracelets that represent the steps of translation, students simulate the creation of an amino acid chain. They are given an mRNA sequence that they translate into a corresponding polypeptide chain (beads). This activity focuses on the events and sites of translation. The activity provides students with a closer look at the process of translation, not focused solely on pairing codons with amino acids. The students move throughout the classroom, which simulates a nucleus, cytoplasm, a ribosome, and the A site, a P site, and an E site of a ribosome.

AB We question the use of mechanical models, such as coin flipping, to represent the probabilities of gender distributions in sibship families consisting of two children. Both the assumptions of the models and the reliability of the data should be evaluated. Using models without these critical evaluations may tend to perpetuate myths rather than elucidate biological realities.

DE Structure and function; surface area; models; cognitive development
AB We present an activity that models the teaching of content knowledge that transfers to many areas of the life sciences and simultaneously targets growth in cognitive development. The activity provides students with concrete objects and thinking experiences that facilitate an understanding of how surface area, in the context of biological systems, is a critical and common factor in life-supporting functions. Alveolus structure and gas exchange in the lungs, nephron structure and water retention in the kidneys, villus structure and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, and root-hair structure and nutrient absorption in plants are all biological examples in which surface area plays a key role in living things. In addition, this activity incorporates components that engage students in thinking about proportional reasoning, as many students lack the proportional thinking skills needed to fully understand this structure/function relationship or to transfer the relationship to a new, but related, situation.

AB Students of animal behavior must learn to accurately define and quantify observations and to be aware of observational bias. We designed an introductory, college-level animal behavior laboratory that uses a free, online citizen-science project (CamClickr) to help students identify and overcome biases when interpreting observations. The exercise encourages proficiency in making structural descriptions of animal behavior while teaching students to use ethograms to generate and test discrete hypotheses.

Because students often struggle to understand these diagrams, I developed a simple, inexpensive classroom model. Made of pipe cleaners, it is easily manipulated to rotate branches, compare topologies, map complete lineages, identify informative phylogenetic features, and examine the effects of superficial structural changes.

ID OPEN TEXTBOOK; ADOPTION
AB To reduce the cost of educational materials needed by students, we generated a no-cost open educational resources (OER) textbook for an undergraduate level cell biology course. Cell biology is part of the curriculum in various undergraduate degrees for science, technology, engineering, and math majors, therefore generation of OER targets a large population of students. In addition to cost reduction, we unified the textbook content with course learning outcomes to ensure that the students have a clear understanding of course goals. To assess student perceptions of OER materials and their experiences related to learning outcomes, surveys were administered to students enrolled in sections of cell biology using a traditional textbook and those enrolled in sections using the OER. Data showed positive student attitudes about learning, accessibility, and cost of OER, supporting the use of no-cost OER in undergraduate classrooms and beyond.

By utilizing digital storytelling projects to showcase course competencies in an undergraduate biology course, students were able to apply subject matter outside the classroom. In this post hoc analysis of pretest and posttest scores from a two-year Florida college, significant results with medium effect sizes were shown for classes engaged in digital storytelling projects. It was determined that age was not a significant factor.

   Student Perspectives and Outcomes

ID MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT; SCIENCE; INQUIRY; VIEWS
AB Undergraduate science students who volunteer within a research laboratory group, or participate in funded research opportunities, in general are those who have the opportunity to engage in authentic research. In this article, we report the findings from two different iterations of a semester- long collaboration between a biology faculty member and a science education faculty member at a major research institution in the Southeastern United States. Specifically, the faculty members designed an ecology laboratory course for upper- level undergraduate students (primarily biology majors) where they would engage in an original and highly authentic ecological research project. The goal of this course was to have students explicitly learn about the nature of science (NOS), and authentic scientific practices such as inquiry and experimentation in the context of their own research. In the second year of the course, the global COVID-19 pandemic forced us to modify our approach to accomplish the same goals, but now in a remote and online format. Using questionnaires, concept inventories, and semi-structured interviews, the impact of the course on students' understandings of NOS, inquiry, and experimentation, in addition to their perspectives on the experience within the course compared to prior laboratory coursework, was investigated. We found that students showed modest gains in each of the aforementioned desirable outcomes. These gains were generally comparable in both face-to-face and remote course settings. Additionally, students shared with us their preference for authentic laboratory work as compared with the typical laboratory work with its given research question and step-by-step instructions. Our research demonstrates what is possible in both face-to-face and remote undergraduate laboratory courses in biology and the positive impact that was observed in our students. We hope it serves as a model for other scientists and science educators as they collaborate to design authentic research-based coursework for undergraduate biology students.

AB Energy and biomass distribution in the ecological sciences have long been approximated by complex, often idealized scientific models. When utilized appropriately, these models are powerful tools for students, who must organize evidence and make data-driven predictions surrounding trophic level interactions. However, the abstract nature of ecological models can present a significant challenge to students who generally require concrete experiences to make sense of complex scientific ideas. Inquiry-centered field experiences serve to bypass this barrier, providing much-needed context by leveraging student data to develop a deep conceptual understanding of foundational ecological principles.

AB The human gut microbiome is an important part of the digestive system and the human body as a whole. The abundance and richness of bacterial species in your digestive tract change based on your diet and lifestyle. A diet full of fresh vegetables, meat, and whole grains will cultivate a variety of bacteria that will help you absorb nutrients, prevent disease, keep your skin hydrated, and even improve cognitive function. A diet of sugarand fat-rich foods will cultivate less diverse bacteria and species that cause inflammation in your gut and impair memory and focus (Quercia et al., 2014). I designed a simulation that uses inquiry and game play to teach high school (grades 9-12) biology students these concepts. The game involves teamwork, decisions about diet, cause and effect of various life events, and data analysis. Educational approaches such as game play and active learning have been shown to improve student engagement, retention of concepts, and overall success of a lesson (Sengupta and Clark, 2016; Michael, 2006).

AB Idiograms are graphical representations in which chromosomes appear ordered by their relative size, homology groups, and the presence of cytogenetic landmarks such as centromeres, secondary constrictions, and banding patterns. They have become crucial elements in cytogenetic research. Here, we describe a simple protocol for spreadsheet software to draw idiograms and map any type of sequence onto them. These graphs can be easily used to present research results and can become the basis to raise and resolve questions related to different biological issues. The methodology is inexpensive, easy to follow, and allows customization to meet a wide range of educational scenarios focused in genetics and evolution.

ID TEACHING EVOLUTION
AB This classroom activity highlights how evolution by natural selection is nonteleological-that is, not guided by need, by organismal intent, by inherent progress, by an external ideal, or by any observable pur posive agent. Rather, it is driven by chance opportunity, environmental context, and historical happenstance. Students simulate the evolution of a population of tin cans, based on temperature retention/loss in either arctic or hot desert habitats. Chance and necessity interact in separate lab groups (as isolated populations), based on similar starting organisms. The process demonstrates not only selection but also how even organisms in similar environments may not evolve with identical traits, depending on available mutations. It shows that even when selection occurs, it may not do so consistently or uniformly with each generation. It shows both divergence based on different contexts of selection and variability based on the vagaries of history.

ID REALITY
AB This classroom exercise utilizes a free mobile virtual reality app to introduce students to (1) the process by which paleoanthropologists find and interpret fossils, (2) the importance of two recent hominin fossil finds in the Cradle of Humankind of South Africa, and (3) the variety of science careers that contribute to paleoanthropological research. Before their virtual field trip, learners are introduced to the Homo naledi and Australopithecus sediba discoveries and to some of the researchers from the team through a collection of online resources. In the app, learners explore and find fossils in the Dinaledi Chamber of Rising Star Cave in South Africa, where the first fossils of H. naledi were found. Post exploration analysis and reflection prompts encourage learners to consider how researchers decide how and where to excavate, which skills are needed to study our human origins, and why this research is important.

AB Fluorescence technology has many useful applications for both research and teaching, among them the detection of fluorescence in live transgenic organisms and of DNA in agarose gels. However, dedicated fluorescence imaging systems can be expensive and complex. We describe a simple apparatus for non-microscopic fluorescence imaging using affordable and readily available parts. We describe three activities of increasing complexity that utilize fluorescence illumination and teach principles of fluorescence. At the high school level, our more advanced activities can be used for lessons addressing NGSS performance expectations in HS-LS3 and HS-LS4.

TI How Do Scientists Know? Answering High School Students' Questions with
   an Ecological Sampling Unit
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE ecology; sampling; environment; populations; data collection
AB What do animals eat? What animals are present in a habitat? How many animals are present? How was the habitat different years ago? How old is this animal? These are all questions that scientists want to answer. We know the answers to questions like these from data collected by scientists in a variety of ways. Science is evidence based, and conclusions are arrived at after multiple replicable experiments. Presented here are six ecological scenarios that demonstrate how scientists arrive at answers to population ecology questions. These lessons can be implemented as single activities that supplement a high school ecology or environmental science curricular unit or as a multiday rotation of stations in which students practice field sampling techniques used in population and community ecology, designed to answer ecological questions. Student scientists learn how to use indirect sampling methods to estimate abundance, density, age, and population size using mark-recapture, transects, and quadrats to model authentic field methods. They calculate species richness and biodiversity with a simplified Simpson's diversity index and describe species age structure and distribution using tree rings, sheep horns, and camera trap images. Students also learn to display population data appropriately, graphing survivorship and richness vs. area and studying trophic pyramids.

AB The human brain is limited by its capacity and incapable of memorizing all information. The memory system evolved to give preference to memory information related to maintaining and increasing individual fitness. We have chosen fungi, a heavily neglected area in science education research, to investigate which kind of information about mushrooms will be better retained by secondary school students. Furthermore, we investigated whether information about mushroom toxicity is better retained when presented only orally or in combination with a written text. The research sample consisted of 160 secondary school students from Slovakia. Pretest/posttest experimental between-subject and within-subject design was used to examine research questions. Data were collected through questionnaires (using a Likert response scale). We found that survival-relevant information (i.e., mushroom toxicity) was retained significantly better than survival-irrelevant information (i.e., mushroom naming and occurrence), but there were no differences in recall between the presentation conditions. Unexpectedly, male students retained information about mushroom toxicity significantly better than female students. Our results suggest that information retention by secondary school students in regard to mushrooms that cause serious poisoning is in accordance with evolutionary predictions and can be utilized by science teachers.

AB Many undergraduate students pursuing life science majors are not aware of job options outside of medicine and academic research, because many departments stress these as the only primary career pathways. In addition, biology students often do not have many opportunities to develop their science communication and presentation skills due to the rigorous course requirements inherent in these fields that would make them more competitive for careers in biotechnology. We developed a course using diverse pedagogies designed to introduce students to new careers in biotechnology, to help them understand the role of ethics in the drug development pipeline, and to incorporate more communication assignments, such as student presentations and journal-club-style paper discussions to more effectively prepare them for many STEM-based career possibilities. By the end of the course, students had broader knowledge of previously unknown science careers, had improved their scientific communication skills, and reported a greater understanding of course material as a result of the science communication assignments.

ID GENE; IDENTIFICATION; REPEATS
AB CRISPR (also known as CRISPR-Cas9) is a powerful biotechnology tool that gives scientists unprecedented access to the genetic makeup of all living organisms, including humans. It originally evolved as an adaptive immune system in bacteria to defend against viruses. When artificially harnessed in the laboratory it allows scientists to accurately and precisely edit genes, almost as if using a word processor. In mice, CRISPR has already been used to trail diabetes, muscular dystrophy, cancer, and blindness. CRISPR has made cultured human cells immune to HIV, and a variety of CRISPR experiments involving human embryos are well under way. But CRISPR is not limited to biomedical applications. It is also revolutionizing the food industry and many areas of biological research. This article provides science educators a broad and up-todate overview of CRISPR, including its discovery, application, and bioethical challenges. It is imperative that science educators help prepare students, both majors and nonmajors, for this compelling new era of biology.

AB The use of game activities is spreading in diverse contexts, including stimulating teamwork and creativity, selecting job candidates, and as a teaching aid. Games are recognized as promoting interaction and engagement among children through an abstract challenge, which often results in emotional reactions. We investigated whether a game-based activity is useful as a tool for teaching entomology, as assessed on the basis of the learning achieved and the feedback provided by students. Student feedback was positive regarding card content, the rules manual, game-play design, and game use (the functional perspective). Likewise, the students also considered the game a fun activity, fast and competitive, and even challenging (the personal perspective). Some difficulties were indicated, such as the amount of initial information required to play. Nonetheless, the game increased student teaming, demonstrating its usefulness as a didactic activity in the classroom. In addition to encouraging creativity and healthy competition among students, the game represents an integrative and dynamic teaching mode that is different from traditional classroom methods.

ID MIDDLE-SCHOOL SCIENCE
AB Given that science and engineering practices are a large focus in the Next Generation Science Standards, biology teachers need to find ways to incorporate the engineering design process into their curriculum. To address this need, I present a lesson that allows for student collaboration in designing and developing a solution to a global problem resulting from overfishing and our use of unsustainable fishing practices. This lesson also demonstrates to students that larger, global issues that seem insurmountable to solve can be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces. My approach involves having students research a problem related to sustainable fishing practices and design a physical model of a solution to combat their specific issue. Peer review is then used in order to help students revise and edit their models during the lesson in response to the peer feedback received. The lesson will culminate in a presentation to the class about the biological, social, and economic ramifications of both their assigned problem and a potential solution.

AB The abundance of online resources that students have access to makes it difficult to determine whether the information they find is accurate. Several online sources have claimed that hamburgers from fast-food chains do not decompose, and we developed two exercises that allow students to (1) test this claim, (2) learn about fungi, and (3) reflect on their eating habits. In both exercises, we inoculated fast-food items with the fungus Rhizopus stolonifer. The first exercise was a controlled experiment with hamburgers, and the second was a screening trial in which all students brought in their own fast-food items. In both exercises, animal-based products and fatty baked products (e.g., biscuits) allowed R. stolonifer to grow, while condiments and bread products tended to inhibit growth. Our students indicated that they would be more critical of online information and that they would eat less fast food. These exercises met our objectives and engaged our students, and we encourage others to develop exercises that examine online claims.

TI Teaching Authentic Soil & Plant Science in Middle School Classrooms with
   a Biochar Case Study

AB We designed two NGSS-aligned middle school classroom experiments to investigate the effects of biochar on plant growth and soil respiration. Biochar is a carbon-rich material, produced by heating organic matter under limited oxygen, that is added to soils to improve fertility, to promote plant growth, and as one possible strategy to help mitigate climate change. The experiments offer an ideal case study for students learning fundamentals of soil and plant interactions. Soils and biochar are accessible, are connected to global issues such as agriculture and climate change, and are the focus of ongoing research in soil science. These classroom experiments promote authentic science because students design replicated experiments, collect and analyze data, discuss variability in the data, and interpret their results in the context of recent research.
