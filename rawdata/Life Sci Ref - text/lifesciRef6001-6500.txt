AB We have recently designed a biochemistry laboratory experiment for the purpose of providing students an advanced experience with enzyme kinetics and the kinetics of binding. Bestatin, a well-known and commercially available general protease inhibitor, is a slow-binding inhibitor of aminopeptidase isolated from Aeromonas proteolytica. The binding is on a timescale slow enough for measurement without the use of a rapid-mixing device. Aminopeptidase inhibition is detected via a standard colorimetric assay with an inexpensive commercially available substrate. The binding of bestatin follows first order binding kinetics with a rate constant k(on) of 59 +/- 5 M-1 s(-1). This aminopeptidase is well characterized with several crystal structures and a published K-i, which students can then use to calculate the value for k(off).

AB The understanding of complex physiological processes requires information from many different areas of knowledge. To meet this interdisciplinary scenario, the ability of integrating and articulating information is demanded. The difficulty of such approach arises because, more often than not, information is fragmented through under graduation education in Health Sciences. Shifting from a fragmentary and deep view of many topics to joining them horizontally in a global view is not a trivial task for teachers to implement. To attain that objective we proposed a course herein described Biochemistry of the envenomation response aimed at integrating previous contents of Health Sciences courses, following international recommendations of interdisciplinary model. The contents were organized by modules with increasing topic complexity. The full understanding of the envenoming pathophysiology of each module would be attained by the integration of knowledge from different disciplines. Active-learning strategy was employed focusing concept map drawing. Evaluation was obtained by a 30-item Likert-type survey answered by ninety students; 84% of the students considered that the number of relations that they were able to establish as seen by concept maps increased throughout the course. Similarly, 98% considered that both the theme and the strategy adopted in the course contributed to develop an interdisciplinary view.

DE building scientific research and communication skills; course-based
   undergraduate research experiences (CUREs); microbiology seminar course;

AB Undergraduate research experiences are key to preparing STEM students for a range of careers and graduate programs, and to impacting retention in STEM. Providing undergraduate research experiences can be challenging for institutions due to the high cost associated with equipment and reagents, lab space, and research mentors. In this study, we present an upper-level microbiology seminar course that does not require these resources, as each student chooses and performs their own research project using data obtained from publicly available datasets. The faculty member provides hands-on instruction and regular feedback to mentor the cohort of students through all stages of their research projects, from honing a research question, to choosing a dataset, to data analysis and visualization. Students build science communication skills through each writing a scientific paper, and creating and presenting a scientific poster. These papers and presentations, along with results from student pre- and post-surveys, demonstrate that students built research and communication skills, while also building their confidence and interest in science careers. To access this research experience, students only need to register for this course; no application or selection is required, and no prior research experience is expected. The use of publicly available data makes this course a low-cost way to integrate authentic research projects into the college curriculum, and can be adapted to courses in any discipline. Such "low-cost CUREs" (course-based undergraduate research experiences) can be used to build capacity for undergraduate research experiences that are so crucial to preparing students for opportunities in and beyond college.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) can provide undergraduate students access to research opportunities when student and faculty resources are limited. In addition to expanding research opportunities, CUREs may also be explored as a pedagogical tool for improving student learning of course content and laboratory skills, as well as improving meta-cognitive features such as confidence. We examined how a 6-week CURE in an upper-level undergraduate biochemistry lab affected student gains in content knowledge and confidence in scientific abilities, compared to a non-CURE section of the same course. We find that gains in content knowledge were similar between CURE and non-CURE sections, indicating the CURE does not negatively impact student learning. The CURE was associated with a statistically significant gain in student confidence, compared to non-CURE group. These results show that even a relatively short CURE can be effective in improving student confidence at scientific research skills, in addition to expanding access to research.

AB Based on recent education reform guidelines to prepare professionals who are able to handle new technological, economic, social, and environmental challenges, pedagogical modifications are deemed necessary by the educators. Specifically, in biology, the rapid changes in the content and biological products demand changes in the curriculum. We aim to address this current need by providing an example of a course that was redesigned to meet the current trends of biological engineering education. In this course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), learning objectives and possible outcomes were developed and assessment mapping was performed to align the course objectives with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) recommendations. A description of how one can assess authentic inquiry courses while adhering to the recommendations are discussed. For example, in this particular course, students completed weekly reflection assignments, maintained lab notebooks that were graded every week, presented their research to their peers at the end of the semester, and submitted a final paper to be graded. "Holistic" engineering is crucial for the all-around development of a 21st century engineer. Altering the traditional lecturing with more hands-on learning is crucial for the development of professional and communication skills of students. Such alterations could lead to the production of well-rounded life-long learners to serve the upcoming world.

AB Determination of enzyme activity is crucial for discovery, research, and development in life sciences. The activity of enzymes is routinely determined using spectrophotometric assays that measure rates of substrate consumption or product formation. Though colorimetric-based detection systems are simple, rapid, and economical to perform, the majority of enzymes are unsuitable for this technique as their substrates/products do not absorb in the UV or visible range. This limitation can be addressed by the use of coupled-enzyme assays or artificial chromogenic substrates; however these approaches have their own drawbacks. Here, we describe a method based on the use of an isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) to measure the heat produced or absorbed during any enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The concept of calorimetric enzyme assays was demonstrated for the determination of enzyme hexokinase activity, which cannot be monitored colorimetrically without first coupling it to another enzymatic reaction. The assay is suitable for incorporation into undergraduate laboratory classes, providing students with an appreciation for; the versatility and ease of use of ITC assays; ITC as a flexible generic method for exploring the functional characteristics of uncharacterized enzymes; an activity detection parameter suitable for enzymes that either have no straightforward colorimetric methods available or require the use of nonartificial chromogenic substrates.

AB The emergence of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had unprecedented effects on medical education worldwide. Sustaining student engagement in virtual learning is an arduous task. Team based learning (TBL) is a learner-centered approach that can facilitate better student engagement. Adapting TBL to online platform may address the challenges faced in virtual learning. This study was conducted to implement and evaluate online TBL among first year MBBS students in Biochemistry. After obtaining informed consent, three online TBL sessions were planned. The Individual Readiness Assessment Test, Group Readiness Assessment Test, and team application were assigned in Google classroom. The students used online platforms for their team interactions. After submitting their assignments, they joined online discussion with facilitator. Peer evaluation was done via Google forms. At the end of all the sessions, the students' perceptions on the process were collected using a structured anonymous feedback with open comments. Analysis of their feedback showed that the students found the process useful and it helped in fostering their team skills. Five major themes emerged on content analysis of the open comments; 'Enriched team skills', 'Gain in knowledge', 'Impact on attitude', 'Interaction during pandemic', and 'Emotional responses'. Students perceived that the online TBL is effective in improving their engagement, learning, and team skills.

AB A laboratory exercise for undergraduate advanced students of enzymology and biocatalysis is presented. Since enzyme assays can be quenched or continuous, this experiment compares the performance of two quenching agents for lactase, in a continuous setup. Enzymatic activity of beta-galactosidase (Aspergillus oryzae) was determined based on the release of 4-nitrophenol from 4-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside using a microplate reader. Sodium carbonate and borate buffer were tested as quenching agents, and experimental control was the unstopped assay. Based on released 4-nitrophenol, enzyme activity, and rate constant k, the students could assess the performance of each termination agent. The experiment promotes disciplinary and transversal competencies, including research-based learning, critical thinking, and introduce the students to high-throughput techniques that are common in the research and development environment.

ID MODEL
AB A high variety of experimental model organisms have been used in developmental biology practical lectures. The work with developing embryos is crucial to make students aware of the multiple biological phenomena underlying normal animal embryogenesis and morphogenesis and represent a unique experimental platform to analyze the impact of molecular signaling in the regulation of all these processes. In particular, Biochemistry undergraduate students enjoy both practical and theoretical lectures on the molecular mechanisms of embryonic development, as that allows them for the integration of crucial molecular concepts (e.g. signaling and signal transduction mechanisms; molecular patterning of development) into the dynamic and progressive context of animal embryonic ontogenesis. Accordingly, it is important to carefully design practical laboratory lectures in developmental biology, as these are a unique pedagogical tools fostering the interests of the students in this subject. This study describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a two-session laboratory practical activity performed by Biochemistry undergraduate students at University of Malaga (Spain). In this practical activity, which takes advantage of the unique characteristics of the chick embryo, students learn how the vertebrate heart forms from the fusion of two bilateral-symmetric cardiac progenitor pools under the guidance of the underlying endoderm. This cheap and easy practical laboratory activity provides relevant visual information on how experimental manipulations can severely influence anatomical form during organ development, as well as an excellent experimental setting to test molecular regulation of morphogenesis in an ex vivo (ex ovo) context.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge to education systems. Most governments around the world have temporarily closed schools, universities, and colleges. At the same time, teachers and students are encouraged to use the online and distance learning programs and platforms as an alternative. In the present study, we proposed a series of innovative solutions in Medical Molecular Biology education during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, including a flipped classroom model, live streaming course, chat Apps, and scientific papers on COVID-19 as additional learning material. Our results demonstrated that these innovations not only help teachers to maintain the teaching process as usual but also be useful for protecting students from psychological trauma. Our study indicates that online education with a well-designed workflow for conducting provides an alternative approach for teachers to maintain quality education during the onset of the emerging crisis.

AB Grades influence students' confidence and decisions to complete STEM degrees and pursue relevant careers. What affects students' confidence and performance in college upper-division biology laboratory courses and how relevant are evaluation methods to career success? STEM laboratory courses are an excellent model to address these issues because of the hybrid environment, combining traditional lecture course format and the practical application of knowledge. We surveyed 567 students in two upper-division laboratory molecular biology courses at a major research university to compare course-content self-assessment, students' predicted grades, and actual grades received. By analyzing students' confidence and correlating them to grades assigned by the instructor, we identified biases including student and Instructor Assistant (IA) gender, IA experience, and academic quarter. Considering the systemic effect of identified biases, a correlation (R-2 = 0.37, p < 0.01) between predicted and actual grades, and weak but statistically significant correlation (R-2 = 0.10, p < 0.01) between students' comprehensive course-content self-assessment and their predicted grade are not surprising. Our analysis suggests that students' quantifiable self-assessment, a relatively simple and data-rich resource, helps identify evaluation bias. If administered periodically throughout the course, these assessments can help mitigate biases, improve student learning, evaluation, and retention in STEM fields.

AB For many students biochemistry is a demanding course because they are expected to apply previously learned foundational concepts to new biological contexts. These foundational concepts serve as a scaffold onto which to build threshold concepts such as the physical basis of interactions. Unfortunately, many students possess misconceptions or gaps in knowledge of these foundational concepts which hinder their understanding of new information. This paper describes the implementation of an iterative process to improve student foundational concept learning in an introductory biochemistry course. The process includes pre-assessment of foundational concept knowledge, introduction of interventions targeting low performing concepts and re-assessment of student learning gains. Diverse active learning strategies such as problem-based worksheets, tactile learning activities, review activities and learning cycle activities were introduced to target concepts including hydrogen bonding, pH/pKa, bond energy and chemical equilibrium. While all active learning strategies resulted in improved posttest scores compared to pretest scores, no one strategy appears to be more beneficial than another. Survey results suggest students recognized the value of utilizing the various active learning strategies in the classroom to enhance critical thinking skills, engagement during class time, and collaboration skills. The process allows instructors the breadth and flexibility to introduce diverse active learning strategies tailored to their specific student needs in an effort to improve student foundational concept learning.

AB Biochemistry is about structure and function, but it is also about data and this is where computers come in. From my time as a graduate student and post doc, whenever I encountered data I thought, "I can work this up by hand, but I think a computer could do a better job." Since that time, I have been working at the interface of biochemistry and computers, by attracting talented students and collaborating with colleagues with complementary skills. This has resulted in several exciting projects: a simulation of 2D electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, the human visualization project, and two different programs that enable biochemists to search protein structures for enzyme active sites: ProMOL () and Moltimate (). The human side of software development for education involved finding the right students and colleagues, communicating effectively across disciplines, building and managing effective teams and the importance of serendipity throughout the process.

AB Individualized instruction of biochemistry has been a promising alternative to large lecture format classes at our institution. The challenge, however, is that individualized instruction courses have larger staff requirements, which can be infeasible under the current scope of educational budget and human resource constraints. In this article, we highlight how we have met those larger staff requirements in a sustainable way by utilizing undergraduate teaching assistants. We also provide an effective framework for recruiting, training, and utilizing undergraduate teaching assistants, which can be replicated in other contexts.

AB The development of social media applications has made it an important part of students' personal lives. In this article, we aim to determine whether social media usage is beneficial or harmful to college students through academic performance. Through a survey of biological undergraduates, we found that boys use social media applications more frequently than girls, and that GPA is inversely related to the number of social media applications that students subscribe to. In addition, we found that using more social media applications is positively related to the amount of time spent on social media per day. Our research shows that social media may have a negative impact on undergraduates' study habits and academic performance. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2019.

AB A flexible and modular peptide modeling set was designed using freely available software tools. The set consists of space-filling models of all 20 naturally occurring amino acid side chains and a modular kit for constructing peptides employing C-alpha carbons and amide bond groups. Connectors that allow free rotation about phi and psi angles on the peptide, together with explicit representation of peptide backbone hydrogen bond donor and acceptors allows for the construction of a wide range of protein secondary structure motifs. The space-filling side chain models highlight the steric, acid-base, and polarity of these groups. These models were printed using relatively affordable commercially available fused filament fabrication printers with minimal postprinting processing. Use of these models in student group activities focused on amino acids and protein secondary structural features is described.

PCC 7120 as a laboratory tool, we designed a comprehensive laboratory practice encompassing several well-established molecular biology techniques and procedures in order to fulfill two main objectives: (1) overexpression and immunodetection of Anabaena flavodoxin in recombinant Escherichia coli cell extracts, and (2) site-directed mutagenesis of the Anabaena flavodoxin gene isiB. This lab practice provides undergraduate students the possibility to perform by themselves several essential techniques in the field. With the aid of professors, students are stimulated to think, to interpret, and to discuss the results based on what they had learned in previous theoretical courses.

AB Drug Discovery is a 13-week lecture and laboratory-based course that was developed to introduce non-science majors to foundational chemistry and biochemistry concepts as they relate to the unifying theme of drug discovery. The first part of this course strives to build students' understanding of molecules, their properties, the differences that enable them to be separated from one another, and their abilities to bind to biological receptors and elicit physiological effects. After building students' molecular worldview, the course then focuses on four classes of drugs: antimicrobials, drugs that affect the mind, steroid-based drugs, and anti-cancer drugs. During each of these modules, an emphasis is placed on how understanding the basis of disease and molecular-level interactions empowers us to identify novel medicinal compounds. Periodic in class discussions based on articles pertinent to class topics ranging from the spread of antibiotic resistance, to the molecular basis of addiction, to rational drug design, are held to enable students to relate course material to pressing problems of national and daily concern. In addition to class time, weekly inquiry-based laboratories allow students to critically analyze data related to course concepts, and later in the semester give students an opportunity to design and implement their own experiments to screen for antimicrobial activity. This course provides students with an understanding of the importance of chemistry and biochemistry to human health while emphasizing the process, strategies, and challenges related to drug discovery.

AB A recent scientific discipline, bioinformatics, defined as using informatics for the study of biological problems, is now a requirement for the study of biological sciences. Bioinformatics has become such a powerful and popular discipline that several academic institutions have created programs in this field, allowing students to become specialized. However, biology students who are not involved in a bioinformatics program also need a solid toolbox of bioinformatics software and skills. Therefore, we have developed a completely online bioinformatics course for non-bioinformaticians, entitled "BIF-1901 Introduction a la bio-informatique et a ses outils (Introduction to bioinformatics and bioinformatics tools)," given by the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Bioinformatics of Universite Laval (Quebec City, Canada). This course requires neither a bioinformatics background nor specific skills in informatics. The underlying main goal was to produce a completely online up-to-date bioinformatics course, including practical exercises, with an intuitive pedagogical framework. The course, BIF-1901, was conceived to cover the three fundamental aspects of bioinformatics: (1) informatics, (2) biological sequence analysis, and (3) structural bioinformatics. This article discusses the content of the modules, the evaluations, the pedagogical framework, and the challenges inherent to a multidisciplinary, fully online course.

AB Use of audio visual tools to aid in medical education is ever on a rise. Our study intends to find the efficacy of a video prepared on "fatty liver," a topic that is often a challenge for pre-clinical teachers, in enhancing cognitive processing and ultimately learning. We prepared a video presentation of 11: 36 min, incorporating various concepts of the topic, while keeping in view Mayer's and Ellaway guidelines for multimedia presentation. A pre-post test study on subject knowledge was conducted for 100 students with the video shown as intervention. A retrospective pre study was conducted as a survey which inquired about students understanding of the key concepts of the topic and a feedback on our video was taken. Students performed significantly better in the post test (mean score 8.52 vs. 5.45 in pre-test), positively responded in the retrospective pre-test and gave a positive feedback for our video presentation. Well-designed multimedia tools can aid in cognitive processing and enhance working memory capacity as shown in our study. In times when "smart" device penetration is high, information and communication tools in medical education, which can act as essential aid and not as replacement for traditional curriculums, can be beneficial to the students.

AB The Rossmann fold is one of the most common and widely distributed super-secondary structures. It is composed of a series of alternating beta strand () and alpha helical () segments wherein the -strands are hydrogen bonded forming a -sheet. The initial beta-alpha-beta () fold is the most conserved segment of Rossmann folds. As this segment is in contact with the ADP portion of dinucleotides such as FAD, NAD, and NADP it is also called as an "ADP-binding fold". The Proteopedia entry on the Rossmann fold (Available at: ) was generated to illustrate several structural aspects of super families of FAD and NAD(P) binding proteins: (1) The coenzymes FAD and NAD(P) share the basic adenosine diphosphate (ADP) structure. (2) The fold motif that is common to both FAD and NAD(P) binding enzymes accommodates the common ADP component of these two coenzymes. (3) In both FAD and NAD(P) binding sites, the tight turn between the first -strand and the -helix is in contact with the two phosphate groups of ADP. (4) This hairpin curve includes the first two conserved glycines (Gly-x-Gly) that allow the sharp turn of the polypeptide backbone. (5) The two -strands of the fold may constitute the core of a larger -sheet that may include up to seven -strands generally in parallel orientation. (6) The structures of segments between additional strands vary greatly and may be composed of a variety of structures such as multiple short helices or coils.

AB Incorporating scientific literacy into inquiry driven research is one of the most effective mechanisms for developing an undergraduate student's strength in writing. Additionally, discovery-based laboratories help develop students who approach science as critical thinkers. Thus, a three-week laboratory module for an introductory cell and molecular biology course that couples inquiry-based experimental design with extensive scientific writing was designed at Westminster College to expose first year students to these concepts early in their undergraduate career. In the module students used scientific literature to design and then implement an experiment on the effect of cellular stress on protein expression in HeLa cells. In parallel the students developed a research paper in the style of the undergraduate journal BIOS to report their results. HeLa cells were used to integrate the research experience with the Westminster College Next Chapter first year program, in which the students explored the historical relevance of HeLa cells from a sociological perspective through reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. In this report I detail the design, delivery, student learning outcomes, and assessment of this module, and while this exercise was designed for an introductory course at a small primarily undergraduate institution, suggestions for modifications at larger universities or for upper division courses are included. Finally, based on student outcomes suggestions are provided for improving the module to enhance the link between teaching students skills in experimental design and execution with developing student skills in information literacy and writing.

AB Biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) students should demonstrate proficiency in the foundational concepts of the discipline and possess the skills needed to practice as professionals. To ascertain the skills that should be required, groups of BMB educators met in several focused workshops to discuss the expectations with the ultimate goal of clearly articulating the skills required. The results of these discussions highlight the critical importance of experimental, mathematical, and interpersonal skills including collaboration, teamwork, safety, and ethics. The groups also found experimental design, data interpretation and analysiand the ability to communicate findings to diverse audience to be essential skills. To aid in the development of appropriate assessments these skills are grouped into three categories, 1) Process of Science, 2) Communication and Comprehension of Science, and 3) Community of Practice Aspects of Science. Finally, the groups worked to align these competencies with the best practices in both teaching and in skills assessment.

DE Enzyme stereospecificity; demonstration; equilibrium thermodynamics
ID ASPARTAME
AB Enzyme stereospecificity and equilibrium thermodynamics can be demonstrated using the coupling of two amino acid derivatives by Thermoase C160. This protease will catalyze peptide bond formation between Z-L-AspOH and L-PheOMe to form the Aspartame precursor Z-L-Asp-L-PheOMe. Reaction completion manifests itself by precipitation of the product. As the product has almost zero solubility, the equilibrium favors condensation and thus a normally hydrolytic enzyme catalyzes the opposite reaction. Neither Z-D-AspOH with L-PheOMe nor Z-L-AspOH with D-PheOMe produces any visible product.

AB The development of classroom experiments where students examine their own DNA is frequently described as an innovative teaching practice. Often these experiences involve students analyzing their genes for various polymorphisms associated with disease states, like an increased risk for developing cancer. Such experiments can muddy the distinction between classroom investigation and medical testing. Although the goals and issues surrounding classroom genotyping do not directly align with those of clinical testing, instructors can use the guidelines and standards established by the medical genetics community when evaluating the ethics of human genotyping. We developed a laboratory investigation and discussion which allowed undergraduate science students to explore current DNA manipulation techniques to isolate their p53 gene, followed by a dialogue probing the ethical implications of examining their sample for various polymorphisms. Students never conducted genotyping on their samples because of the ethical concerns presented in this paper, so the discussion replaced the actual genetic testing in the class. A science faculty member led the laboratory portion, while a genetic counselor facilitated the discussion of the ethical concepts underlying genetic counseling: autonomy, beneficence, confidentiality, and justice. In their final papers, students demonstrated an understanding of the practice guidelines established by the genetics community and acknowledged the ethical considerations inherent in p53 genotyping. Given the burgeoning market for personalized medicine, teaching undergraduates about the psychosocial and ethical dimensions of human genetic testing is important and timely. Moreover, incorporating a genetic counselor in the classroom discussion provided a rich and dynamic discussion of human genetic testing.

AB This laboratory exercise is an inquiry-based investigation developed around the core experiment where students, working alone or in groups, each purify and analyze their own prescreened colored proteins using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Here, we present reagents and protocols that allow 12 different proteins to be purified in parallel without specialized equipment and within a 2.5- to 3-hour undergraduate teaching laboratory. The visual feedback of purifying a colored biomolecule provides real-time emphasis of the power and simplicity of recombinant DNA technology and IMAC. As presented here in its simplest form, this laboratory occupies two laboratory periods: purification followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. As such, it can be easily inserted into the existing curriculum of a Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, or even Genetics course to illustrate core concepts of central dogma and protein purification. Furthermore, the proteins in hand at the end of this 2-week module can also be used for follow-up experiments tailored to the needs, timeframe, and facilities available.

AB Student assessment is central to the educational process and can be used for multiple purposes including, to promote student learning, to grade student performance and to evaluate the educational quality of qualifications. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that assessment instruments are of a high quality. In this article, we present various tools that instructors could use, both to improve instrument design and validity before presentation to students and, to evaluate the reliability and quality of the assessment after students have answered the questions. In keeping with our goals of the Bridging-the-Gap series, we also present various ideas from the educational literature regarding the evaluation of assessment quality and end with a list of criteria that instructors could use to guide their evaluation process.

ID COMMUNITY; ADOPTION
AB We present as a case study the evolution of a series of participant-centered workshops designed to meet a need in the life sciences education community-the incorporation of best practices in the assessment of student learning. Initially, the ICABL (Inclusive Community for the Assessment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology/BMB Learning) project arose from a grass-roots effort to develop material for a national exam in biochemistry and molecular biology. ICABL has since evolved into a community of practice in which participants themselves-through extensive peer review and reflection-become integral stakeholders in the workshops. To examine this evolution, this case study begins with a pilot workshop supported by seed funding and thoughtful programmatic assessment, the results of which informed evidence-based changes that, in turn, led to an improved experience for the community. Using participant response data, the case study also reveals critical features for successful workshops, including participant-centered activities and the value of frequent peer review of participants' products. Furthermore, we outline a train-the-trainer model for creating a self-renewing community by bringing new perspectives and voices into an existing core leadership team. This case study, then, offers a blueprint for building a thriving, evolving community of practice that not only serves the needs of individual scientist-educators as they seek to enhance student learning, but also provides a pathway for elevating members to positions of leadership.

AB The present study was to teach metabolic syndrome (MetS) disease through a scenario developed according to the problem-based learning (PBL) approach in the biochemistry class. The study was designed as a single group pre-test and post-test research. The study group consisted of first-year students (N = 183) from the nursing department within the health sciences faculty of a state university in Turkey. The study findings indicated that PBL increased students' understanding and learning performances about MetS. It may be suggested that those learned by the scenario developed according to the PBL are effective in learning about the MetS.

AB The ability to analyze large data sets ("Big Data") is an increasingly important skill in modern science. In Biochemistry, the increased volume and velocity of data is particularly evident in the rapid expansion of biological databases. We present a modular bioinformatics course to survey the analysis of genomic data for advanced undergraduates. Research activities include genome scanning for endogenous retroviruses, annotating genomic sequences and a brief exploration of programming in R. A summative poster session was used to disseminate their work. This course is amenable to remote or online instruction. Supplemental materials provided include a schedule and outline. This article reports a session from the virtual international 2021 IUBMB/ASBMB workshop, "Teaching Science on Big Data."

AB This study aimed to investigate how international students enrolled on medical and surgical bachelor's degree programs (MBBS) in China perceived online medical education course, compared to native Chinese students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The perceptions of 38 MBBS and 31 Chinese sophomores were surveyed using the Chaoxing platform. The international student group's mean satisfaction with online teaching was 2.737 on a 5-point scale, much lower than the Chinese students' mean score of 4.355 (p < 0.05). Similarly, the international students expressed less satisfaction than the Chinese learners with other aspects of the course, including the teacher's level, at 3.964 +/- 0.818 versus 4.445 +/- 0.548 (p < 0.05); curriculum organization, at 3.651 +/- 0.848 versus 4.333 +/- 0.568 (p < 0.05); and self-learning level, at 3.634 +/- 0.996 versus 3.686 +/- 0.949 (p > 0.05), respectively. There were also noteworthy differences between the progress made by the international students in Chinese language learning, which was positively correlated with satisfaction with teaching on the online medical education (p < 0.05). The results suggest that, while online teaching was a necessary response to the Covid-19 pandemic, satisfaction with this mode of education is lower among international students than their Chinese counterparts.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the delivery of undergraduate courses around the world, and this was no different for the Biochemistry Capstone course offered to Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar's second year pre-medical students during the 2021 spring semester. The course, which was previously delivered in-person and offered an opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with research and laboratory techniques, had to be modified to be delivered online. The online delivery of the course mainly consisted of "Zoom" sessions, "Canvas" materials, and data analysis using Microsoft Excel raw data sheets. The final assessment of the course consisted of a research report encompassing the procedures discussed, the results of the literature search, and data analysis carried out for the duration of the course. At the end of the course, students completed a survey on the online delivery of the course. It was evident that the majority of students preferred either a combination of in-person and online delivery or in-person delivery only, rather than a fully online course. Students' feedback as well as other literature on the online delivery of courses were considered in order to potentially improve the course for the upcoming years.

AB Lack of motivation of students is a major concern for the instructors and administration in universities, and it is in their interest to address these issues in the most effective and efficient way. The purpose of this explanatory sequential mixed-method study is to examine the predictive power of the learning environment on student academic motivation and to learn students' opinions on this issue. One hundred twenty students enrolled at the Molecular Biology and Genetics program completed the Academic Motivation and Learning Environment Perception scales, Quantitative findings indicated that only the activities dimension of the learning environment has a predictive power on academic motivation. Focus group interviews conducted with 16 students validated the quantitative findings. Students particularly drew attention to activities that foster active participation in the learning process, emphasizing the vitality of being engaged and of having real-life experiences in their learning environment.

AB In this paper, we propose and describe a new approach, named BarcodingGO, to teach environmental DNA and bioinformatics concepts to undergraduate or graduate students in molecular biology-related fields. The learning pipeline proposed here aims to solve a simulated environmental monitoring problem, in which a biodiversity survey of a particular region is needed to assess the impact of an environmental disaster. Biological surveys, in the context of environmental DNA studies, are performed by analyzing the DNA released by organisms living in a specific environment. We proposed a scenario in which quick response (QR) codes represented a given environmental DNA, and they were positioned in a scattered pattern across two regions of the classroom (representing pre and post scenarios for a particular environmental disaster). The QR codes redirect to a page that contained a fictional representation of an animal or a plant. Students then survey the region's biodiversity using QR code scanning applications on their cell phones by "capturing" these organisms as an analogy to thePokemon GOgame of the internationalPokemonfranchise. We believe this method (or even an adaptation of it) can be an essential tool to engage students in molecular biology classes. Moreover, this approach can help to teach how modern genomics and bioinformatics tools can be applied to solve real problems in conservation biology.

AB The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for gene editing and it has become increasingly important for biology students to understand this emerging technique. Most CRISPR laboratory teaching modules use complex metazoan systems or mammalian cell culture which can be expensive. Here, we present a lab module that engages students in learning the fundamentals of CRISPR/Cas9 methodology using the simple and inexpensive model system, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Students use CRISPR/Cas9 and nonhomologous end joining to generate frameshift insertion and deletion mutations in the CAN1 gene, which are easily selected for using media plates that have canavanine. DNA sequencing is also performed to determine what type of mutation occurred in gene-edited cells. This easy to implement set of experiments has been run as both a 5-week and a shorter 3-week lab module. Learning assessments demonstrate increased understanding in CRISPR-related concepts as well as increased confidence using molecular techniques. Thus, this CRISPR/Cas9 lab module can be added to an existing Genetics, Microbiology, or Molecular Biology lab course to help undergraduate students learn current gene editing techniques with limited effort and cost.

AB This sequence of labs was developed for an upper level undergraduate cell biology course at Fairfield University. The labs are based on the use of the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line, a model system that is exceptionally amenable to an undergraduate cell biology lab course due to its ease of maintenance and propagation and usefulness for studies of growth, death, and differentiation. The sequence of labs is conducted over a 6-week period, following a series of weekly cell biology labs covering basic cell and molecular biology techniques. Together, the lab series has four primary objectives 1) to teach students how to culture and maintain mammalian cells; 2) to build student competency in standard cell biology techniques; 3) to demonstrate the role of growth factors on cell proliferation and viability; and 4) to provide students with an opportunity to use these cells in an independent investigation on cell differentiation. We provide examples of student data and offer a range of experimental measurements depending on institutional capacity and facilities. Our assessment data suggest that students find great value in this lab series, enhancing their comprehension of key concepts, acquisition of important lab skills, and depth of understanding of the research process.

AB Team based learning (TBL) is a time tested teaching-learning (T-L) tool involving collaborative learning but has hardly been tested for teaching clinical biochemistry to undergraduate medical students. The present study was designed to (a) compare problem solving skills of first year MBBS students after attending a TBL session on 'organ function test' with that of the students taught the same topic by didactic lecture, (b) assess their perception towards TBL and (c) evaluate if difference in academic standing and gender influence the learning outcome of TBL.One Hundred first professional MBBS students were divided by stratified randomization into two groups. Group I was exposed to TBL to teach 'organ function tests', while group II was taught the same topic by traditional lecture. The outcome of the T-L sessions was assessed by a test for problem solving skills. Student perception towards TBL was assessed from students' response to a questionnaire. No significant difference between the two groups in problem solving skills could be discerned. High achievers performed better after TBL session, while the low achievers were more benefited by traditional lecture method. The female students showed better academic performance after TBL in comparison to male students. The students gave positive feedback for TBL as an instructional technique. We conclude that TBL gives satisfaction, is not inferior to lecture in effectiveness and hence should be used as a T-L method for undergraduate medical students. Moreover, being more effective for female students and high achievers, it is judicious to utilize TBL more frequently for them in an attempt to provide the best individualized teaching.

ID PERSISTENCE
AB Lactase is the enzyme responsible for the digestion of the disaccharide lactose, and deficiency in this enzyme causes the prevalent medical condition lactose intolerance. Management of lactose intolerance can be achieved through the administration of lactase supplements. Lactase is an appropriate platform for advanced enzymatic study because its medical application is a motivator for student learning. The following is an upper-level biochemistry laboratory sequence that integrates student inquiry and exposure to advanced laboratory techniques. Students investigate three different lactase supplements through experimentation that includes the Bradford assay, SDS-PAGE, continuous and discontinuous kinetic assays, and zymography. Upon completion of this project, students compile their results and conclusions in a scientifically formatted paper comparing supplement protein content and activity. This safe and inexpensive laboratory project enriches student understanding of key biochemical concepts while mirroring work performed in a realistic research setting.

AB Modeling is a practice of science that is underemphasized in biology classrooms in comparison to its central focus in the physical sciences. Visualizations of the submicroscopic world of molecules are becoming increasingly sophisticated with the evolution of new technologies. With this in mind, we introduced high school biology classrooms to a professional molecular modeling software program used by research biochemists to visualize proteins and other macromolecules. Analysis of surveys completed before and after the use of the program revealed significant student gains in their understandings of the nature of models. Student and teacher perceptions of the program showed an appreciation for the real/authentic nature of the program, and its affordances when utilizing the three-dimensional rendering of proteins. The teachers did report a general level of frustration regarding their lack of experience with the program and their inability to unlock its full potential due to not being able to access all of the program's features. However, we believe that the evidence at hand indicates that the value of introducing students to authentic molecular modeling tools in high school science classrooms outweighs the potential limitations.

AB The development and evaluation of a 6-hours laboratory class, based on capillary electrophoresis (CE) and the detection of microbial contaminants, is described. It can be easily scaled up or down, to suit class sizes up to 188 and completed in a shorter time scale. CE uses narrow-bore fused-silica capillaries to separate a complex array of large and small molecules. A laboratory exercise has been devised to illustrate how CE-based genetic analysis system processes DNA fragment analysis to detect three microbial contaminants. The protocol is relatively inexpensive and uses standard molecular biology reagents and equipment. (c) 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(3):279-284, 2018.

AB Traditional developmental biology laboratory classes have utilized a number of different model organisms to allow students to be exposed to diverse biological phenomena in developing organisms. This traditional approach has mainly focused on the diverse morphological and anatomical descriptions of the developing organisms. However, modern developmental biology is focusing more on conserved genetic networks which are responsible for generating conserved body patterns in developing organisms. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new pedagogical tool to educate undergraduate biology students in the laboratory class of developmental biology with the genetic principles which are responsible for generating and controlling the developing body patterns. A new undergraduate laboratory class for developmental biology was developed in order to offer students the opportunity to explore a wide range of experimental procedures, also incorporating the instructor's on-going research. Thereby the course can serve as a bridge between research and education by combining both into a single theme. The course design involves a sequence of exercises which can be easily adapted to the faculty's ongoing research. This style of laboratory coursework could be a transitional form between a regular laboratory course and a discovery-based laboratory course.

AB An important aim of undergraduate science education is to develop student skills in reading and evaluating research papers. We have designed, developed, and implemented an on-line interactive resource entitled "Evaluating Scientific Research literature" (ESRL) aimed at students from the first 2 years of the undergraduate program. In this article, we describe the resource, then use student data collected from questionnaire surveys to evaluate the resource within 2 years of its launch. Our results add to those reported previously and indicate that ESRL can enable students to start evaluating research articles when used during their undergraduate program. We conclude maximal learning is likely to occur when the resource can be embedded in the curriculum such that students have a clearly articulated context for the resource's activities, can see their relevance in relation to assessed assignments and can be encouraged to think deeply about the activities in conversation with one another and/or with staff.

AB To foster the connection between biochemistry and the supporting prerequisite concepts, a collection of activities that explicitly link general and organic chemistry concepts to biochemistry ideas was written and either assigned as pre-class work or as recitation activities. We assessed student learning gains after using these activities alone, or in combination with regularly-integrated clicker and discussion questions. Learning gains were determined from student performance on pre-and post-tests covering key prerequisite concepts, biochemistry course exams, and stu-dent self-evaluation. Long-term retention of the material was assessed using a comprehensive exam given to a subset of the students. Our results show that using the preclass exercises in combination with integrative questions was effective at improving student performance in both the short and long term. Similar results were obtained at both a large research institution with large class enrollments and at a private liberal arts college with moderate enrollments.

AB Among recent high profile scientific debates was the proposal that life could exist with arsenic in place of phosphorous in its nucleic acids and other biomolecules. Soon after its initial publication, scientists across diverse disciplines began to question this extraordinary claim. Using the original article, its claims, its scientific support, and the ensuing counterarguments, a two-day, active learning classroom exercise was developed focusing on the presentation, evaluation, and discussion of scientific argumentation and discourse. In this culminating assignment of a first semester biochemistry course, undergraduate students analyze the scientific support from the original research articles and then present and discuss multiple scientific rebuttals in a lively, civil classroom debate. Through this assignment, students develop a sense of skepticism, especially for the original arsenic-based life claims, and learn to clearly articulate their counterarguments with scientific support and critical reasoning. With its direct integration into first-semester biochemistry curriculum and the excitement surrounding arsenic based life, this assignment provides a robust, simple, and stimulating framework for introducing scientific discourse and active learning into the undergraduate molecular science curriculum.

AB Visualization of chemical concepts can be challenging for many students. This is arguably a critical skill for beginning students of biochemistry to develop, since new information is often presented visually in the form of textbook figures. It is recommended that visual literacy be explicitly taught in the classroom rather than assuming that students will develop this skill on their own. The activity described here is designed to assist students in their development of understanding of basic representations of protein three-dimensional structure as well as various types of ligands (small molecules, ions) through the use of the iPad application PyMOL. It has been used as a laboratory exercise but can also be used in a typical 50-minute class period with a portion of the activity assigned as homework.

AB Vision and Change [AAAS, 2011] outlines a blueprint for modernizing biology education by addressing conceptual understanding of key concepts, such as the relationship between structure and function. The document also highlights skills necessary for student success in 21st century Biology, such as the use of modeling and simulation. Here we describe a laboratory activity that allows students to investigate the dynamic nature of protein structure and function through the use of a modeling technique known as molecular dynamics (MD). The activity takes place over two lab periods that are 3 hr each. The first lab period unpacks the basic approach behind MD simulations, beginning with the kinematic equations that all bioscience students learn in an introductory physics course. During this period students are taught rudimentary programming skills in Python while guided through simple modeling exercises that lead up to the simulation of the motion of a single atom. In the second lab period students extend concepts learned in the first period to develop skills in the use of expert MD software. Here students simulate and analyze changes in protein conformation resulting from temperature change, solvation, and phosphorylation. The article will describe how these activities can be carried out using free software packages, including Abalone and VMD/NAMD.

AB We evaluate a new approach to teaching the basic biochemistry mechanisms that regulate the biology of Triatominae, major vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. We have designed and used a comic book, "Carlos Chagas: 100 years after a hero's discovery" containing scientific information obtained by seven distinguished contemporary Brazilian researchers working with Triatominaes. Students (22) in the seventh grade of a public elementary school received the comic book. The study was then followed up by the use of Concept Maps elaborated by the students. Six Concept Maps elaborated by the students before the introduction of the comic book received an average score of 7. Scores rose to an average of 45 after the introduction of the comic book. This result suggests that a more attractive content can greatly improve the knowledge and conceptual understanding among students not previously exposed to insect biochemistry. In conclusion, this study illustrates an alternative to current strategies of teaching about the transmission of neglected diseases. It also promotes the diffusion of the scientific knowledge produced by Brazilian researchers that may stimulate students to choose a scientific career.

AB As immunology continues to evolve, many educational methods have found difficulty in conveying the degree of complexity inherent in its basic principles. Today, the teaching-learning process in such areas has been improved with tools such as educational software. This article introduces Virtual Immunology, a software program available free of charge in Portuguese and English, which can be used by teachers and students in physiology, immunology, and cellular biology classes. We discuss the development of the initial two modules: Organs and Lymphoid Tissues and Inflammation and the use of interactive activities to provide microscopic and macroscopic understanding in immunology. Students, both graduate and undergraduate, were questioned along with university level professors about the quality of the software and intuitiveness of use, facility of navigation, and aesthetic organization using a Likert scale. An overwhelmingly satisfactory result was obtained with both students and immunology teachers. Programs such as Virtual Immunology are offering more interactive, multimedia approaches to complex scientific principles that increase student motivation, interest, and comprehension.

AB This study used a mixed methods approach to evaluate hybrid peer-assisted learning approaches incorporated into a bioinformatics tutorial for a genome annotation research project. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from undergraduates who enrolled in a research-based laboratory course during two different academic terms at UCLA. Findings indicate that a critical feature of the peer-assisted learning approach is to have near-peer leaders with genome annotation experience, allowing them to communicate technical and conceptual aspects of the process in the context of a research project (a.k.a., the big picture). These characteristics are important for creating connections between the wet lab experiments and the computer lab activities, engendering excitement about the research project and fostering engagement in bioinformatics as a discipline. Likewise, it is essential to couple tutorial training in genome annotation with appropriate instructional materials, providing detailed, step-by-step instructions for database navigation. Finally, the assessment results support this hybrid peer-assisted learning approach as a model for undergraduates to successfully learn bioinformatics in a course setting.

AB Western blot analysis, commonly known as "Western blotting," is a standard tool in every laboratory where proteins are analyzed. It involves the separation of polypeptides in polyacrylamide gels followed by the electrophoretic transfer of the separated polypeptides onto a nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. A replica of the separated polypeptides from the gel is created on the membrane, which is then probed with antibodies or other ligands to identify specific polypeptide(s). Here, we report an undergraduate laboratory exercise involving Western blotting. During the 3-week laboratory exercise, students investigated the likelihood of the presence of a serum albumin in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) homogenate, bovine calf serum (BCS), and fetal bovine serum (FBS). Students isolate proteins from fruit fly larvae and perform sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electrophoretic blotting, and immunoassay comparing those proteins with BCS and FBS proteins. Their results indicate that serum albumin is present in BCS and FBS but is absent in fruit flies. In the process, the specificity and sensitivity of Western blot analysis is demonstrated. The laboratory exercise can be easily incorporated into any college-level biochemistry or molecular techniques laboratory. The procedure used can be easily adapted to study other proteins.

AB Content and emphases in undergraduate biochemistry courses can be readily tailored to accommodate the standards of the department in which they are housed, as well as the backgrounds of the students in the courses. A more challenging issue is how to construct laboratory experiences for a class with both chemistry majors, who usually have little or no experience with biochemical techniques and biology and biochemistry majors who do. This manuscript describes a strategy for differentiating biochemistry labs to meet the needs of students with differing backgrounds.

AB This work describes the use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) applied to the biochemistry class for undergraduate, first-year medical students at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The course focused on the integration of energy metabolism, exploring metabolic adaptations in different physiological or pathological states such as starvation, diabetes, and exercise. The VLE was designed to combine online activities with traditional course content and presented guided inquiry-based activities to assist in the use of original scientific articles as educational resources. Based on the analysis of a semi-open questionnaire, the results provided evidence that the VLE encouraged students' engagement in activities and improved feedback. The results also suggested that guided inquiry-based activities were an effective way to stimulate students to critically read relevant scientific articles and to acquire skills to build and contextualize their knowledge through content association. In addition, most of the students involved in this experience considered the use of these resources important to become familiar with scientific language and to learn how to obtain up-to-date scientific information during their professional life.

AB Here, we propose a laboratory exercise to quickly determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) genes involved in alcohol metabolism. In this exercise, two different genotyping methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), namely allele-specific (AS) PCR and a PCR-restriction fragment polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, can be performed under the same PCR program (2-step x 35 cycles, 35 min total) in parallel using a hair root lysate as a template. In AS-PCR, the target regions of the G- or A-alleles of both genes are allele-specifically amplified in a single PCR tube. In the PCR-RFLP analysis, the two genes are amplified simultaneously in a single tube, and then a portion of the PCR product is double-digested with restriction enzymes MslI and Eam1104I for 5 min. The resulting reaction products of each method are electrophoresed side by side, and the genotypes are determined from the DNA band patterns. With the optimized protocol, the whole process from template preparation to genotyping can be completed in about 75 min. During PCR, students also perform an ethanol patch test to estimate their ability to metabolize alcohol. This series of experiments can help students learn the principles and applications of PCR/SNP analyses. By comparing the genotypes revealed by PCR and the phenotypes revealed by the patch tests, students can gain a better understanding of the clinical value of genetic testing.

AB The number of undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds enrolled in science and technology-related courses has increased over the past 20 years, but these students' persistence in STEM majors until graduation still lags behind the overall college population. Interventions like exposure to independent research, instruction using active learning, and connection within a scientific community have been shown to increase persistence and the development of science identity, especially for underrepresented minority students (URM), students with high financial need, and first-generation college students. However, exposure to research for introductory students can be expensive or challenging for an institution to provide and for some students to access. We designed Wintersession Research Week as a remotely taught, collaborative introduction to independent research for beginning undergraduate students, prioritizing those traditionally underrepresented in STEM (low income, first generation, and URM students). Because this program utilized graduate students as research mentors, we also provided training and mentoring to develop the next generation of science faculty. We found that the program helped undergraduate student participants to develop a scientific identity and increase confidence in their skills, and that graduate students found the experience valuable for their future teaching. We believe that elements of this program are adaptable to both virtual and in-person settings as an introduction to research, mentorship, and teaching for students and mentors.

AB An understanding of structure-function relationships in proteins is essential for modern biochemical studies. The integration of common freely accessible bioinformatics tools available online with the knowledge of protein-engineering tools provide a fundamental understanding of the application of protein structure-function for biochemical research. In order for students to apply their prior knowledge of recombinant protein technology into the understanding of protein structure-function relationships, we developed a semester-long project-oriented biochemistry laboratory experience that is the second laboratory course of a series. For easier integration of knowledge and application, we organized this course into four sequential modules: protein structure visualization/modification, mutagenesis target identification, site-directed mutagenesis, and mutant protein expression, purification, and characterization. These tasks were performed on the protein small laccase (SLAC) that was cloned and characterized by students in the previous semester during the first biochemistry laboratory course of the series. This goal-oriented project-based approach helped students apply their prior knowledge to newly introduced techniques to understand protein structure-function relationships in this research-like laboratory setting. A student assessment before and after the course demonstrated an overall increase in learning and enthusiasm for this topic.

AB Several predominant themes have emerged during the COVID-19 global pandemic that intersect with the nature and process of science. This paper identifies three such themes and briefly explores how they can be used as case studies and narrative cornerstones in teaching and learning. The themes include: (1) the understanding that science is cumulative and ever-changing, meaning that new findings may cause us to reconsider previous understandings; (2) the importance of citation tracking in the process of science; and (3) the need for accessible and purposeful science communication.

AB The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a promising drug target due to its functional role as a catalytic dyad in mediating proteolysis during the viral life cycle. In this study, experimentally proven 14 HIV protease peptides were screened against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Fourteen middle and high school "student researchers" were trained on relevant computational tools, provided with necessary biological and chemical background and scientific article writing. They performed the primary screening via molecular docking and the best performing complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular docking revealed that HIP82 and HIP1079 can bind with the catalytic residues, however after molecular dynamics simulation only HIP1079 retained its interaction with the catalytic sites. The student researchers were also trained to write scientific article and were involved with drafting of the manuscript. This project provided the student researchers an insight into multi-disciplinary research in biology and chemistry, inspired them about practical approaches of computational chemistry in solving a real-world problem like a global pandemic. This project also serves as an example to introduce scientific inquiry, research methodology, critical thinking, scientific writing, and communication for high school students.

AB Real-time quantitative PCR is a technique used to monitor the PCR reaction in real time. RT-qPCR is broadly classified into two types based on its purpose: absolute and relative quantification. Absolute quantification is used in a wide array of fields such as microbiology, food technology, and biotechnology to quantify the microbiological load/adulterants in a commodity/copy numbers respectively, whereas Relative quantification is used in the field of genomics and functional transcriptomics to perform gene expression analysis in biological experiments. A laboratory work that covers the basic principles involved in RT-qPCR and data analysis using the manual as well as the software methods are incorporated. The laboratory experiment was designed to provide insights on certain important principles such as primer characteristics, PCR efficiency, and melt curve analysis. This laboratory exercise provides all the significant components of RT-qPCR, which can be useful while performing an experiment in an undergraduate and graduate laboratory.

AB Many universities resort to online teaching due to COVID-19 pandemic. It is a challenging endeavor, especially in Molecular Biology courses that require lab access. Mock grant application roleplay is one alternative to lab-based activities. Students are engaged in three aspects: (i) targeted literature review, (ii) research proposal writing and (iii) 5-min project pitching. The design of this module is flexible and, other lab-based courses can adopt it. This module encourages undergraduate students to explore the lab techniques they learnt and concisely present their research proposal.

AB Molecular biology is a very important basic course for undergraduates major in pharmacy. During the novel coronavirus epidemic, we first adopted an online teaching of molecular biology course with rain class and tencent meeting for undergraduates major in pharmacy, following a blended teaching mode. Finally, we evaluated the effect of this special-time teaching by analyzing the anonymous questionnaire and final examination scores. Student feedback showed that most of students were satisfied with this online teaching, classroom teaching, and experimental teaching, and considered that postlecture quizzes were very helpful for their study. The majority of students supported that classroom teaching should be integrated with online teaching. Analysis of final examination scores showed that the effect of 2020-year teaching was not worse than that of 2019-year teaching, but even better in the excellence rate and rate of poor and failure. Here, we share the experience and thinking of blended teaching of medical molecular biology course during the novel coronavirus epidemic, and hope it helpful for other teachers' teaching.

AB Undergraduate biology laboratories emphasize hands-on skills. Typically, descriptions of manual techniques are delivered via written instruction. Custom-produced prelab instructional videos, which augment prelab instruction, have come into wider use in recent years. However, institutional and economic barriers can interfere with video production at all colleges and universities. In such cases, professionally produced laboratory instructional videos provide an attractive alternative. We hypothesized that students who watch short, professionally produced instructional videos before performing a laboratory would feel more confident and achieve greater learning gains than students whose prelab instruction was limited to handouts. For this proof of concept study, we investigated the value added when students watched a brief video, twice per lab, in an intermediate molecular biology course at a small, liberal arts university, and in a nonmajors biology course at a large, public research university. Both video and nonvideo comparison groups were administered a pre- and postlab exams. A postlab self-efficacy survey was also administered to video groups. Our results reveal that in three out of the four laboratory classes, students who watched professional instruction videos performed significantly better in both pre- and postlab exams. For these students, we observed up to a two-fold increase in test scores on scientific concepts and techniques. For all classes, most of the video group students reported that the video contributed to their confidence, comprehension of concepts, and understanding of how to conduct the lab. We conclude that professional instructional videos may address production barriers and have the potential to effectively enhance undergraduate science curricula and significantly improve students' performance.

AB The COVID-19 outbreak has shut down universities, and teaching faculty have moved to online classrooms to address students. This change has been supported by numerous online teaching tools and development of virtual classrooms. Undergraduate research programs in the sciences and biochemistry/molecular biology teaching labs, however, are affected by this change due to inaccessibility to laboratories. This communication outlines three concepts to engage undergraduate students who are involved in research: (a) remote data analysis, (b) literature review and science writing, and (c) science journal clubs.

ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES; PROJECT; ENZYME
AB Enzyme purification, characterization, and identification are some of the best ways to introduce undergraduate students to many aspects of biochemistry, particularly as part of project-based learning (PBL). These kinds of multi-step laboratory experiments not only help students to better understand basic biochemistry concepts but also serve to introduce them to the scaffolded nature of the research environment. A 13-week enzyme-based laboratory project was designed as one of three components associated with the course titled Capstone Laboratory, which is delivered to second-year undergraduate students at Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar (WCM-Q). The project incorporated several fundamental biochemical laboratory techniques, such as chromatography, centrifugation, spectrophotometry, electrophoresis, and kinetic assays, as well as enzyme inhibition and bioinformatic exercises. The aims of the project were to first purify, then to quantify, and finally to study a particular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme extracted from different chicken organs. LDH was selected for investigation because its inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Students enrolled in the Capstone Laboratory course were divided into three groups. Each group conducted experiments associated with one of the project's three aims over consecutive 3-week periods. Relevant data and materials were passed from one group to the next, with individual students writing reports describing the results from their respective collection of experiments. Students in the third and final group gave presentations summarizing the results of the overall project. In the associated bioinformatic exercises, students assessed the similarities and differences between chicken-sourced and human-sourced LDH as well as the interaction between the LDH enzyme and the inhibitors. This PBL in biochemistry is a successful addition to the WCM-Q premedical curriculum because (a) it affords the second-year premedical students opportunities to improve and develop content knowledge and technical and communication skills, and also (b) it provides an opportunity to engage many of the undergraduate students in research.

AB Accreditation of academic programs and recognition of student degrees provide academic institutions a measure of a set of community agreed upon standards. These can aid pedagogical change, support faculty to successfully engage students in their discipline and to provide a mechanism to maintain standards. Several professional scientific societies from engineering, chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biology have developed standards by which departments can be recognized for accreditation. As one of the members of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology who helped develop the accreditation and standardized exams and a committee member of the American Chemical Society's Committee on Professional Training I will present the evolution of the accreditation process, discuss the benefits and challenges with being an accreditation. How these programs serve their communities and at times can hinder or be used to support potential creativity and teaching pedagogies will also be discussed.

DE hormones; molecular mechanism; nuclear receptors
AB Hormones are the major signaling molecules that have a complex signaling cascade involving intracellular and intranuclear receptors, coreceptors, and signal transduction pathways. The molecular mechanism of hormonal action is written in a poetic verse to kindle the interest of students and to augment their affinity toward the onerous yet awesome topic. The hormones are secreted from the site of their synthesis and carried by transport binding proteins to exert their action in their target cells at a different site. Cortisol and aldosterone are derived from cholesterol with pregnenolone as an intermediate. Cortisol binds to the Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the cytoplasm by displacing the heat shock protein (hsp) already bound to it. The receptor ligand complex then traverses the nuclear membrane and binds to the Glucocorticoid Responsive Element (GRE) in the DNA. Except the orphan receptors, the nuclear receptors of thyroid, retinol (Vitamin A) and calcitriol (Vitamin D) exist as heterodimers and are bound to the DNA by their DNA binding domains. These nuclear receptors exist as heterodimers partnered with RXR (retinoic x receptor). Binding of insulin to its receptor on the target cells results in a cascade of intracellular events that involves activation of various kinases like PDK, mTOR and MAPK. This leads to phosphorylation of signal molecules that mediates the actions of insulin. Somatotropin (Growth hormone) and prolactin acts by JAK-STAT pathway where the phosphorylated STAT protein dimerises and translocates to the nucleus and binds to Interferon Responsive Element and activates transcription. Somatotropin prevents dwarfism by promoting growth and prolactin promotes synthesis of milk by mammary glands. The communication between the nuclear receptors (FXR, LXR, PPAR-Gamma) and the basal transcription apparatus is accomplished by protein - protein interaction between the nuclear receptors and the nuclear coregulators like CREB, TRAP and DRIP. These coregulators bind to various coactivators and transcription factors that activate RNA polymerase resulting in the synthesis of Pre-pri RNA strand. Hence hormones act as first messengers that initiates the expression of genetic message in the codon of genes as protein synthesis by a process of translation.

AB Enzyme kinetics is the study of enzymatic catalytic rates in biochemical reactions. This topic is commonly taught to life science students in introductory biochemistry courses during their undergraduate education. Unlike most other biochemistry topics, which focus on visual structures of biomolecules and their processes, enzyme kinetics is explained primarily through abstract mathematical and two-dimensional graphical plots. However, these abstract/symbolic representations often make it difficult for students to relate the kinetic parameters to the underlying molecular system that is being described. In this article, we present the design and development of a web-based multimedia interactive learning tool, biomolecular interactive tutorials (BIOMINT) to help students better bridge the relationships between these abstract mathematical models and the molecular behaviors, interactions, and dynamics that produce kinetic phenomena. This learning tool can be accessed at . (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2019.

AB The development of new medicines holds particular fascination for chemistry, biochemistry, and biology students interested in a career in medicine or the life sciences. The identification and refinement of lead compounds to treat diseases requires researchers to be facile in a number of different disciplines including organic synthesis, biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology. We have developed an interdisciplinary, inquiry-based laboratory spanning both organic chemistry and biochemistry classes that acquaints students with research in medicinal chemistry. The first part of the exercise takes place in the second semester of organic chemistry, where pairs of students design and execute their own multistep synthesis of a novel compound with anti-inflammatory and/or antimalarial potential. Later, in first semester biochemistry, many of the same students then test these synthesized compounds for cytotoxicity, inhibition of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB. Learning outcomes, measured by the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) survey, suggest that students participating in both classes had higher gains than an average student.

AB In the past ten years, increasing evidence has demonstrated that scientific teaching and active learning improve student retention and learning gains in the sciences. Graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), who play an important role in undergraduate education at many universities, require training in these methods to encourage implementation, long-term adoption, and advocacy. Here, we describe the design and evaluation of a two-day training workshop for first-year GTAs in the life sciences. This workshop combines instruction in current research and theory supporting teaching science through active learning as well as opportunities for participants to practice teaching and receive feedback from peers and mentors. Postworkshop assessments indicated that GTA participants' knowledge of key topics increased during the workshop. In follow-up evaluations, participants reported that the workshop helped them prepare for teaching. This workshop design can easily be adapted to a wide range of science disciplines. Overall, the workshop prepares graduate students to engage, include, and support undergraduates from a variety of backgrounds when teaching in the sciences.

DE Critical reading; scientific writing; journal club; seminar
AB As future scientists, university students need to learn how to avoid making errors in their own manuscripts, as well as how to identify flaws in papers published by their peers. Here we describe a novel approach on how to promote students' ability to critically evaluate scientific articles. The exercise is based on instructing teams of students to write intentionally flawed manuscripts describing the results of simple experiments. The teams are supervised by instructors advising the students during manuscript writing, choosing the 'appropriate' errors, monitoring the identification of errors made by the other team and evaluating the strength of their arguments in support of the identified errors. We have compared the effectiveness of the method with a journal club-type seminar. Based on the results of our assessment we propose that the described seminar may effectively complement the existing approaches to teach critical scientific thinking.

AB Here, we present a 10-week project-oriented laboratory module designed to provide a course-based undergraduate research experience in biochemistry that emphasizes the importance of biomolecular structure and dynamics in enzyme function. This module explores the impact of mutagenesis on an important active site loop for a biomedically-relevant human enzyme, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Over the course of the semester students guide their own mutant of PTP1B from conception to characterization in a cost-effective manner and gain exposure to fundamental techniques in biochemistry, including site-directed DNA mutagenesis, bacterial recombinant protein expression, affinity column purification, protein quantitation, SDS-PAGE, and enzyme kinetics. This project-based approach allows an instructor to simulate a research setting and prepare students for productive research beyond the classroom. Potential modifications to expand or contract this module are also provided. (c) 2017 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 45(5):403-410, 2017.

AB This study aims to investigate the impacts of a digital learning module with guided peer feedback on students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change in the field of biotechnology and molecular life sciences. The extent to which the use of this module is appreciated by students is studied as well. A pre-test, post-test design was used with 203 students who were randomly assigned to groups of three. They were asked to work on the digital module with the aim of exploring various perspectives, and the pros and cons on the topic of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). The results suggest that the module can be used to foster students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change. Furthermore, the module was evaluated positively in terms of students' motivation and satisfaction with the learning experiences.

AB Vertical integration has been extensively implemented across medical school curricula but has not been widely attempted in the field of biochemistry. We describe a novel curricular innovation in which a near-peer learning model was used to implement vertical integration in our medical school biochemistry course. Senior medical students developed and facilitated a case-based small group session for first year biochemistry students. Students were surveyed before and after the session on their attitudes about biochemistry, as well as the effectiveness of the session. Prior to the session, the students believed biochemistry was more important to understanding the basic science of medicine than it was to understanding clinical medicine or becoming a good physician. The session improved students' attitudes about the importance of biochemistry in clinical medicine, and after the session they now believe that understanding biochemistry is equally important to the basic sciences as clinical medicine. Students would like more sessions and believe the senior student facilitators were knowledgeable and effective teachers. The facilitators believe they improved their teaching skills. This novel combination of near-peer learning and vertical integration in biochemistry provided great benefit to both first year and senior medical students, and can serve as a model for other institutions.

AB The Human Genome Project (HGP) was initiated in 1990 and completed in 2003. It aimed to sequence the whole human genome. Although it represented an advance in understanding the human genome and its complexity, many questions remained unanswered. Other projects were launched in order to unravel the mysteries of our genome, including the ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). This review aims to analyze the evolution of scientific knowledge related to both the HGP and ENCODE projects. Data were retrieved from scientific articles published in 1990-2014, a period comprising the development and the 10 years following the HGP completion. The fact that only 20,000 genes are protein and RNA-coding is one of the most striking HGP results. A new concept about the organization of genome arose. The ENCODE project was initiated in 2003 and targeted to map the functional elements of the human genome. This project revealed that the human genome is pervasively transcribed. Therefore, it was determined that a large part of the non-protein coding regions are functional. Finally, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure emerged. The mechanistic functioning of the genome has been redrafted, revealing a much more complex picture. Besides, a gene-centric conception of the organism has to be reviewed. A number of criticisms have emerged against the ENCODE project approaches, raising the question of whether non-conserved but biochemically active regions are truly functional. Thus, HGP and ENCODE projects accomplished a great map of the human genome, but the data generated still requires further in depth analysis.

AB Biochemistry courses in the Department of Molecular Biology at the National University of Rio Cuarto, Argentina, are designed for undergraduate students in biology, microbiology, chemistry, agronomy, and veterinary medicine. Microbiology students typically have previous coursework in general, analytical, and organic chemistry. Programmed sequences of lab experiments allow these students to investigate biochemical problems whose solution is feasible within the context of their knowledge and experience. We previously designed and reported a programmed lab experiment that familiarizes microbiology students with techniques for detection and characterization of quorum-sensing (QS) and quorum-quenching (QQ) signal molecules. Here, we describe a sequence of experiments designed to expand the understanding and capabilities of biochemistry students using techniques for extraction and identification of QS and QQ signal molecules from peanut rhizospheric soil bacteria, including culturing and manipulation of bacteria under sterile conditions. The program provides students with an opportunity to perform useful assays, draw conclusions from their results, and discuss possible extensions of the study.

AB The ability of students to understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype, and the mechanisms by which genotypes and phenotypes can change is essential for students studying genetics. To this end, we have developed a four-week laboratory called Blue Genes, which is designed to help novice students discriminate between two mechanisms by which the genetic material can be altered: genetic transformation and gene mutation. In the first week of the laboratory, students incubate a plasmid DNA with calcium chloride-treated Escherichia coli JM109 cells and observe a phenotype change from ampicillin sensitive to ampicillin resistant and from white color to blue color on plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Over the course of the next three weeks, students use a battery of approaches including plasmid DNA isolation experiments, restriction maps, and PCR to differentiate between mutation and transformation. The students ultimately come to the conclusion that the changes in phenotypes are due to genetic transformation and not mutation based on the evidence generated over the four-week period. Pre-laboratory tests and post-laboratory tests indicate that this set of exercises is successful in helping students differentiate between transformation and mutation. The laboratory is designed for underclassmen and is a good prerequisite for an apprentice-based research opportunity, although it is not designed as a class based research experience. Potential modifications and future directions of the laboratory based upon student experiences and assessment are presented.

AB Most students enroll in general education introductory nutrition classes because they want to improve their diets in order to lose weight or enhance athletic performance. These nonscience majors are often less interested in learning about the fundamental biochemical principles underlying nutrition or are surprised that this foundational knowledge of biochemistry is essential for appropriate diet planning. Furthermore, nonscience majors sometimes find traditional, lecture-oriented science classes that encourage competition rather than collaboration to be uninviting and unappealing. For these reasons, we have developed a set of guided inquiry activities about macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) for use in introductory nutrition courses for nonscience majors. In our first study (Spring 2012), we divided students into two groups with two different approaches for learning about the macronutrients: (1) a traditional, lecture-based approach and (2) an active learning approach with guided inquiry activities. We showed through the use of embedded common exam questions that students mastered concepts related to the macronutrients equally well using either approach. Due to positive student and faculty feedback from the first study, we decided to have all students use the guided inquiry approach in a subsequent study the following year (Spring 2013). In our second study we used pre/post survey data to evaluate both students' concept mastery and confidence in answering questions about the macro-and micronutrients. We found that (1) students showed gains in both concept mastery and confidence and (2) as students' confidence increased, post-test concept scores also increased.

AB The TAS2R38 alleles that code for the PAV/AVI T2R38 proteins have long been viewed as benign taste receptor variants. However, recent studies have demonstrated an expanding and medically relevant role for TAS2R38. The AVI variant of T2R38 is associated with an increased risk of both colorectal cancer and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-associated sinus infection and T2R38 variants have been implicated in off-target drug responses. To address ethical concerns associated with continued student TAS2R38 gene testing, we developed an alternative to the traditional laboratory genotyping exercise. Instead of determining their own genotype, introductory level students isolated plasmid DNA containing a section of the human TAS2R38 gene from Escherichia coli. Following PCR-mediated amplification of a section of the TAS2R38 gene spanning the SNP at position 785, students determined their assigned genotype by restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. Using the course wide genotype and phenotype data, students found that there was an association between TAS2R38 genotype and the age of persistent P. aeruginosa acquisition in cystic fibrosis patients. Assessment data demonstrated that students taking part in this new TAS2R38 laboratory activity made clear learning gains.

AB Research shows that computer animations are especially helpful in fields such as chemistry and in this mixed-methods study, we investigate the educational effectiveness of Bio-Organic Reaction Animations (BioORA), a 3-D software, in four undergraduate biochemistry classes at different universities. Statistically significant findings indicate that students performed better on a quiz completed after a lesson with BioORA than after a lesson with regular teaching methods in three out of four classes. Ratings on several survey items completed after experiencing BioORA, including items related to interest, value, and ability, were higher in two classes. Surveys and one-on-one interviews reveal instructor and student experiences with the software as well as the utility of various software features, which can be adopted in other programs. Instructors and students provide suggestions to maximize BioORA's benefits as an educational tool and findings suggest the importance of multiple forms of information to enhance student understanding and reach students with various learning preferences.

AB Formative assessment has long been identified as a critical element to teaching for conceptual development in science. It is therefore important for university instructors to have an arsenal of formative assessment tools at their disposal which enable them to effectively uncover and diagnose all students' thinking, not just the most vocal or assertive. We illustrate the utility of one type of formative assessment prompt (reading question assignment) in producing high-quality evidence of student thinking (student-generated reading questions). Specifically, we characterized student assessment data using three distinct analytic frames to exemplify their effectiveness in diagnosing student learning in relationship to three sample learning outcomes. Our data will be useful for university faculty, particularly those engaged in teaching upper-level biochemistry courses and their prerequisites, as they provide an alternative mechanism for uncovering and diagnosing student understanding.

ID INTRODUCING STUDENTS
AB Encouraging undergraduate students to access, read, and analyze current primary literature can positively impact learning, especially in advanced courses. The incorporation of literature into coursework typically involves reading and responding to full research reports. Such exercises have clear value as students make connections between experiments and are able to probe and critique scientific logic. The exclusive use of full papers, though, may reinforce certain students' tendencies to rely on textual clues rather than a critical analysis of the actual data presented. I propose that structured activities requiring students to focus on individual parts of research papers, even on a single figure, are beneficial in a literature-centered advanced undergraduate course, because they promote the deep reading that is critical to scientific discourse. In addition, I describe how one such focused assignment boosted learning and was well received by students in a second-semester biochemistry course.

AB The principles of biochemistry are core to understanding cellular and tissue function, as well as the pathophysiology of disease. However, the clinical utility of biochemical principles is often obscure to clinical trainees. Resident's Morning Report is a common teaching conference in which residents present clinical cases of interest to a faculty member for discussion. This venue provides an opportunity to illustrate how basic biomedical principles facilitate an understanding of the clinical presentation, the relevant pathophysiology, and the rationale for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. A discussion of biochemical principles can easily be incorporated into these case discussions, with the potential to reinforce these concepts and to illustrate their application to clinical decision making. This approach maintains the effort to teach basic biomedical sciences in the context of clinical application across the educational continuum.

ID SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; CAPACITY; ASSAYS; POWER
AB This exercise is intended to introduce undergraduate biochemistry students to the analysis of antioxidants as a biotechnological tool. In addition, some statistical resources will also be used and discussed. Antioxidants play an important metabolic role, preventing oxidative stress-mediated cell and tissue injury. Knowing the antioxidant content of nutritional components can help make informed decisions about diet design, and increase the commercial value of antioxidant-rich natural products. As a reliable and convenient technique to evaluate the whole spectrum of antioxidants present in biological samples is lacking, the general consensus is to use more than one technique. We have chosen two widely used and inexpensive methods, Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity and the ferric reducing antioxidant power assays, to evaluate the antioxidant content of several fruits, and to compare and analyze the correlation between both assays.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze first-year UFRJ medical students' perceptions about the implementation of a blended learning (BL) experience in their Biochemistry I course. During the first semester of 2009, three Biochemistry professors used the Constructore course management system to develop virtual learning environments (VLEs) for complementing course Modules I, II, and IV, using different resources and activities. Forty-nine students (46%) took part in the study. Results show that, in general, students gave positive evaluations to their experiences with BL, indicating that the VLEs have not only motivated but also facilitated learning. Most of the students reported that access to resources in the three modules provided a more in-depth approach to Biochemistry education and greater study autonomy. Students suggested that the VLEs could be better used for promoting greater communication among participants.

AB Inquiry-based instruction in the sciences has been demonstrated as a successful educational strategy to use for both high school and college science classrooms. As participants in the NSF Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) Program, we were tasked with creating novel inquiry-based activities for high school classrooms. As a way to introduce microbiology, molecular biology, ecology, and human health to students, we created a laboratory activity involving formation of biofilms composed of environmental bacteria from pond water and investigation into the resistance of these biofilms to antimicrobial agents. Two high schools participated in this study in different ways. Pike High School biology and advanced environmental science classrooms obtained pond water samples and grew biofilms from the bacteria in the pond water on plastic plates. They also observed killing of these biofilms by common household antimicrobial agents. As a senior capstone project, students at Arsenal Technical High School built on these research findings by isolating two different bacterial strains from the pond water and demonstrating the stimulatory effect of ethanol on biofilms formed by isolated bacterial strains. These activities were successful at introducing complex biological topics to high school students in a unique and exciting way. The students scored significantly higher on postactivity surveys compared with preactivity surveys that measured microbiology knowledge and experimental design knowledge. Furthermore, these projects seemed to elicit an excitement for science in the students who participated.

AB Exopolysaccharide (EPS) production by the rhizobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti is essential for root nodule formation on its legume host (alfalfa), and for establishment of a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between the two partners. Production of EPS II (galactoglucan) by certain S. meliloti strains results in a mucoid colony phenotype. Other strains that are unable to produce EPS II display a dry phenotype, due to the presence of an insertion element in the gene expR, a key regulator involved in many important cellular processes, including production of low-molecular-weight EPS II. We describe a series of three programmed undergraduate biochemistry laboratory classes teaching PCR and electrophoresis procedures to detect non-functional expR loci in S. meliloti.

AB The aim of the Structural Biology Extensible Visualization Scripting Language (SBEVSL) project is to allow users who are experts in one scripting language to use that language in a second molecular visualization environment without requiring the user to learn a new scripting language. ConSCRIPT, the first SBEVSL release, is a plug-in for PyMOL that accepts RasMol scripting commands either as premade scripts or as line-by-line entries from PyMOL's own command line. The plug-in is available for download at http://sourceforge. net/projects/sbevsl/files in the ConSCRIPT folder.

AB External representations (ERs), such as diagrams, animations, and dynamic models are vital tools for communicating and constructing knowledge in biochemistry. To build a meaningful understanding of structure, function, and process, it is essential that students become visually literate by mastering key cognitive skills that are essential for interpreting and visualizing ERs. In this article, first we describe a model of seven factors influencing students' ability to learn from ERs. Second, we use this model and relevant literature to identify eight cognitive skills central to visual literacy in biochemistry. Third, we present simple examples of tasks as a foundation for designing more sophisticated and complex items for assessing and developing students' visual literacy. We conclude that visual literacy is fundamental to the development of sound conceptual understanding and it is crucial to develop visual skills in parallel with meaningful learning outcomes in all biochemistry curricula.

AB This article describes an easy and cheap laboratory exercise for students to discover their own mitochondrial haplogroup. Students use buccal swabs to obtain mucosa cells as noninvasive tissue samples, extract DNA, and with a simple polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis they can obtain DNA fragments of different sizes that can be visualized in agarose gels. The analysis of these fragments can reveal the mitochondrial haplogroup of each student. The results of the exercise can be used to provide additional insights into the genetic variation of human populations.

AB Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential in analyzing large 'omics' datasets in biochemistry and molecular biology. Principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and uniform manifold approximation and projection are commonly used for data visualization. However, these methods can be challenging for students without a strong mathematical background. In this study, intuitive examples were created using COVID-19 data to help students understand the core concepts behind these techniques. In a 4-h practical session, we used these examples to demonstrate dimensionality reduction techniques to 15 postgraduate students from biomedical backgrounds. Using Python and Jupyter notebooks, our goal was to demystify these methods, typically treated as "black boxes", and empower students to generate and interpret their own results. To assess the impact of our approach, we conducted an anonymous survey. The majority of the students agreed that using computers enriched their learning experience (67%) and that Jupyter notebooks were a valuable part of the class (66%). Additionally, 60% of the students reported increased interest in Python, and 40% gained both interest and a better understanding of dimensionality reduction methods. Despite the short duration of the course, 40% of the students reported acquiring research skills necessary in the field. While further analysis of the learning impacts of this approach is needed, we believe that sharing the examples we generated can provide valuable resources for others to use in interactive teaching environments. These examples highlight advantages and limitations of the major dimensionality reduction methods used in modern bioinformatics analysis in an easy-to-understand way.

AB Many STEM disciplines are underrepresented to High School students. This is problematic as many students' decisions for college are shaped by their experiences and achievements in high school. Short content-oriented modules have been shown to encourage science identity and otherwise benefit the students' learning. Following the ASBMB's outreach protocol, we developed a short content-oriented module aimed at a high school biology classroom. Students interacted with 3D models of DNA and transcription factors while exploring structure-function relationships and introductory biochemistry topics. The high school teacher was impressed with the students' response to the module, specifically the ease with which students learned, their enthusiasm, and their recall of the experience. We provide all materials necessary to use this module, including student worksheet and printable model coordinates. We encourage both high school instructors and professional biochemists to consider similar module using physical models.

AB Large lecture courses are an efficient way to convey material to many students but have potential limitations, most notably the tendency for them to promote passive learning opportunities rather than active pedagogies. The curriculum at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, like many veterinary schools, contains many large lecture courses in the pre-clinical curriculum. This objective of this study was to use two active pedagogical interventions in a first-year lecture course named Veterinary Biochemistry and Metabolism that drew connections between basic science and several veterinary diseases. The first intervention targeted increasing students' intrinsic motivation and their confidence with understanding biochemistry concepts using videos created via collaborations between students, staff, and clinical and basic science faculty. The second intervention targeted active and collaborative learning via the implementation of clinical case studies completed in groups to relate lecture content to clinical scenarios with the aim of further enhancing student confidence in their knowledge of the material. To assess the effectiveness of these two interventions, pre-and post-course surveys using Likert style questions were administered to evaluate student confidence in the targeted concepts. The post-survey included open-ended responses on students' perspectives on their most important takeaways from the activities and their suggestions for improvements. The data showed a positive impact of these interventions on student motivation and confidence in their knowledge. This study provides support that targeted interventions to increase active learning strategies increase student engagement and may improve learning efficacy in large lecture courses.

We developed a semester-long activity for a molecular biology research methodology course where students created, and shared original memes related to course content with peers through group chat. Surveys and semi-structured interviews revealed that the exercise was effective in promoting student engagement, a sense of community, and relieving stress.

AB While biomedical and life science research have embraced interdisciplinarity as the means to solving pressing 21st century complex challenges, interdisciplinarity in undergraduate education has been more difficult to implement. As a consequence, disciplinary rather than interdisciplinary capstones have become ubiquitous. Disciplinary capstones are valuable for students because they enable them to integrate knowledge and skills within the discipline, but they are also limiting because the integration is within rather than across disciplines. In contrast to a capstone, which involves a single discipline, interdisciplinary capstones require two or more disciplines to combine and integrate across disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinarity, where two of more disciplines come together, is difficult to implement in the biomedical and life science curricula because student majors and finances are administered in ways, which reinforce institutional organization of schools and faculties and prevent collaboration. Here in this "idea to explore" we provide an interdisciplinary capstone model where students enroll in disciplinary courses, but then these disciplinary courses and students collaborate on interdisciplinary real-world problems. This interdisciplinary capstone model was implemented across two diverse and large biomedical and life science schools within two faculties in a research intensive, metropolitan university. This approach allows for integration of the biomedical, social and ethical perspectives required when solving problems in the real world, such as COVID-19. Interdisciplinary learning also better prepares students for higher degree research and future careers. Overcoming disciplinary curriculum silos and faculty barriers is critical if we are to meet expectations of acquiring interdisciplinarity as a key competency.

AB Facing recent threats of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an educational strategy was designed and applied to middle school students in order to reinforce related knowledge and behaviors. A group of 65 middle school students (14-18 years old) developed several designed online curricular activities. After the intervention, students answered a questionnaire to assess if they: (a) were familiar with the terms COVID 19 and SARS-CoV-2; (b) were conscious about the importance of preventive measures to stop the spread of this disease; (c) were engaged in these activities; (d) were motivated to research on health-related issues. This study was a first to attempt to evaluate student's perceptions about SARS-CoV-2 infection and support education regarding COVID-19, mainly on the reinforcement of preventive measures.

ID PEDAGOGIES
AB Project-based (research-driven) laboratory courses stimulate student involvement, improve critical thinking and initiate cooperative learning. To this end, a 7-week laboratory project was designed for a sophomore cell biology course to reinforce the fundamental relationship between genotype and phenotype using yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADH1). Working in pairs, students used site-directed mutagenesis to create a H44R mutation in the ADH1 gene sequence inserted into a YEp13 shuttle vector. These plasmids were propagated in E. coli, sequenced, and reintroduced into a yeast strain expressing no ADH1 activity. The growth patterns on selective media were determined. As the mutation allows for growth in the presence of allyl alcohol, students make the connection between DNA sequence and protein function. Student performance was assessed with pre- and post-tests, with improvement observed across all learning objectives. In addition to meeting the learning outcomes, 98% of the students thought that this experience allowed them to see how the scientific process can encompass multiple techniques to answer a single question. Eighty-four percent of the students thought that this experience was more engaging than other lab experiences they have had. Our multi-week laboratory examining the phenotypic changes in yeast alcohol metabolism successfully developed students' understanding of the scientific process, knowledge of molecular techniques and the relationship of gene sequence to protein function in an engaging manner.

AB Biochemistry curricula present a particular challenge to undergraduate students with abstract concepts which can lead to misconceptions that impede learning. In particular, these students have difficulty understanding enzyme structure and function concepts. Targeted learning activities and three-dimensional (3D) physical models are proposed to help students challenge these misconceptions and increase conceptual understanding. Here we assessed such pedagogical tools using the Enzyme-Substrate Interactions Concept Inventory (ESICI) to measure (mis)conceptual changes from Pre- to Post- time points in a single semester undergraduate biochemistry course. A Control group of students engaged with the active learning activities without the 3D physical models and students in the Intervention group utilized these activities with the 3D physical models. At the Post- time point both groups had higher, yet similar ESICI scores of the same magnitude as the highest scoring group from the national sample. Concomitantly, many misconception markers decreased compared to the national sample, although some of these differed between the Control and Intervention groups. Based on this assessment, both pedagogical approaches successfully increased conceptual understanding and targeted many of the misconceptions measured by the ESICI, however, several misconceptions persisted. Surprisingly, the students who used the 3D physical models did not demonstrate a further decrease in the misconception markers. Additionally, psychometric evaluation of the ESICI with our sample recommends the revision of several questions to improve the validity of this assessment. We also offer suggestions to improve instruction and pedagogical tools with further avenues for research on learning.

AB Optimal integration of education and ongoing faculty research in many undergraduate science programs is limited to the capstone project. Here, we aimed to develop a novel course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in synergy with ongoing faculty research. This 10-week course called Biomedical Research Lab is embedded in the curriculum of the undergraduate program Biomedical Sciences and grounded in the theoretical framework of research-based learning. Four groups of four students work together in a dedicated laboratory on an actual ongoing research problem of faculty. All groups work on the same research problem, albeit from different (methodological) perspectives, thereby stimulating interdependence between all participants. Students propose new research, execute the experiments, and collectively report in a single research article. According to students, the course enhanced scientific, laboratory, and academic skills. Students appreciated ownership and responsibilities of the research, laboratory teachers as role models, and they were inspired and motivated by doing authentic actual research. The course resulted in a better understanding of what doing research entails. Faculty valued the didactical experience, research output and scouting opportunities. Since topics can change per course edition, we have showcased a widely applicable pedagogy creating synergy between ongoing research and undergraduate education.

AB Metabolomics is one of the newest areas in biochemistry dedicated to investigating small biomolecules in biofluids, tissues, and cells. Cutting edge instruments used in metabolomics studies make it possible to identify thousands of biomolecules and determine their interactions with biological networks. This tremendous area has increased the significance of accurate chemical nomenclature of compounds. Therefore, the classification of the organic molecules has become one of the most important issues in the field. Biogenic amines are nitrogenous compounds of low molecular weight formed by the decarboxylation of amino acids or by the amination and the transamination of aldehydes and ketones during normal metabolic processes. This letter covers the topic of nomenclature with respect to the current usage of biogenic amines in scientific literature. We use metabolomics as an example of field reporting data on trace levels of molecules that may be miscategorized in primary literature. We suggest that the incorrect classification of molecules will influence science education adversely because resources used for teaching are drawn from primary literature references that may contain errors.

DE academic outcomes; accessing lecture recordings; biochemistry students
AB Many factors predict academic performance at university but accessing lecture recordings has not been established as one. Our aims were to quantify how and why biochemistry students accessed lecture recordings and to determine any association between accessing lecture recordings and academic outcomes. Lecture recording access data was collected and related to academic outcomes. On average, students accessed 46% of lecture recordings and each recording was accessed 2.3 times, but not to completion. After lecture delivery, students were slow to access lecture recordings, and the number of accesses was still increasing prior to the examinations. For the entire cohort, there were weak positive associations between accessing lecture recordings and academic outcomes for the semester, and between the access to lecture recordings in weeks 1-5 and 6-11 with the mid-semester and final examination, respectively. For programs, the weak association for the semester was only apparent for the pharmacy and biomedical science students, and not for the medical laboratory or nutrition students. The most common reason for accessing lecture recording was to "Revise lecture concepts for assessment purposes." For students, who did not attend lectures, lecture recordings were accessed predominantly as "I prefer the flexibility of online recordings." Flexibility was also the theme of the positive additional feedback on accessing lecture recordings. In conclusion, consideration needs to be given on how to persuade students to access lecture recordings in a timelier way. As accessing lecture recordings is weakly associated with positive academic outcomes for some program cohorts, this supports their continued availability.

AB The goal of this laboratory exercise is to give upper-level undergraduate students an introduction to sterile technique in mammalian cell culture and metabolism. The experiment can be completed within a 3-h lab period and can be performed either in conjunction with other biochemistry/metabolism experiments or used as a stand-alone experiment. In this experiment, students are tasked with relating the acidification of cell culture medium to metabolism in order to elucidate the mechanism of action for a compound. Students can relate their experimental results to topics covered on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in upper-level biochemistry classes as well as gain valuable experience relating metabolism to drug discovery.

AB The present pandemic has hurled organizations into a new social "norm"-and academia is not exempt. As a result, a novel pedagogy has evolved, demanding mechanisms of social distance teaching and learning be developed. This new era in education has learning institutions acquiring, adapting or even designing online STEM labs for physical science courses-replacing face-to-face teaching laboratory settings. The difficulty of designing science practicum that promotes student engagement and relates scientific principles to "real life" has heightened as we shift to more online instruction. Therefore, a necessity to develop contemporary methods of promoting student engagement and participation in an online learning environment has become apparent. Here, a virtual lab course designed for health science majors, utilized an online lab module and, with the use of a learning management system, adapted it to illustrate the principles of specific heat capacity in "real life": hot coffee. Students enrolled in the lab course were able to perform a virtual lab, complete calculations, compare calculated and experimental values, and relate the experimental chemistry topics to healthcare in a lab report. Following the lab experience, students completed an anonymous and voluntary qualitative survey in which they recommended this lab exercise for future classes.

AB Laboratory pedagogy is moving away from step-by-step instructions and toward inquiry-based learning, but only now developing methods for integrating inquiry-based writing (IBW) practices into the laboratory course. Based on an earlier proposal (Science 2011;332:919), we designed and implemented an IBW sequence in a university bioinformatics course. We automatically generated unique, double-blinded, biologically plausible DNA sequences for each student. After guided instruction, students investigated sequences independently and responded through IBW writing assignments. IBW assignments were structured as condensed versions of a scientific research article, and because the sequences were double blinded, they were also assessed as authentic science and evaluated on clarity and persuasiveness. We piloted the approach in a seven-day workshop (35 students) at Perdana University in Malaysia. We observed dramatically improved student engagement and indirect evidence of improved learning outcomes over a similar workshop without IBW. Based on student feedback, initial discomfort with the writing component abated in favor of an overall positive response and increasing comfort with the high demands of student writing. Similarly, encouraging results were found in a semester length undergraduate module at the National University of Singapore (155 students).

AB Structural biology education commonly employs molecular visualization software, such as PyMol, RasMol, and VMD, to allow students to appreciate structure-function relationships in biomolecules. In on-ground, classroom-based education, these programs are commonly used on University-owned devices with software preinstalled. Remote education typically involves the use of student-owned devices, which complicates the use of such software, owing to the fact that (a) student devices have differing configurations (e.g., Windows vs MacOS) and processing power, and (b) not all student devices are suitable for use with such software. Smartphones are near-ubiquitous devices, with smartphone ownership exceeding personal computer ownership, according to a recent survey. Here, we show the use of a smartphone-based augmented reality app, Augment, in a structural biology classroom exercise, which students installed independently without IT support. Post-lab attitudinal survey results indicate positive student experiences with this app. Based on our experiences, we suggest that smartphone-based molecular visualization software, such as that used in this exercise, is a powerful educational tool that is particularly well-suited for use in remote education.

In the United States, programs like the Summer Institutes (SI) have been used to help disseminate awareness and train faculty, precipitating efforts to understand EBT implementation barriers. Such studies have implied a distinction between awareness (the process in which instructors become cognizant of EBT) and enactment (the application of EBT practices in teaching) while generally focusing on the latter in contexts already endowed with high awareness or high support. As a result, very little is known about obstacles to EBT awareness in low-awareness, low-support contexts (LALSCs). The present study explores these through interviews and surveys of higher education STEM instructors in South Korea. Our interest was prompted by the failed attempt to implement a nationally accessible, grassroots EBT awareness program modeled off the SI. Several reasons for disinterest in EBT are revealed while faculty with and without research obligations were found to hold significantly different views about the utility of new teaching methods. Potential solutions for improving awareness are explored, revealing institutional supports and mandates through authority as the two options most likely to be effective. It is hoped this work may be used to inform the design of more effective EBT awareness programs, especially those in LALSCs.

AB Understanding macromolecular structures is essential for biology education. Augmented reality (AR) applications have shown promise in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, but are not widely used for protein visualization. While there are some tools for AR protein visualization, none of them are accessible to the layperson who possesses neither specialized AR hardware nor the technical skill to comfortably navigate three-dimensional (3D) rendering and file conversions. Here, we describe Palantir, an open source mobile Android application easily installable on compatible devices from the Google Play Store. Palantir does not require specialized hardware, printed image, manual 3D rendering, or file format conversion. Palantir makes AR macromolecular visualization accessible to anyone with a compatible mobile device, and we hope it finds widespread application in STEM education.

AB Although multiple efforts have been initiated to increase students' science proficiency scores, most of the schools in the United States do not reach the expected student academic performance. This study addresses the impact of a one-week summer scientific learning experience on students that worked with experimental procedures and students that did not. We describe and evaluate these two different interventions to explore what components influence high school students' perception of their scientific competence, performance, and recognition, using science identity as an analytical lens. Science identity score was increased at the end of both interventions. Interestingly, science identity change index was higher for the group that did not work with experimental procedures. Although this group did not perform any hands-on experiments, they report, through reflexive diaries and interviews that working with CRISPR-Cas9 models, being in a research laboratory, and seeing the instrumentation made them feel like scientists. Regarding science competence, both groups report exponential learning gains, although the group that performed the experiments reports more difficulties. Both groups report that mentorship was key in their competence and performance development. These findings suggest that our one-week scientific learning programs influence participants' perception of scientific competence and performance and create an opportunity to develop further studies on short scientific learning experiences using models and active learning activities.

ID MIMIVIRUS
AB Several educational trials on handling viruses and or virology have been reported. However, given their small size, direct visualization of these viruses under a microscope has been rarely performed. The so-called "giant viruses" are larger than other viruses with a particle size greater than 200-300 nm. This enables their direct visualization under a light microscope more easily than other viruses. In this study, we developed two new types of teaching material for learning about viruses and cellular organisms using mimivirus, one of the well-known giant viruses. One teaching material involves using glass slides with enclosed mimivirus particles, and another is a paper-based teaching material, named VIRAMOS (). Using these, students can investigate and learn about viruses and cellular organisms. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(4):426-431, 2019.

AB Allelopathy plays crucial roles in invasive plant viability and agricultural production systems. However, there is no well-established hands-on learning activity to teach the concept of allelopathy. Nor is there an activity which allows students to gain knowledge about glucosinolates and their corresponding enzyme, myrosinase, which are present in almost all Brassica crops. Lettuce germination was counted by the students from three different treatments including water treated with Parafilm sealing, horseradish treated with Parafilm sealing, and horseradish treated without Parafilm sealing. Additionally, lettuce root length was measured by students using ImageJ software from each treatment using pictures captured by students' smartphones. Students took an identical quiz as a pre-laboratory and a post-laboratory assignment. Their average scores on the pre-laboratory and post-laboratory quizzes were 3.14 and 6.56 out of 10, respectively, indicating the lab activity significantly improved students' understanding of allelopathy and glucosinolate-myrosinase system. In addition, students (n = 76) completed a survey post-laboratory to assess their self-efficacy. This simple and cost-effective laboratory activity improved students' knowledge and skill development as it made learning more inviting, meaningful, and fun.

AB A novel experiment has been developed with a goal of enhancing engagement and deepening understanding of fundamental molecular biology concepts. In this laboratory activity, students investigate the composition of pet foods through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. By conducting this experiment, students address a scientific question that has the potential to be of personal interest and they gain an appreciation of the power of genetic analysis. To develop this activity, ingredient lists of popular pet foods were surveyed and eight different components were selected to be the subject of inquiry. Reaction conditions for qPCR were validated and optimized, and a simple, efficient, and student-friendly protocol was developed. A cohort of upper-level biology students extracted DNA from pet foods and conducted the qPCR reactions. Specificity of amplification was determined by conducting melting point analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of the products. Student reactions were analyzed and efficacy of this approach for deepening understanding of fundamental biochemical and molecular biology concepts was documented.

AB In 1972 Christian B. Anfinsen received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for ...his work on ribonuclease, especially concerning the connection between the amino acid sequence and the biologically active conformation. The understanding of this principle is crucial for physical biochemistry students, since protein folding studies, bio-computing sciences and protein design approaches are founded on such a well-demonstrated connection. Herein, we describe a detailed and easy-to-follow experiment to reproduce the most relevant assays carried out at Anfinsen's laboratory in the 60s. This experiment provides students with a platform to interpret by themselves the structural and kinetic experiments conceived to understand the protein folding problem. In addition, this three-day experiment brings students a nice opportunity for protein manipulation as well as for the setting up of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques.

AB Understanding metabolism and metabolic pathways constitutes one of the central aims for students of biological sciences. Learning metabolic pathways should be focused on the understanding of general concepts and core principles. New technologies such Augmented Reality (AR) have shown potential to improve assimilation of biochemistry abstract concepts because students can manipulate 3D molecules in real time. Here we describe an application named Augmented Reality Metabolic Pathways (ARMET), which allowed students to visualize the 3D molecular structure of substrates and products, thus perceiving changes in each molecule. The structural modification of molecules shows students the flow and exchange of compounds and energy through metabolism.

AB Transformation of research in all biological fields necessitates the design, analysis and, interpretation of large data sets. Preparing students with the requisite skills in experimental design, statistical analysis, and interpretation, and mathematical reasoning will require both curricular reform and faculty who are willing and able to integrate mathematical and statistical concepts into their life science courses. A new Faculty Learning Community (FLC) was constituted each year for four years to assist in the transformation of the life sciences curriculum and faculty at a large, Midwestern research university. Participants were interviewed after participation and surveyed before and after participation to assess the impact of the FLC on their attitudes toward teaching, perceived pedagogical skills, and planned teaching practice. Overall, the FLC had a meaningful positive impact on participants' attitudes toward teaching, knowledge about teaching, and perceived pedagogical skills. Interestingly, confidence for viewing the classroom as a site for research about teaching declined. Implications for the creation and development of FLCs for science faculty are discussed.

AB Students frequently expressed difficulty in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in chromosomal recombination. Therefore, we explored alternative methods for presenting the two concepts of the double-strand break model: Holliday junction and heteroduplex formation, and Holliday junction resolution. In addition to a lecture and computer-animated video, we included a model building activity using pipe cleaners. Biotechnology undergraduates (n=108) used the model to simulate Holliday junction and heteroduplex formation, and Holliday junction resolution. Based on student perception, an average of 12.85 and 78.35% students claimed that they completely and partially understood the two concepts, respectively. A test conducted to ascertain their understanding about the two concepts showed that 66.1% of the students provided the correct response to the three multiple choice questions. A majority of the 108 students attributed the inclusion of model building to their better understanding of Holliday junction and heteroduplex formation, and Holliday junction resolution. This underlines the importance of incorporating model building, particularly in concepts that require spatial visualization.

AB The recent growth of biotechnology requires a wide range of expertise within the industry. Education is the primary platform for students to gain information and knowledge on biotechnology. In Malaysia where biotechnology is relatively new, education programs and courses must be tailored to meet the demands of the industry. A combination of theoretical knowledge as well as practical and industrial training is essential to ensure graduates are prepared for their career in the fields of biotechnology. Results from this study show that university students lack literacy on biotechnology information and access to facilities provided by the universities. This may be a significant contributing factor to the lack of knowledge and information amongst graduates. Furthermore comparative analysis on the biotechnology program in Malaysian universities with that of other countries show the need to restructure the program by offering more specialized courses as well as soft skills and business subjects. This is to meet the demands of the related professionals as well as the various branches that exist in the biotechnology industry.

AB Although there is increasing evidence for a relationship between courses that emphasize student engagement and achievement of student deep learning, there is a paucity of quantitative comparative studies in a biochemistry and molecular biology context. Here, we present a pedagogical study in two contrasting parallel biochemistry introductory courses to compare student surface and deep learning. Surface and deep learning were measured quantitatively by a study process questionnaire at the start and end of the semester, and qualitatively by questionnaires and interviews with students. In the traditional lecture/examination based course, there was a dramatic shift to surface learning approaches through the semester. In the course that emphasized student engagement and adopted multiple forms of assessment, a preference for deep learning was sustained with only a small reduction through the semester. Such evidence for the benefits of implementing student engagement and more diverse non-examination based assessment has important implications for the design, delivery, and renewal of introductory courses in biochemistry and molecular biology.

AB Studies indicate that the majority of students in undergraduate biochemistry take a surface approach to learning, associated with rote memorization of material, rather than a deep approach, which implies higher cognitive processing. This behavior relates to poorer outcomes, including impaired course performance and reduced knowledge retention. The use of case-based learning (CBL) into biochemistry teaching may facilitate deep learning by increasing student engagement and interest. Abundant literature on CBL exists but clear guidance on how to design and implement case studies is not readily available. This guide provides a representative review of CBL uses in science and describes the process of developing CBL modules to be used in biochemistry. Included is a framework to implement a directed CBL assisted with lectures in a content-driven biochemistry course regardless of class size. Moreover, this guide can facilitate adopting CBL to other courses. Consequently, the information presented herein will be of value to undergraduate science educators with an interest in active learning pedagogies.

AB Biochemistry is a visual discipline that requires students to develop an understanding of numerous representations. However, there is very little known about what students actually understand about the representations that are used to communicate ideas in biochemistry. This study investigated biochemistry students' understanding of multiple representations of enzyme-substrate interactions through both student interviews (N = 25) and responses by a national sample (N = 707) to the Enzyme-Substrate Interactions Concept Inventory. This manuscript reports the findings regarding one category of misconceptions measured by the concept inventory, namely, students' understandings of shape and charge in the context of enzyme-substrate interactions. Students interpret molecular representations depicting such interactions by determining the complementarity between enzyme and substrate by focusing upon charge and hydrogen bonding, but with a disregard for stereochemistry.

AB Intracellular and extracellular communication is conducted through an intricate and interwoven network of signal transduction pathways. The mechanisms for how cells speak with one another are of significant biological importance to both basic and industrial scientists from a number of different disciplines. We have therefore developed and implemented a new laboratory-intensive course that teaches students the theory and techniques used to study cell signaling pathways. Students learn these methodologies as they conduct a hypothesis-driven research project where they elucidate the mechanism of breast cancer cell death caused by a cancer chemotherapeutic agent. While each lab experiment can be conducted independently, the findings build upon one another to form the beginnings of a signaling pathway. In the lecture component of the course, students investigate different signaling pathways and the methods employed to study them. In addition, students actively participate in journal article discussions where they assess the primary scientific literature. We evaluated the course over two semesters and found that in both semesters learning outcomes were met by both undergraduate and graduate students. The evaluation of the course was based on a number of instructor assessments of student work, including lab reports, experimental results, journal article discussions, and a final cumulative exam. Furthermore, students' self-assessments revealed gains in perceived confidence in both conceptual knowledge and technical skills (c) 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 41(6):419-432, 2013

AB Enzyme function is central to student understanding of multiple topics within the biochemistry curriculum. In particular, students must understand how enzymes and substrates interact with one another. This manuscript describes the development of a 15-item EnzymeSubstrate Interactions Concept Inventory (ESICI) that measures student understanding of enzymesubstrate interactions. The validity and reliability of ESICI data were established through multiple methods. Results from the administration of the ESICI to biochemistry students across the United States (N = 707) are discussed in terms of instrument quality. The manuscript concludes with suggestions for how to use the ESICI for both teaching and biochemistry education research.

AB The study of protein-protein interactions is important to scientists in a wide range of disciplines. We present here the assessment of a lab-intensive course that teaches students techniques used to identify and further study protein-protein interactions. One of the unique elements of the course is that students perform a yeast two-hybrid screen and identify novel protein-protein interactions in what is essentially the beginning of an independent research project in the context of a class. While students benefit from the research-like experience, data is actively generated that can be further studied in independent research projects. Student learning outcomes were assessed using a questionnaire that was given to students before and after the course. The results indicate that students' conceptual and technical understanding of the methodologies taught in the class increased, and that hands-on experience in the lab was perceived to be the most important component of the course.

Although the case is fictitious, it is based on factual gene regulatory characteristics of oil-degrading microbes. The case is written for a sophomore Cell Biology lecture course at Indiana Wesleyan University that is taught to Biology/Pre-Med majors. This study is also appropriate for use in undergraduate microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and molecular genetics courses. The case is intended to enhance coverage of transcription, translation, control of gene expression, and selected molecular biology techniques. Opportunities to practice critical thinking skills and to a lesser extent an introduction to the paradigm of life science research at the industry level are provided.

AB Here, we present a six-session laboratory exercise designed to introduce students to standard biochemical techniques in the context of investigating a high impact research topic, acquired resistance to the cancer drug Gleevec. Students express a Gleevec-resistant mutant of the Abelson tyrosine kinase domain, the active domain of an oncogenic protein implicated in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and investigate the kinase activity of wild type and mutant enzyme in the presence of two cancer drugs. Techniques covered include protein expression, purification, and gel analysis, kinase activity assays, and protein structure viewing. The exercises provide students with a hands-on understanding of the impact of biochemistry on human health, and demonstrate their potential as the next generation of investigators.

AB Personalized medicine refers to medical care that involves genetically screening patients for their likelihood to develop various disorders. Commercial genome screening only involves identifying a consumer's genotype for a few single nucleotide polymorphisms. A phenotype (such as an illness) is greatly influenced by three factors: genes, gene expression levels, and the environment. The information supplied by personal genomics companies only involves genes and as such is not always indicative of a particular phenotype. Here, we propose a method for developing modular undergraduate laboratories that examine each contributing factor for a single gene. Although each module is suitable as an individual laboratory exercise, every module may be used in the same class to examine a single phenotype of interest, give students a more complete understanding of how a phenotype is produced and allow students to understand the science behind personalized medicine.

AB Despite being a traditional coursework for pre-medical and medical students around the globe, biochemistry education suffers from a lack of positive appreciation due to the nature of the subject combined with deficiency of teaching modalities. A first semester biochemistry course was designed to include four different teaching modalities: lectures, recitations, case studies, and student presentations. A multi-item, anonymous, and voluntary questionnaire was distributed to students who had just completed the course and to those who had taken it the previous year. The questionnaire asked students to evaluate the course and how the different modalities affected their learning. These questionnaires took place in a two-year period between 2020 and 2021. Eighty-six (46%) of 186 total students responded. The vast majority of respondents agreed with the use of multimodal teaching techniques with respect to its impact on overall preparedness for future coursework, understanding, and enjoyability. Lectures and recitations were found to be the most useful in information retention and learning, although the same were found to be less enjoyable than other modalities. Although case studies and presentations were found to be enjoyable, most students ranked them low in terms of information retention and were the most voted to be removed from the course. There was general agreement between premedical and medical students' perception on the usefulness of the multimodal teaching techniques with respect to medical biochemistry modules and standardized exams. The agreement between cohorts suggests the premedical students accurately evaluated the usefulness of the course for the following year and validates the usefulness of the premedical student surveys. Use of multiple modalities in biochemistry education can be of substantial benefit in engaging and preparing students for further education.

AB The modeling of rates of biochemical reactions-fluxes-in metabolic networks is widely used for both basic biological research and biotechnological applications. A number of different modeling methods have been developed to estimate and predict fluxes, including kinetic and constraint-based (Metabolic Flux Analysis and flux balance analysis) approaches. Although different resources exist for teaching these methods individually, to-date no resources have been developed to teach these approaches in an integrative way that equips learners with an understanding of each modeling paradigm, how they relate to one another, and the information that can be gleaned from each. We have developed a series of modeling simulations in Python to teach kinetic modeling, metabolic control analysis, 13C-metabolic flux analysis, and flux balance analysis. These simulations are presented in a series of interactive notebooks with guided lesson plans and associated lecture notes. Learners assimilate key principles using models of simple metabolic networks by running simulations, generating and using data, and making and validating predictions about the effects of modifying model parameters. We used these simulations as the hands-on computer laboratory component of a four-day metabolic modeling workshop and participant survey results showed improvements in learners' self-assessed competence and confidence in understanding and applying metabolic modeling techniques after having attended the workshop. The resources provided can be incorporated in their entirety or individually into courses and workshops on bioengineering and metabolic modeling at the undergraduate, graduate, or postgraduate level.

AB Lipidomics is a discipline that focuses on the identification and quantification of lipids. Although a part of the larger omics field, lipidomics requires specific approaches for the analysis and biological interpretation of datasets. This article presents a series of activities for introducing undergraduate microbiology students to lipidomic analysis through tools from the web-based platform MetaboAnalyst. The students perform a complete lipidomic workflow, which includes experiment design, data processing, data normalization, and statistical analysis of molecular phospholipid species obtained from barley roots exposed to Fusarium macroconidia. The input data are provided by the teacher, but students also learn about the methods through which they were originally obtained (untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry). The ultimate aim is for students to understand the biological significance of phosphatidylcholine acyl editing. The chosen methodology allows users who are not proficient in statistics to make a comprehensive analysis of quantitative lipidomic datasets. We strongly believe that virtual activities based on the analysis of such datasets should be incorporated more often into undergraduate courses, in order to improve students' data-handling skills for omics sciences.

AB Experiential learning is compromised in meeting the educational demands of our students during the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. A more inclusive, flexible, and objective-oriented experiential learning environment is required. In this context, module-based experiential learning that is executable on a digital platform was designed. The learning module focused on protein biochemistry, contained a combination of asynchronous and synchronous activities categorized into 'Knowledge Hub' and 'Lab-based Movie', across 5 weeks. Digital and module-based experiential learning provides equitable, inclusive, and flexible access to students at remote locations. Furthermore, it is an objective-oriented and highly organized experiential learning framework that encourages students to engage and participate more in the learning process.

AB Protein structure-function relationship serves as the primary learning outcome in any undergraduate biochemistry course. We expanded the protein structure-function exploration, PSFE initiative during COVID-19 to provide more effective and engaging experience to our undergraduates in biochemistry and independent research courses. Multiple alignments of protein sequences provided crucial insight into sequence conservation across many species and thus allow identification of those sections of the sequence most critical to protein function. We used Anabaena Sensory Rhodopsin, ASR its transducer, ASRT and downstream novel kinase gene products of Anabaena PCC 7120 to seek their alignment with homologs in available database. Pymol served an opportunity to achieve this goal (interactive learning during lab session and stimulation of course content discussion) in interesting ways. The PSFE initiative expansion continued during pandemic using online/hybrid modality. Initially model examples all helical ASR and beta-sheet ASRT were introduced to connect and integrate our ongoing research interest into classroom activities. Subsequently, undergraduates in biochemistry course were assigned a homolog of model proteins any particular protein of students choice to study and characterize using Pymol in semester. During first phase, each undergraduate worked independently using established guidelines. Student's exploration progress was periodically reviewed in pilot phase with majority of students who perceived it as challenging task successfully completed the assignment. Using the PyMol application to reinforce visual understanding of protein structure was highly satisfying experience that greatly enriched undergraduates understanding and appreciation. This article reports a session from the virtual international 2021 IUBMB/ASBMB workshop, "Teaching Science on BigData."

DE biochemistry; employability; post-graduate; skills; South Africa
AB Biochemistry encompasses a broad range of life science disciplines. Unlike more vocational disciplines such as pharmacy or medicine, the career path associated with biochemistry is less clearly defined. An important question is whether the skills set provided by post-graduate biochemistry education, defined as BSc (Hons.), MSc, or PhD degrees, is aligned with the requirements of a career in academia or industry. This article reports on former post-graduate biochemistry students and their careers and aims to establish whether former post-graduate students perceive a post-graduate qualification in biochemistry as useful for entry into the job market. This article is based on responses of 64 former post-graduate biochemistry students from South African universities who have graduated between 2010 and 2019. Findings show that most post-graduate biochemistry graduates continue a career in academia after graduating. Some pursue a career in the industry, while a very small number of biochemistry post-graduates are currently unemployed. These findings suggest that a post-graduate degree in biochemistry provides the necessary scientific and research skills sought after by the employment sector in South Africa.

AB The Beatles formed in Liverpool are one of the most famous music groups in the history of pop considered as the best-selling artists in the category "band," with the highest amount of claimed record sales. With their foremost pioneering activities in songwriting, artistic presentation, and recording, the band revolutionized many aspects of music industry and impacted social developments. Although active as a foursome in the 1960s, their music and films still attract new generations all over the world. Similar to former periods, the popularity of the Beatles and the fanaticism toward the band (i.e., "Beatlemania") has an ongoing impact on society and culture. Mostly unknown, Beatles songs inspire scientists in daily work and are part of clinical studies investigating aspects of human health and disease. This review briefly discusses the influence of The Beatles on Life Sciences, highlights the "better than the Beatles problem" affecting new drug development, and discusses several examples in which The Beatles impacted progression in Medicine. Finally, it is discussed if the meteoric success of the band contributed to the rapid progress in modern radiology.

AB Many biology students struggle to learn about the process of meiosis and have particular difficulty understanding the molecular basis of crossing over and the importance of homologous pairing for proper segregation. To help students overcome these challenges, we designed an activity that uses a newly developed Chromosome Connections Kit (R) from 3-D Molecular Designs to allow learners to explore meiosis at the molecular level. We took a backwards design approach in constructing an effective classroom activity. We developed evidence-based learning objectives and designed a crossing over activity that targets students' misconceptions and key concepts about meiosis. Assessment questions were designed based on the learning objectives and common student misconceptions. The activity consists of three parts: an interactive introductory video, a model-based activity, and reflection questions. The activity was first beta-tested with a small number of students and revised based on feedback. The revised activity was deployed in a mid-level Cell and Molecular Biology course. Analysis of pre-/post-assessment data from students who completed the activity (n = 83) showed strong learning gains on concepts related to ploidy, homology, segregation, and the mechanism and purpose of crossing over. Additionally, students who participated in the activity outperformed nonparticipants on a Genetics assessment about meiosis the following semester.

AB This study presents an evaluation of integrating virtual laboratory simulations in assessment design of a biotechnology course at Taylor's University in Malaysia before, during and post-COVID recovery phases. The purpose was to investigate how virtual laboratory simulations were integrated as part of the assessments of a practical-embedded course-the aim being to evaluate students' acceptance and perception of using virtual simulation. A total of 46 students, across three different study cohorts (August 2019, March 2020, and August 2020) were evaluated different educational aspects of using virtual laboratory cases in a 4-week course within Animal Biotechnology. Overall, students regarded virtual laboratory simulation useful as part of their learning, and there is a significant increase in the level of acceptance before, during and post-COVID recovery phases. The study showed that across the different study cohorts, students perceived their confidence level in laboratory skills have been enhanced and that they can apply the skills in real-life situation. Interestingly, students (March and August 2020 cohort) who have not been exposed to the related laboratory session still perceived that the simulated activity provides clear explanation and realistic experience. Furthermore, it had been highlighted across the study cohorts that the quiz questions helped to enhance their understanding on the underlying principles of the laboratory techniques. The overall conclusion of this study was that structured simulation-based activities which provide clear instructions and explanation would support significant improvements in students learning.

AB Jupyter notebooks are widely used for data analysis across a large number of scientific disciplines. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a series of computational exercises using the Jupyter notebook to replace the laboratory exercises usually undertaken in my course. My students had no prior coding knowledge and therefore these exercises were structured in a "cookbook" format using the susceptible-infected-resistant model for disease, data from the Lenski long-term evolutionary experiment, and a fission yeast transcriptomic data set. Despite limited internet connectivity and on-line instruction, my students completed these computational exercises and then tested their own hypotheses. Because Jupyter notebooks can be annotated with text and images, student notebooks were submitted for assessment in the form of a structured scientific report. An advantage of this approach was that all the computational analyses presented in these reports could be easily replicated. The notebook and complete instructions used in my course are provided for others who want to adopt this approach.

AB Introductory biochemistry courses are often challenging for students because they require the integration of chemistry, biology, physics, math, and physiology knowledge and frameworks to understand and apply a large body of knowledge. This can be complicated by students' persistent misconceptions of fundamental concepts and lack of fluency with the extensive visual and symbolic literacy used in biochemistry. Card sorting tasks and game-based activities have been used to reveal insights into how students are assimilating, organizing, and structuring disciplinary knowledge, and how they are progressing along a continuum from disciplinary novice to expert. In this study, game-based activities and card sorting tasks were used to promote and evaluate students' understanding of fundamental structure-function relationships in biochemistry. Our results suggest that while many markers of expertise increased for both the control and intervention groups over the course of the semester, students involved in the intervention activities tended to move further towards expert-like sorting. This indicates that intentional visual literacy game-based activities have the ability to build underdeveloped skills in undergraduate students.

AB Medical council of India has made remarkable modifications in the curriculum of medical students after a long period of more than 20 years with regulations on Graduate Medical Education 1997. Innovative and interactive teaching methods have taken center place in the implementation of the new curriculum nationwide. Small group teaching and problem-assisted learning have brought a paradigm shift in biochemistry teaching, which was earlier teacher cantered and was taught by only didactic lectures due to which biochemistry was considered a boring and dry subject. The present interventional study was conducted in the Department of Biochemistry, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi. All the students of MBBS first professional Batch 2018-2019 were enrolled in the present study. After sensitizing the faculty and students regarding jigsaw method of learning, it was undertaken in two different batches on 4 different days, with faculty and senior residents acting as facilitators. The groups were named according to rainbow colors. The topics were taught by power point presentation before the conduction of jigsaw activity that was discussed in form of seven clinical cases. Post jigsaw, a prevalidated feedback questionnaire was filled by the students. The faculty and senior residents gave a constructive feedback via focused group discussion. In our study 100% students opined that teaching and being taught by peers was beneficial in enhancing the in depth knowledge of the topic. Ninety-two percent students opined jigsaw learning helpful in promoting self-directed learning in the student, whereas 88.5% students felt that this teaching learning tool to be made a the regular part of the curriculum. Jigsaw groups create many opportunities for creative interchange of ideas and lively and meaningful participations. But due to limitation of time and logistics, it can be used in conjunction with routine methods of learning.

AB Mentoring to many is the informal highly unstructured teaching, advising, and nurturing which we receive from various individuals during our school years and professional lives and then give back to our students and more junior colleagues. However, with the advances in science and technology, the increasing competitiveness in the workplace, fast pace of life, and globalization, the importance of proper mentoring in the training of science professionals has gained the attention of and has been discussed and studied by higher institutions of learning and national academies of science. During the past two decades, efforts toward making mentoring more structured by national academies of sciences and academic and professional institutions have produced guidelines, mentoring programs for mentors and mentees, faculty, students, scholarly research publications on mentoring, and related aspects. This article attempts to discuss the various aspects and concerns of traditional, structured, and institutional mentoring.

AB In many of our courses, particularly laboratory courses, students are expected to engage in scientific writing. Despite various efforts by other courses and library resources, as instructors we are often faced with the frustration of student plagiarism and related writing problems. Here, we describe a simple Writing in Your Own Voice intervention designed to help students become more aware of different types of plagiarism and writing problems, avoid those problems, and practice writing in their own voice. In this article, we will introduce the types of plagiarism and writing problems commonly encountered in our molecular biology laboratory course, the intervention, and the results of our study. From the evaluation of 365 student reports, we found the intervention resulted in nearly 50% fewer instances of plagiarism and common writing problems. We also observed significantly fewer instances of severe plagiarism (e.g. several sentences copied from an external source). In addition, we find that the effects last for several weeks after the students complete the intervention assignment. This assignment is particularly easy to implement and can be a very useful tool for teaching students how to write in their own voices.

AB Rhizobacteria that colonize plant roots and promote plant growth are referred to as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, and this can stimulate plant growth either indirectly or directly. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by rhizobacteria have the capacity to promote plant growth as well as perform biocontrol of fungal pathogens. The microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) are characterized by a low molecular weight and a high vapor pressure, which facilitate evaporation and diffusion at normal temperatures and at above-ground and below-ground pressures. mVOCs can travel far from the point of production through the atmosphere, porous soils and liquids, thereby making them ideal infochemicals for mediating interspecific interactions. However, knowledge about the biological and ecological roles of microbial VOCs is still limited compared with that of plant VOCs. Here, we describe a simple and inexpensive laboratory class aimed at biotechnology or soil microbiology students, which uses techniques to increase their understanding of the mechanisms of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and also illustrate the effects of mVOCs emitted by rhizobacteria on plant growth promotion, as well as evaluating their potential as a biocontrol. The laboratory class is divided into two sessions: an initial 3-hour experimental session and a second 2-hour analytical one. The experimental session involves two separate experiments: one of which is dedicated to illustrating the effect of mVOCs on plant growth parameters, while the second explores the capacity of VOCs as a biocontrol. Also, the class provides students with an opportunity to perform useful assays, draw conclusions from their results, and discuss possible extensions of the study.

ID COLLEGE
AB In undergraduate biology laboratory courses, laboratory reports can be a useful tool for teaching scientific writing, integration of source material, and information literacy; however, these teaching objectives are at times undermined by students' plagiarism. Laboratory instructors often use similarity-matching software to detect plagiarism in laboratory reports, yet similarity hits detected with such software remain poorly characterized. In the upper division molecular biology laboratory course described here, Turnitin (R) routinely detected dozens of similarity hits in laboratory reports. To determine whether this abundance of similarity hits was indicative of widespread plagiarism, we analyzed similarity hits detected in 255 laboratory reports written by 135 students. Only a small minority of Turnitin (R) similarity matches were problematic, but over half of the laboratory reports contained at least one problem with incorporation of scientific sources (e.g., laboratory manual and scientific articles). We identified four common types of such writing problems: patchwriting, technical parroting, copying, and falsification of sources. In 18% of the laboratory reports, we detected an alarmingly superficial use of primary literature. Most of the source incorporation problems did not rise to the level of plagiarism. As a result of this study, we recommend changes in scientific writing instruction and a transition to laboratories providing more authentic research experiences.

AB Active-learning strategies such as undergraduate research courses and course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), which engage students in the practical experiments, have been reported as efficient ways for effective teaching and training of graduating students. Recently, many practical examples have been published in various fields to develop critical skills needed by undergraduate students for graduate school or the workforce; however, very few examples have been published for bioanalytical topics, specifically, Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Herein, we describe an innovative undergraduate research course that was used to train well-prepared graduating seniors on LC-MS-MS and in developing a sensitive method for detecting vitamin B9 (folic acid) levels in different milk samples. During this semester-long exercise, the students were exposed to literature review, basic UV-Vis spectroscopy, and HPLC and LC-MS-MS techniques. Additionally, as part of this laboratory-based research course, they researched published approaches on analyzing folic acid in food samples and devised a method to extract and quantify folic acid levels in different brands of milk using LC-MS-MS instruments. Feedback from students and faculty members was very positive as the students felt that this opportunity helped them to become more comfortable using HPLC and LC-MS-MS instruments and felt empowered to answer real-life analytical problems. This laboratory-based undergraduate research course can also be modified and used as an advanced bioanalytical laboratory exercise in biochemistry or analytical chemistry courses.

AB Due to resource limitations at predominantly undergraduate institutions, research opportunities for non-senior students can be limited. To provide opportunities for a variety of students to gain exposure to research, a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) was designed and conducted. Coupled inquiry was used to allow underclassmen and upperclassmen to participate. Students first utilized a bioinformatics approach to develop hypotheses concerning protein interactions with the receptor Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK). Students designed experiments to identify specific sites of interactions with SH2-domain proteins utilizing an assortment of basic biochemical techniques. The semester culminated in students testing their hypotheses and producing manuscripts. Underclassmen that participated in the course also benefitted from mentor-mentee relationships developed with upperclassmen due to the collaborative nature of the course. The structure of the course also allows for further studies to be conducted based on novel findings and is highly adaptable to receptor tyrosine kinases found in other tissue types.

ID INSERTION DELETION POLYMORPHISM
AB For medical students, we combine the laboratory practice with clinical applications by developing biochemical and molecular biology experiments. In this experiment, students first collect their own buccal epithelial cells by a noninvasive mouthwash method. Then, they extract genomic DNA and perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene using genomic DNA as a template. Finally, the polymorphism of ACE gene is observed by electrophoresis. Students not only learn the techniques but also acquire knowledge of the ACE gene polymorphism. By establishing the relationship among ACE polymorphism and high blood pressure and myocardial hypertrophy, students should be able to understand the gene polymorphism and its association with susceptibility to disease. This laboratory practice teaching can also stimulate desire to do scientific research. Experimental results from many individuals can help us determine and analyze the fractions of ACE gene types in Chinese cohorts. Such an experiment strongly activates students and provides a solid foundation for the medical students' future research and clinical application.

AB A laboratory exercise on the interaction between the herbicide pendimethalin (PM) and goat serum albumin (GSA), a carrier protein present in mammalian blood circulation, is described. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the binding reaction between PM and GSA. Titration of a constant amount of the protein (GSA) with increasing ligand (PM) concentrations produced a consecutive decrease in the protein's fluorescence. Treatment of the fluorescence quenching data according to the Stern-Volmer equation yielded the values of the Stern-Volmer constant (K-sv) and bimolecular quenching rate constant (k(q)), whereas values of the binding constant (K-a) and number of binding sites (n) were obtained from the double logarithmic plot. This experiment provides an exciting opportunity for undergraduate students to independently perform ligand binding studies with a protein, in addition to providing the means for the determination of their binding parameters.

AB Assessment is a central component of course curriculums and is used to certify student learning, but it can also be used as a tool to improve teaching and learning. Many laboratory courses are structured such that there is only a grade for a particular laboratory, which limits the insights that can be gained in student learning. We developed a laboratory program that incorporates assessments designed to probe student understanding of different components of the individual modules making up the program. The challenge was to analyze and present grades from these assessment tasks in a format that was readily interpretable by academics. We show that a simplified synthesis of grade distributions (grade distribution digests) provides sufficient information to make decisions about changes in course components. The main feature of the digests is its data visualization approach, where student grades for individual laboratory practicals, individual assessment tasks or individual assessment items are graphically presented as an overall average grade, an average top quartile grade and an average bottom quartile grade, and relative averages across all assessments. This ability to visualize student grades in variety of contexts enables academics with many other demands on their time (e.g. research and administration) to more efficiently identify ways to improve teaching delivery and learning outcomes. Examples are presented of the use of such data to identify and improve deficiencies in both student skills and teaching practice, resulting in improved learning outcomes.

AB Stem cells are cells that can self-renew and differentiate into a variety of cell types under certain conditions. Stem cells have great potential in regenerative medicine and cell therapy for the treatment of certain diseases. To deliver knowledge about this frontier in science and technology to medical undergraduate students, we designed an innovative practical experiment for freshmen in their second semester. The lab exercise focused on rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) isolation, cell culture and differentiation, and it aimed to help students master the aseptic techniques for cell culture, the basic methods and procedures for the primary culture and passage of BMSCs, the basic procedure for the directional differentiation of BMSCs into adipocytes and their subsequent identification by oil-red-O staining. This lab exercise is a very meaningful and useful introduction to stem cell collection and manipulation and inspires medical students to deepen their understanding of translational medicine and regenerative medicine.

AB The 8 studs on a 2 x 4 Lego brick conveniently represent the outer shell of electrons for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. We used Lego bricks to model these atoms, which are then joined together to form molecules by following the Lewis octet rule. A variety of small biological molecules can be modeled in this way, such as most amino acids, fatty acids, glucose, and various intermediate metabolites. Model building with these familiar toys can be a helpful, hands-on exercise for learning-or relearning-biochemical pathways. (C) 2017 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB With the increasing importance in the application of the molecular biological detection technology in the field of food safety, strengthening education in molecular biology experimental techniques is more necessary for the culture of the students in food quality and safety major. However, molecular biology experiments are not always in curricula of Food quality and safety Majors. This paper introduced a project competition of molecular biological detection technology for food safety among undergraduate sophomore students in food quality and safety major, students participating in this project needed to learn the fundamental molecular biology experimental techniques such as the principles of molecular biology experiments and genome extraction, PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis analysis, and then design the experiments in groups to identify the meat species in pork and beef products using molecular biological methods. The students should complete the experimental report after basic experiments, write essays and make a presentation after the end of the designed experiments. This project aims to provide another way for food quality and safety majors to improve their knowledge of molecular biology, especially experimental technology, and enhances them to understand the scientific research activities as well as give them a chance to learn how to write a professional thesis. In addition, in line with the principle of an open laboratory, the project is also open to students in other majors in East China University of Science and Technology, in order to enhance students in other majors to understand the fields of molecular biology and food safety.

AB The concepts of protein purification are often taught in undergraduate biology and biochemistry lectures and reinforced during laboratory exercises; however, very few reported activities allow students to directly gain experience using modern protein purification instruments, such as Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC). This laboratory exercise uses size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and ion exchange (IEX) chromatography to separate a mixture of four different proteins. Students use an SEC chromatogram and corresponding SDS-PAGE gel to understand how protein conformations change under different conditions (i.e. native and non-native). Students explore strategies to separate co-eluting proteins by IEX chromatography. Using either cation or anion exchange, one protein is bound to the column while the other is collected in the flow-through. In this exercise, undergraduate students gain hands-on experience with experimental design, buffer and sample preparation, and implementation of instrumentation that is commonly used by experienced researchers while learning and applying the fundamental concepts of protein structure, protein purification, and SDS-PAGE.

AB The presented research hypothesis-driven laboratory exercise teaches advanced undergraduate students state of the art methods and thinking in an integrated molecular physiology context. Students understand the theoretical background of iron acquisition in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. They design a flowchart summarizing the key steps of the experimental approach. Students are made familiar with current techniques such as qPCR. Following their experimental outline, students grow Arabidopsis seedlings up to the age of six days under sufficient and deficient iron supply. The Arabidopsis plants are of two different genotypes, namely wild type and fit loss of function mutants. fit mutants lack the essential transcription factor FIT, required for iron acquisition and plant growth. Students monitor growth phenotypes and root iron reductase activity in a quantitative and qualitative manner. Then, students determine gene expression regulation of FIT, FRO2, and a reference gene by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally, students interpet their results and build a model summarizing the connections between morphological, physiological and molecular iron deficiency responses. Learning outcomes and suggestions for integrating the course concept are explained. (C) 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB Computational molecular docking is a fast and effective in silico method for the analysis of binding between a protein receptor model and a ligand. The visualization and manipulation of protein to ligand binding in three-dimensional space represents a powerful tool in the biochemistry curriculum to enhance student learning. The DockoMatic tutorial described herein provides a framework by which instructors can guide students through a drug screening exercise. Using receptor models derived from readily available protein crystal structures, docking programs have the ability to predict ligand binding properties, such as preferential binding orientations and binding affinities. The use of computational studies can significantly enhance complimentary wet chemical experimentation by providing insight into the important molecular interactions within the system of interest, as well as guide the design of new candidate ligands based on observed binding motifs and energetics. In this laboratory tutorial, the graphical user interface, Docko-Matic, facilitates docking job submissions to the docking engine, AutoDock 4.2. The purpose of this exercise is to successfully dock a 17-amino acid peptide, a-conotoxin TxIA, to the acetylcholine binding protein from Aplysia californica-AChBP to determine the most stable binding configuration. Each student will then propose two specific amino acid substitutions of a-conotoxin TxIA to enhance peptide binding affinity, create the mutant in DockoMatic, and perform docking calculations to compare their results with the class. Students will also compare intermolecular forces, binding energy, and geometric orientation of their prepared analog to their initial a-conotoxin TxIA docking results.

AB When students build physical models from prefabricated components to learn about model systems, there is an implicit trade-off between the physical degrees of freedom in building the model and the intensity of instructor supervision needed. Models that are too flexible, permitting multiple possible constructions require greater supervision to ensure focused learning; models that are too constrained require less supervision, but can be constructed mechanically, with little to no conceptual engagement. We propose "model-dissection" as an alternative to "model-building," whereby instructors could make efficient use of supervisory resources, while simultaneously promoting focused learning. We report empirical results from a study conducted with biology under-graduate students, where we demonstrate that asking them to "dissect" out specific conceptual structures from an already built 3D physical model leads to a significant improvement in performance than asking them to build the 3D model from simpler components. Using questionnaires to measure understanding both before and after model-based interventions for two cohorts of students, we find that both the "builders" and the "dissectors" improve in the post-test, but it is the latter group who show statistically significant improvement. These results, in addition to the intrinsic time-efficiency of "model dissection," suggest that it could be a valuable pedagogical tool.

AB Gaining an understanding of how science works is central to an undergraduate education in biology and biochemistry. The reasoning required to design or interpret experiments that ask specific questions does not come naturally, and is an essential part of the science process skills that must be learned for an understanding of how scientists conduct research. Gaps in these reasoning skills make it difficult for students to become proficient in reading primary scientific literature. In this study, we assessed the ability of students in an upper-division biochemistry laboratory class to use the concepts of correlation, necessity, and sufficiency in interpreting experiments presented in a format and context that is similar to what they would encounter when reading a journal article. The students were assessed before and after completion of a laboratory module where necessary vs. sufficient reasoning was used to design and interpret experiments. The assessment identified two types of errors that were commonly committed by students when interpreting experimental data. When presented with an experiment that only establishes a correlation between a potential intermediate and a known effect, students frequently interpreted the intermediate as being sufficient (causative) for the effect. Also, when presented with an experiment that tests only necessity for an intermediate, they frequently made unsupported conclusions about sufficiency, and vice versa. Completion of the laboratory module and instruction in necessary vs. sufficient reasoning showed some promise for addressing these common errors.

AB The activity of mushroom tyrosinase can be measured by monitoring the conversion of phenolic compounds into quinone derivatives using spectrophotometry. This article describes a series of experiments which characterize the functional properties of tyrosinase, the analysis of the resulting data using R to determine the kinetic parameters, and the exploration of the structural properties of tyrosinase-inhibitor complexes. Tyrosinase assay development and subsequent activity measurements, in the presence of varying pH, substrate concentration and inhibitors, offers the opportunity to learn the enzyme characterization skills relevant to a research laboratory setting. Combining the activity studies with an exploration of the nature of the tyrosinase-inhibitor interactions enables a structural understanding of the experimental observations.

AB The College of the Holy Cross offers a universal first-year program called Montserrat, in which first-year students participate in a living-learning experience anchored by a yearlong seminar course. The seminar courses are part of a thematic cluster of four to eight courses; students in the cluster live together in a common dormitory and participate in shared co-curricular events designed to engage the entire cluster in intellectual discourse related to the theme. A two-semester seminar within the Natural World cluster was offered using biochemical principles as the underlying content. In the first semester, students were introduced to drug design, activity and abuse via student presentations and guided readings on ethnobotany, drug laws, drug use in religion, and prescription drug costs. In the second semester, students discussed primary readings in ethics followed by case study analyses of assisted reproduction technologies, informed consent, genetic privacy, performance enhancing drugs and genetically modified organisms. Student learning outcomes were evaluated via rubrics and a College-facilitated survey. (c) 2015 by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 43(4):263-272, 2015.

AB We have developed a metabolic pathways visualization skill test (MPVST) to gain greater insight into our students' abilities to comprehend the visual information presented in metabolic pathways diagrams. The test is able to discriminate students' visualization ability with respect to six specific visualization skills that we identified as key to the understanding of metabolic map diagrams. Application of the MPVST to B. S. Biochemistry students showed that their visualization skills develop informally and progressively during their college years. Furthermore, the complex nature of biochemical pathways, together with students' lack of familiarity with metabolic maps, suggests that it is important for instructors to spend more time than usual explaining visual representations to their students.

AB We present a lab that enables students to test the role of genes involved in the regulation of lateral roots growth in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, students design an experiment that follows the effects of the hormone auxin on the stimulation of genes involved in the formation of lateral root initials. These genes, known as lateral organ boundary domain containing protein (LBD) genes, are upregulated in the presence of auxin as part of a multistep molecular and biochemically controlled pathway. Depending on which LBD gene is tested, and the stage of root development, expression patterns are localized in a discrete and punctate fashion at the site of lateral root initials (LBD33), or reveal a broader localization pattern (LBD16). Students view expression using the reporter gene GUS (beta-glucuronidase). Before GUS staining, students view root growth in a "pseudo-aseptic" agar-based environment that allows complete visualization of whole root development to determine the proper stage to test molecular expression.

AB The increasing availability of concept inventories and other assessment tools in the molecular life sciences provides instructors with myriad avenues to probe student understanding. For example, although molecular visualization is central to the study of biochemistry, a growing body of evidence suggests that students have substantial limitations in their ability to recognize and interpret basic features of biological macromolecules. In this study, a pre/posttest administered to students at diverse institutions nationwide revealed a robust incorrect idea about the location of the amino acid side chains in the protein alpha-helix structure. Because this incorrect idea was present even after a semester of biochemistry instruction at a range of institutions, an intervention was necessary. A community of expert biochemistry instructors collaborated to design two active learning classroom activities that systematically examine alpha-helix structure and function. Several participating faculty used one or both of the activities in their classrooms and some improvement of student understanding of this concept was observed. This study provides a model of how a community of instructors can work together using assessment data to inform targeted changes in instruction with the goal of improving student understanding of fundamental concepts.

AB This report describes how a science communication module was incorporated into an advanced biochemistry course. Elements of communication were taught synergistically with biochemistry content in this course in an effort to expose students to a variety of effective oral communication strategies. Students were trained to use these established techniques and incorporated them into various presentations throughout the course. Three students describe their use of specific resources and how the skills learned relate to their future career. The importance and relevance of science communication are receiving unprecedented national attention. The academic scientific community must respond by incorporating more communication-centered instruction and opportunities in the classroom and laboratory.

AB It has become clear in current scientific pedagogy that the emersion of students in the scientific process in terms of designing, implementing, and analyzing experiments is imperative for their education; as such, it has been our goal to model this active learning process in the classroom and laboratory in the context of a genuine scientific question. Toward this objective, the National Science Foundation funded a collaborative research grant between a primarily undergraduate institution and a research-intensive institution to study the chemotactic responses of the bacterium Pseudomonas putida F1. As part of the project, a new Bioinformatics course was developed in which undergraduates annotate relevant regions of the P. putida F1 genome using Integrated Microbial Genomes Annotation Collaboration Toolkit, a bioinformatics interface specifically developed for undergraduate programs by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Based on annotations of putative chemotaxis genes in P. putida F1 and comparative genomics studies, undergraduate students from both institutions developed functional genomics research projects that evolved from the annotations. The purpose of this study is to describe the nature of the NSF grant, the development of the Bioinformatics lecture and wet laboratory course, and how undergraduate student involvement in the project that was initiated in the classroom has served as a springboard for independent undergraduate research projects.

AB Textbook illustrations of 3D biopolymers on printed paper, regardless of how detailed and colorful, suffer from its two-dimensionality. For beginners, computer screen display of skeletal models of biopolymers and their animation usually does not provide the at-a-glance 3D perception and details, which can be done by good hand-held models. Here, we report a study on how our students learned more from using our ordered DNA and protein models assembled from colored computer-printouts on transparency film sheets that have useful structural details. Our models (reported in BAMBED 2009), having certain distinguished features, helped our students to grasp various aspects of these biopolymers that they usually find difficult. Quantitative and qualitative learning data from this study are reported.

AB Higher education institutions and scientific funding agencies are emphasizing international projects that involve the integration and synergy between research groups, particularly if different disciplines are involved. Students with an education that reflects these trends will have more tools to succeed in the future, but it is challenging to provide this type of learning experience. Here we present the organization of a bi-national course with the goals to teach students protein structure/function relationships, which give them actual research experience in both computational and experimental laboratories, and engage them in an international networking experience. Two collaborative learning courses were organized at Loyola University Chicago (USA) and Universidad Nacional del Litoral (Argentina) for graduate and advanced undergraduate students. Multiple instructors at different stages in their careers gave lectures during the course and were able to interact with students on a one-on-one basis. Nearly every student from both institutions thoroughly enjoyed this approach, and they learned more about protein structure and gained important tools for their own research. We believe that this type of course design is applicable and transferable to other institutions and areas of science. We found that the combination of international networking and incorporation of actual research projects ignited the enthusiasm of students and instructors. Due to the success of these courses, we planned to incorporate them as regular series in our curriculum.

AB Graduate programs in medicine and biomedical sciences have been severely impacted by the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic over the last 2 years. Following 2 years since beginning of the pandemic, data on student support, educational and academic performance as well as sentiment on changes to educational programs are starting to emerge. We performed and compared results of two cross-sectional surveys of Swedish and U.S.-based medical and biomedical graduate students on how the pandemic has affected their studies, research productivity and career trajectory. Students were also asked to assess support provided by the university and supervisors. The surveys also captured student demographics and a range of other factors, such as pressures brought on by caretaking and financial responsibilities. We analyzed answers from 264 and 106 students attending graduate programs in universities in Sweden and the United States, respectively. U.S.-based students faced more severe restrictions on their research program compared to students in Sweden, reporting more delays in productivity, scientific output and graduation, and increased worries about their career trajectory. Swedish students had more caretaking responsibilities, although these did not cause any delays in graduation. While support by universities and supervisors was comparable between the countries, financial worries and mental health concerns were particularly prominent in the U.S. cohort. Student performance and outlook was hugely dependent on the breadth of the restrictions and the available support. Besides the governmental and university-led approach to counter the pandemic, societal differences also played a role in how well students were handling effects of the pandemic.

ID THINKING
AB Adult learning involves the analysis and synthesis of knowledge to become competent, which cannot be assessed only by traditional assessment tool and didactic learning methods. Stimulation of higher domains of cognitive learning needs to be inculcated to reach a better understanding of the subject rather than traditional assessment tools that relies primarily on rote learning. So, there is need for an alternative assessment tool. Hence, we conducted a study where we used case-based examination methodology. This study was conducted on 226 Ist year MBBS students in Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi (India). Based on their compiled internal assessment marks according to monthly formative assessment, students were categorized into 3 groups (I: 0-7; II: 8-14; III: 15-20) marks out of 20 marks respectively. Two sets of question papers were set by three examiners, on the same topics carrying 50 marks each. The first set was based on traditional assessment tool (Paper-A) with recall questions and second set on case-based assessment method (Paper-B). Out of 226 students, 146 were males and 80 were females. For all groups, marks (mean +/- SD) in Paper B were found to be higher (18.40 +/- 4.29, 30.01 +/- 4.12, and 40.33 +/- 1.15) as compared to paper A (10.88 +/- 4.34, 21.96 +/- 7.34, and 31.50 +/- 6.94) respectively. However, we found that there was significant (p < 0.001) difference in group I & II, whereas with group III, difference was found to be insignificant. Hence, we concluded that students performed better in case-based assessment rather than traditional method due to their direct involvement. Thus, for better memory and deeper learning the subjects can be assessed by case-based assessment method.

AB A challenge in the pandemic era is to implement effective but flexible practical teaching for biological sciences courses. Such teaching needs to deliver conceptual, analytical and practical skills training while having the option to rapidly respond to health and safety issues, local regulations, staff and student concerns. In this paper, we describe a set of cell biology practicals (mini-project) that meets many of these requirements and provides flexibility in providing skills training both through online and in practical laboratory environments. We have used a human adenocarcinoma cell line A431 stably transfected with a fluorescent cell cycle reporter as a biological model to deliver training through discrete work packages encompassing cell culture, fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry and statistics. How such work packages can be modified to, an online format either partially or completely is also described. Furthermore, the activities can be adapted for teaching both undergraduate and postgraduate level courses to ensure effective skills training which is applicable to a wide range of biological degree programs and levels of study.

AB As a representative catabolic reaction that widely exists in nature, anaerobic digestion (AD) exhibits great value regarding the global carbon cycle, renewable energy development, and environmental protection. Such an important biochemical reaction was ignored before and should be introduced into the teaching and textbooks of undergraduate biochemistry courses. However, students may face obstructions when learning AD theories since the metabolic pathways in AD are very complex. To solve these problems, an instructive metabolic minimap of the AD reaction was designed, including its reaction stages, reaction pathways, substrates, and enzymes. Furthermore, the interrelationships between aerobic catabolism (AEC) and anaerobic catabolism (ANC) were also summarized by combining the catabolic pathways of typical biological macromolecules. In this paper, AD theories were first replenished into undergraduate biochemistry courses by metabolic minimap, which not only provided valuable supports for the practical teaching of AD in undergraduate biochemistry courses, but also acted as an important reference for students in biology-related majors and biochemistry teachers.

AB Integrating the use of large datasets into our teaching provides critical and unique opportunities to build students' skills and conceptual knowledge. Here, we discuss the core components needed to develop effective activities based on large datasets, which align with the 5E learning cycle. Data-based activities should be structured around a relevant question, use authentic publicly accessible data, be scaffolded to include choice, and involve discussion of the results. It is important that the software that is used to manipulate, analyze and/or visualize the data is accessible for students. There are a range of strategies to reduce the barriers of working with large datasets through pre-organizing and pre-scripting code for analyses, using online cloud-based versions of software, and reducing opportunities for error in syntax. Resources exist for learning open-source software (e.g., Data Carpentry) as well as for support and professional development in teaching with large datasets (Project EDDIE).

AB CRISPR is a technique increasingly used in the laboratory for both fundamental and applied research. We designed and implemented a lab experience for undergraduates to carry out CRISPR technology in the lab, and knockout the wing patterning genes optix and WntA in Vanessa cardui butterflies. Students obtained spectacular phenotypic mutants of butterfly wings color and patterns, awakening curiosity about how genomes encode morphology. In addition, students successfully used molecular techniques to genotype and screen wild-type caterpillar larvae and butterflies for CRISPR edits in genes. Student feedback suggests that they experienced a meaningful process of scientific inquiry by carrying out the whole CRISPR workflow process, from the design and delivery of CRISPR components through microinjection of butterfly eggs, the rearing of live animals through their complete life cycle, and molecular and phenotypic analyses of the resulting mutants. We discuss our experience using CRISP genome editing experiments in butterflies to expose students to hands-on research experiences probing gene-to-phenotype relationships in a charismatic and live organism.

AB The final year of a biochemistry degree is usually a time to experience research. However, laboratory-based research projects were not possible during COVID-19. Instead, we used open datasets to provide computational research projects in metagenomics to biochemistry undergraduates (80 students with limited computing experience). We aimed to give the students a chance to explore any dataset, rather than use a small number of artificial datasets (similar to 60 published datasets were used). To achieve this, we utilized Google Colaboratory (Colab), a virtual computing environment. Colab was used as a framework to retrieve raw sequencing data (analyzed with QIIME2) and generate visualizations. Setting up the environment requires no prior experience; all students have the same drive structure and notebooks can be shared (for synchronous sessions). We also used the platform to combine multiple datasets, perform a meta-analysis, and allowed the students to analyze large datasets with 1000s of subjects and factors. Projects that required increased computational resources were integrated with Google Cloud Compute. In future, all research projects can include some aspects of reanalyzing public data, providing students with data science experience. Colab is also an excellent environment in which to develop data skills in multiple languages (e.g., Perl, Python, Julia).

AB The emergence of the global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has posed several challenges to education across the globe and led to the emergence and progression of newer methods of teaching and assessment. While online teaching has been quickly adopted and implemented across the globe, exams and assessment remain poorly managed both at an elementary and higher level. The practice of promoting students without an equivalent assessment or poor methods of online examinations systems poses a future difficulty in employability assessment and academic equivalence. Here we propose some suggestive measures especially for developing economies with a lack of adequate technology and insufficiently sensitized trainers for online assessment to avert the difficulties due to faulty examination schemes in pandemic situations with prolonged lockdowns.

AB Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many colleges shifted to online learning, creating a need for teaching materials that could be deployed in the online setting. A pair of virtual laboratory exercises with a COVID-19 theme were created for first year Biology majors to introduce students to the topics of polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis. The exercises were effective in promoting student learning of both topics in an online asynchronous setting, and could easily be adapted for use in other courses or in a synchronous online setting.

AB Objectively Structured Clinical/Practical Examination (OSCE/OSPE) has been the backbone of the assessment system of graduate medical education for over three decades. We have developed an electronic Objectively Structured Practical Examination (e-OSPE) in Medical Biochemistry using the freely available Google forms to mitigate the academic disruption posed by COVID-19 pandemic in our resource-poor setting. Ten e-OSPE stations created, interlinked, and time-restricted. Fifty undergraduate students appeared for the e-OSPE examination on a prefixed date and time. Learner feedback was collected immediately after the completion of the examination. Facilitator feedback was also collected. Students' mean scores in e-OSPE and traditional OSPE were 78.15% and 74.56%, respectively. Their difference was not statistically significant (paired t-test two-tailed p-value 0.0979). Thus, the results of e-OSPE are reliable as compared to traditional OSPE. Bland Altman Plot revealed 92% of students had scores that were in the agreeable limit of both traditional OSPE and e-OSPE. Both the learners and facilitators were in consensus that the online format of e-OSPE is a good alternative for assessment (0.67 and 0.82); their experience was good (0.72 and 0.92) and conduction was well organized (0.73 and 0.86). Several suggestions were also received to make e-OSPE even more effective. In conclusion, this pilot study showed e-OSPE can be an effective alternative to traditional OSPE when "in-person" evaluation is not possible such as in the current era of COVID-19 even in resource-limited settings.

AB A biochemistry class was transformed to implement student-centered, active-learning pedagogies to help improve competencies associated with the scientific method. In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course content switched from the biochemistry of nucleic acids to the science of the newly discovered virus, SARS-CoV-2. This provided a unique opportunity to model authentic science inquiry through cycles of questioning, investigating, assessing, and critical thinking on a rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary topic. This learning experience helped enhance science literacy, supported self-directed learning and curiosity, and emphasized the importance of evaluating information sources to recognize misinformation.

AB The Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) is a world-class research center devoted to understanding fundamental questions about human health and disease. In addition to conducting multidisciplinary research of excellence, IRB Barcelona is committed to maintaining an open dialogue with the public about its work, fostering scientific vocations and promoting scientific culture in society. In this regard, the institute has several public engagement and science education initiatives to reach these goals. In this article, we highlight two projects directed toward primary school and secondary school students, respectively: the Tandem Project and the Crazy About Biomedicine Programme. Although each of these activities has slightly different objectives and target audiences, they share the commitment of the institute to contribute to the science education of young students. We believe that it is the responsibility of research institutes to promote these kinds of initiatives, which have the potential to spark passion for science and thus foster scientific vocations. The new generation of scientists is in our hands.

ID PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION
AB In order to help promote instructional change at French-speaking universities in Europe, we initiated a series of 1-day events centered on learning innovations. Since 2015, these events have been taking place every 6 months at the Universite Paris Descartes, with the moral support of three learned scientific societies, the French Academy of Sciences, and sponsoring by leaders in textbook editing and classroom technologies. Each event gathers ~ 40 participants (faculty members, postdocs, and educational specialists) from four countries (Belgium, France, Luxemburg, Switzerland) and invitees, who share their active learning practices, flipped classroom variations representing the most popular strategy. Their experience revealed that faculty who invest themselves in revamping teaching are still isolated at their institutions, although institutional and national support have now been gaining momentum. In particular, the role of educational specialists (known as ingenieurs pedagogiques in France) is key to help faculty move away from lecturing. Overall, our event series illustrates that a hands-off approach is effective to foster a cross-border community of committed academics in a context where the process of changing the way we teach at universities is still in its infancy.

AB Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) can be a very effective means to introduce a large number of students to research. CUREs are often an extension of the instructor's research, which may make them difficult to replicate in other settings because of differences in expertise or facilities. The BASIL (Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Lab) CURE has evolved over the past 4 years as faculty members with different backgrounds, facilities, and campus cultures have all contributed to a robust curriculum focusing on enzyme function prediction that is suitable for implementation in a wide variety of academic settings.

AB Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is the most classical technique favored worldwide for resolution of macromolecules in many biochemistry laboratories due to its incessant advanced developments and wide modifications. These ever-growing advancements in the basic laboratory equipments lead to emergence of many expensive, complex, and tricky laboratory equipments. Practical courses of biochemistry at high school or undergraduate levels are often affected by these complications. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis technique (2D-PAGE) used for resolving thousands of proteins in a gel is a combination of isoelectric focusing (first dimension gel electrophoresis technique) and sodium-dodecylsulphate PAGE (second dimension gel electrophoresis technique or SDS-PAGE). Two different laboratory equipments are needed to carry out effective 2D-PAGE technique, which also invites extra burden to the school laboratory. Here, we describe a low cost, time saving and simple gel cassette for protein 2D-PAGE technique that uses easily fabricated components and routine off-the-shelf materials. The performance of the apparatus was verified in a practical exercise by a group of high school students with positive outcomes.

AB This article describes a simple exercise using a free, easy-to-use, established online program. The exercise helps to reinforce protein purification concepts and introduces undergraduates to pH as a parameter that affects anion-exchange chromatography. The exercise was tested with biochemistry majors at California State University-Chico. Given the versatility of the program, this work is also a model for instructors that wish to develop their own exercise to help teach other protein purification techniques.

AB This study investigates the role of representational competence in student responses to an assessment of hydrogen bonding. The assessment couples the use of a multiple-select item (Choose all that apply) with an open-ended item to allow for an examination of students' cognitive processes as they relate to the assignment of hydrogen bonding within a structural representation. Response patterns from the multiple-select item implicate heuristic usage as a contributing factor to students' incorrect responses. The use of heuristics is further supported by the students' corresponding responses to the open-ended assessment item. Taken together, these data suggest that poor representational competence may contribute to students' previously observed inability to correctly navigate the concept of hydrogen bonding.

AB This study questions the presumed relation between formal schooling and scientific literacy about biotechnologies. Comparing science and nonscience majors ' knowledge of and attitudes toward biotechnological applications, conclusions are drawn if their formal learnings improve pupils ' understandings of and attitudes toward biotechnology applications. Sample of the study consists of 403 undergraduate and graduate students, 198 nonscience, and 205 science majors. The Biotechnology Knowledge Questionnaire and the Biotechnology Attitude Questionnaire were administered. Descriptive statistics ( mean and percentages), t test, and correlations were used to examine the participants ' knowledge of biotechnology and attitudes toward biotechnological applications and differences as regards their majors. Although the science majors had higher knowledge and attitude scores than the nonscience majors, it is not possible to say that they have sufficient knowledge of biotechnologies. Besides, the participants ' attitudes toward biotechnological applications were not considerably related to their knowledge of biotechnology.

AB A pedagogic intervention, in the form of an inquiry-based peer-assisted learning project (as a practical student-led bioinformatics module), was assessed for its ability to increase students' engagement, practical bioinformatic skills and process-specific knowledge. Elements assessed were process-specific knowledge following module completion, qualitative student-based module evaluation and the novelty, scientific validity and quality of written student reports. Bioinformatics is often the starting point for laboratory-based research projects, therefore high importance was placed on allowing students to individually develop and apply processes and methods of scientific research. Students led a bioinformatic inquiry-based project (within a framework of inquiry), discovering, justifying and exploring individually discovered research targets. Detailed assessable reports were produced, displaying data generated and the resources used. Mimicking research settings, undergraduates were divided into small collaborative groups, with distinctive central themes. The module was evaluated by assessing the quality and originality of the students' targets through reports, reflecting students' use and understanding of concepts and tools required to generate their data. Furthermore, evaluation of the bioinformatic module was assessed semi-quantitatively using pre-and post-module quizzes (a non-assessable activity, not contributing to their grade), which incorporated process-and content-specific questions (indicative of their use of the online tools). Qualitative assessment of the teaching intervention was performed using post-module surveys, exploring student satisfaction and other module specific elements. Overall, a positive experience was found, as was a post module increase in correct process-specific answers. In conclusion, an inquiry-based peer-assisted learning module increased students' engagement, practical bioinformatic skills and process-specific knowledge.

AB The development and implementation of research-inspired, discovery-based experiences into science laboratory curricula is a proven strategy for increasing student engagement and ownership of experiments. In the novel laboratory module described herein, students learn to express, purify, and characterize a carbohydrate-active enzyme using modern techniques and instrumentation commonly found in a research laboratory. Unlike in a traditional cookbook-style experiment, students generate their own hypotheses regarding expression conditions and quantify the amount of protein isolated using their selected variables. Over the course of three 3-hour laboratory periods, students learn to use sterile technique to express a protein using recombinant DNA in E. coli, purify the resulting enzyme via affinity chromatography and dialysis, analyze the success of their purification scheme via SDS-PAGE, assess the activity of the enzyme via an HPLC-based assay, and quantify the amount of protein isolated via a Bradford assay. Following the completion of this experiment, students were asked to evaluate their experience via an optional survey. All students strongly agreed that this laboratory module was more interesting to them than traditional experiments because of its lack of a predetermined outcome and desired additional opportunities to participate in the experimental design process. This experiment serves as an example of how research-inspired, discovery-based experiences can benefit both the students and instructor; students learned important skills necessary for real-world biochemistry research and a more concrete understanding of the research process, while generating new knowledge to enhance the scholarly endeavors of the instructor.

AB SDS-PAGE and western blotting are two commonly taught protein detection techniques in biochemistry and molecular biology laboratory classrooms. A pitfall associated with incorporating these techniques into the laboratory is the significant wait times that do not allow students to obtain timely results. The waiting associated with SDS-PAGE comes from staining and destaining, whereas with western blotting it is the times required for antibody incubations and the numerous wash steps. This laboratory exercise incorporates 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) into the SDS-PAGE gel allowing for visualization of migrated proteins in a matter of minutes, saving both the time and chemical waste associated with traditional Coomassie staining. Additionally, TCE staining does not affect protein transfer eliminating the requirement for duplicated gels for total protein and western analyses. Protein transfer can be confirmed immediately without the use of Ponceau S staining. Lastly, this western blot procedure has been further shortened by using an HRP-conjugated primary antibody, which eliminates the secondary antibody incubation and washes, and uses a colorimetric detection to allow for visualization by students without the need for specialized equipment.

AB Modern research often requires collaboration of experts in fields, such as math, chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science to develop unique solutions to common problems. Traditional introductory undergraduate laboratory curricula in the sciences often do not emphasize connections possible between the various disciplines. We designed an interdisciplinary, medically relevant, project intended to help students see connections between chemistry and biology. Second term organic chemistry laboratory students designed and synthesized potential polymer inhibitors or inducers of polyglutamine protein aggregation. The use of novel target compounds added the uncertainty of scientific research to the project. Biology laboratory students then tested the novel potential pharmaceuticals in Huntington's disease model assays, using in vitro polyglutamine peptide aggregation and in vivo lethality studies in Drosophila. Students read articles from the primary literature describing the system from both chemical and biological perspectives. Assessment revealed that students emerged from both courses with a deeper understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of biology and chemistry and a heightened interest in basic research. The design of this collaborative project for introductory biology and organic chemistry labs demonstrated how the local interests and expertise at a university can be drawn from to create an effective way to integrate these introductory courses. Rather than simply presenting a series of experiments to be replicated, we hope that our efforts will inspire other scientists to think about how some aspect of authentic work can be brought into their own courses, and we also welcome additional collaborations to extend the scope of the scientific exploration.

AB This article advances the prerequisite network as a means to visualize the hidden structure in an academic curriculum. Networks have been used to represent a variety of complex systems ranging from social systems to biochemical pathways and protein interactions. Here, I treat the academic curriculum as a complex system with nodes representing courses and links between nodes the course prerequisites as readily obtained from a course catalogue. I show that the catalogue data can be rendered as a directed acyclic graph, which has certain desirable analytical features. Using metrics developed in mathematical graph theory, I characterize the overall structure of the undergraduate curriculum of Benedictine University along with that of its Biochemistry and Molecular Biology program. The latter program is shown to contain hidden community structure that crosses disciplinary boundaries. The overall curriculum is seen as partitioned into numerous isolated course groupings, the size of the groups varying considerably. Individual courses serve different roles in the organization, such as information sources, hubs, and bridges. The curriculum prerequisite network represents the intrinsic, hard-wired constraints on the flow of information in a curriculum, and is the organizational context within which learning occurs. I explore some applications for advising and curriculum reform. (c) 2015 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 43(3):168-180, 2015.

ID METABOLIC-ACIDOSIS
AB Only diazotrophic bacteria, called Rizhobia, living as symbionts in the root nodules of leguminous plants and certain free-living prokaryotic cells can fix atmospheric N-2. In these microorganisms, nitrogen fixation is carried out by the nitrogenase protein complex. However, the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia has an extremely high activation energy due to the stable (unreactive) NN triple bond. The structural and functional features of the nitrogenase protein complex, based on the stepwise transfer of eight electrons from reduced ferredoxin to the nitrogenase, coupled to the hydrolysis of 16 ATP molecules, to fix one N-2 molecule into two NH3 molecules, is well understood. Yet, a number of different nitrogenase-catalyzed reactions are present in biochemistry textbooks, which might cause misinterpretation. In this article, we show that when trying to balance the reaction catalyzed by the nitrogenase protein complex, it is important to show explicitly the 16 H+ released by the hydrolysis of the 16 ATP molecules needed to fix the atmospheric N-2 (c) 2015 by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 43(3):142-144, 2015.

AB The sequencing of whole genomes and the analysis of genetic information continues to fundamentally change biological and medical research. Unfortunately, the people best suited to interpret this data (biologically trained researchers) are commonly discouraged by their own perceived computational limitations. To address this, we developed a course to help alleviate this constraint. Remarkably, in addition to equipping our undergraduates with an informatic toolset, we found our course design helped prepare our students for collaborative research careers in unexpected ways. Instead of simply offering a traditional lecture- or laboratory-based course, we chose a guided inquiry method, where an instructor-selected research question is examined by students in a collaborative analysis with students contributing to experimental design, data collection, and manuscript reporting. While students learn the skills needed to conduct bioinformatic research throughout all sections of the course, importantly, students also gain experience in working as a team and develop important communication skills through working with their partner and the class as a whole, and by contributing to an original research article. Remarkably, in its first three semesters, this novel computational genetics course has generated 45 undergraduate authorships across three peer-reviewed articles. More importantly, the students that took this course acquired a positive research experience, newfound informatics technical proficiency, unprecedented familiarity with manuscript preparation, and an earned sense of achievement. Although this course deals with analyses of genetic systems, we suggest the basic concept of integrating actual research projects into a 16-week undergraduate course could be applied to numerous other research-active academic fields.

AB We present a novel laboratory project employing real-time RT-qPCR to measure the effect of environment on the expression of the FLOWERING LOCUS C gene, a key regulator of floral timing in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The project requires four 3-hr laboratory sessions and is aimed at upper-level undergraduate students in biochemistry or molecular biology courses. The project provides students with hands-on experience with RT-qPCR, the current gold standard for gene expression analysis, including detailed data analysis using the common 2-CT method. Moreover, it provides a convenient starting point for many inquiry-driven projects addressing diverse questions concerning ecological biochemistry, naturally occurring genetic variation, developmental biology, and the regulation of gene expression in nature.

AB Over the past two years, through an NSF RCN UBE grant, the ASBMB has held regional workshops for faculty members from around the country. The workshops have focused on developing lists of Core Principles or Foundational Concepts in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a list of foundational skills, and foundational concepts from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics that all Biochemistry or Molecular Biology majors must understand to complete their major coursework. The allied fields working group created a survey to validate foundational concepts from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics identified from participant feedback at various workshops. One-hundred twenty participants responded to the survey and 68% of the respondents answered yes to the question: We have identified the following as the core concepts and underlying theories from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics that Biochemistry majors or Molecular Biology majors need to understand after they complete their major courses: 1) mechanical concepts from Physics, 2) energy and thermodynamic concepts from Physics, 3) critical concepts of structure from chemistry, 4) critical concepts of reactions from Chemistry, and 5) essential Mathematics. In your opinion, is the above list complete? Respondents also delineated subcategories they felt should be included in these broad categories. From the results of the survey and this analysis the allied fields working group constructed a consensus list of allied fields concepts, which will help inform Biochemistry and Molecular Biology educators when considering the ASBMB recommended curriculum for Biochemistry or Molecular Biology majors and in the development of appropriate assessment tools to gauge student understanding of how these concepts relate to biochemistry and molecular biology.

AB Graduate students in chemistry, and in biological and biomedical fields must learn the fundamentals and practices of peptide and protein chemistry as early as possible. A project-oriented approach was conducted by first-year M.Sc and Ph.D students in biological sciences. A blind glass slide containing a cellular smear and an aqueous cellular extract were offered to the students. Qualitative and quantitative cell morphological parameters were analyzed by atomic force microscopy. The fractionation of the aqueous extract was conducted by reversed-phase chromatography followed by analysis of the isolated and partially purified proteins and peptides by mass spectrometry (MS). The proteins were treated by peptidases and the obtained peptide fragments were sequenced by de novo MS/MS, together with peptides already present in the extract. The most abundant protein fractions were identified as the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin from an amphibian of the Leptodactylus genera. Two of the peptides sequenced by the students were synthesized by the solid-phase methodology, one of those being obtained by the split-and-pool library synthesis method. Thus, the students were able to learn some advanced principles and practices of protein chemistry and bionanotechnology in a 6-weeks project-oriented approach.

AB DNA extraction provides a hands-on introduction to DNA and enables students to gain real life experience and practical knowledge of DNA. Students gain a sense of ownership and are more enthusiastic when they use their own DNA. A cost effective, simple protocol for DNA extraction and visualization was devised. Buccal mucosal epithelia provide a readily available source of cells for DNA extraction and can be harvested in a painless, noninvasive manner. Seven criteria were established to evaluate the protocol: Safety, DNA yield, DNA quality/stability, cost, user friendliness, reliability, and time. To identify the optimum conditions for each stage of the protocol (cell harvest, lysis, purification, and precipitation), each was investigated separately, and an adaptation of the fast-boiling protocol was used for the remaining stages. A validation study was undertaken with the optimized protocol to assess its performance when conducted by a group of students in a classroom setting. The optimum protocol used an isotonic Lucozade Hydro Active Fitness Water (HAFW) mouthwash. Lysis was achieved using a TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) + 1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) buffer. Protein was then digested using Proteinase K (Qiagen Inc., UK) at 56 degrees C for 10 min. The DNA was then precipitated with sodium chloride and absolute ethanol. This protocol achieved an increase in DNA yield using readily available equipment and reagents at a lower per capita cost and is simple to use.

AB Health-related popular articles are easily found among media sources. With the increasing popularity of the internet, medical information - full of misconceptions - has become easily available to the lay people. The ability to recognize misconceptions may require good biomedical knowledge. In this sense, we decided to use articles from the internet as part of a formal exam to evaluate students' learning of Clinical and Applied Biochemistry (CAB). This test, known as the True-or-False (T-or-F) exam, is made up of statements found online that are judged by freshmen medical and nutrition students taking Basic Biochemistry. In the last four teaching-semesters, students' acceptance and responses to T-or-F exam on CAB were evaluated through questionnaires (using a 0-4 Likert scale). Results from 258 students revealed that 71, 87, and 94% of them believed, respectively, that the exam was (i) difficult, (ii) of good quality, and (iii) that using media-questions is relevant for evaluating the learning of CAB. Moreover, the average grade in the T-of-F exam was 5.85 (out of 10). This low average is probably because students are not familiarized with this sort of examination that does not emphasize on memorizations of biochemical pathways and processes - it instead evaluates mostly the comprehension and application of knowledge, levels 2 and 3 in Bloom's scale. Such conclusion was possible by analyzing 192 questions in four exams - 67% were at levels 2, 3 or above. This kind of media-based exam could be well applied to several other disciplines in health sciences.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have emerged as a viable platform to engage large numbers of students in real-world scientific practices. Historically, CUREs have been offered throughout science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curricula at both the introductory and advanced levels and have been facilitated by a variety of individuals, including faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate teaching assistants (GTAs).
   Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have emerged as a viable platform to engage large numbers of students in real-world scientific practices. Historically, CUREs have been offered throughout science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curricula at both the introductory and advanced levels and have been facilitated by a variety of individuals, including faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate teaching assistants (GTAs). This latter population, in particular, has increasingly been tasked with facilitating CUREs, yet they often receive little meaningful professional development to improve pedagogical skills vital to this type of instruction. To address this disparity, we designed and evaluated a semester-long intervention to support GTAs (N = 7) responsible for leading CUREs at our institution during the Fall 2020 semester. Intervention activities included synchronous interactive discussions, reflective journaling, and asynchronous practical exercises. Analysis of retrospective postintervention survey responses and focus group interview data revealed that participants exhibited gains in their understanding of the dimensions of CUREs, strategies for mentoring undergraduates, and use of various pedagogical techniques as well as confidence in addressing and adopting those dimensions and strategies in their courses. Furthermore, participants reported finding value in the sense of community created through the intervention, which served as a means to share ideas and struggles throughout the term.

AB Service-learning and undergraduate research experiences are high-impact practices that have become more common in the sciences, but the benefits of short-term experiences have not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare within-semester gains for students in a short-term service-learning (SL) or short-term research project (RP) in terms of students' (i) motivation to learn biology, (ii) scientific literacy, (iii) perception of the relevance of biology to their lives, and (iv) learning gains associated with course learning outcomes.
   Service-learning and undergraduate research experiences are high-impact practices that have become more common in the sciences, but the benefits of short-term experiences have not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare within-semester gains for students in a short-term service-learning (SL) or short-term research project (RP) in terms of students' (i) motivation to learn biology, (ii) scientific literacy, (iii) perception of the relevance of biology to their lives, and (iv) learning gains associated with course learning outcomes. The impacts of brief service-learning and research project experiences were compared using direct and indirect assessments, including qualitative coding of open-ended response questions and quantitative analysis of exams and Likert-type items. We found few differences between students in the two projects regarding their changes in motivation (both slightly negative), scientific literacy (both gains), and their ability to connect biology to their lives (both gains). Emergent themes revealed that both projects influenced students' plans for future research and service-learning. Both projects helped students build relationships; however, RP students built relationships with classmates, while SL students built relationships with community members. The positive experiences highlight the need for engaging science students through service-learning in addition to research.

AB Understanding why students choose to major in biology provides important insight into the motivations of biology majors. It is similarly important to investigate how biology majors perceive the discipline, including associated activities, such as independent research, which can influence students' interests in the field and likelihood to persist in science, engineering, technology, and math. However, there has been little work done examining biology student motivations and perceptions, particularly at non-research-intensive universities or after the COVID-19 pandemic started. To address this gap, we surveyed the first-year cohort of biology majors at a private, comprehensive university. We found that students largely reported choosing the major because of interest in the field and/or the fact that the major would prepare them for specific careers. We also found that students had skewed conceptions of several major subdisciplines of biology (ecology and evolution; cell and molecular biology; and anatomy and physiology). Finally, most students reported not knowing what independent research is or presented naive conceptions of research. Our work offers a characterization of how first-year students at our university perceive the discipline, and we conclude by discussing changes that our program has made to address these results as well as implications for instructors and biology administrators.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, universities across the globe quickly shifted to online education. Laboratory courses faced unique challenges and were forced to reevaluate learning objectives and identify creative projects to engage students online. This study describes a newly developed online immunology laboratory curriculum focused on vaccine development. The course incorporated learning objectives to teach the scientific process, key experimental design components, and immunology techniques to evaluate vaccine efficacy. The curriculum, a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), asked students to engage in the research literature, propose a vaccine design and assessment, and interpret mock results. Instructor evaluation of student work as well as student self-evaluations demonstrated that students met the curriculum's learning objectives. Additionally, results from the laboratory course assessment survey (LCAS) indicate that this curriculum incorporated the CURE elements of collaboration, discovery and relevance, and iteration.

ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
AB To broaden and emphasize the educational benefits of research to more biology majors in a course setting, we developed and assessed a microbiology-focused course-based undergraduate research experience that utilizes culture-based bacterial enumeration to compare contamination present on different ground beef sources (conventional versus organic). During the final 3 weeks of the quarter, students learned and practiced common microbiology techniques like dilution math, selective and differential media-based identification, and statistical analysis to evaluate data and test hypotheses. Students were assessed primarily via a formal lab report and a lab practical focused on evaluating process of science and quantitative reasoning skills. The majority of students could write hypotheses and describe variables but were challenged when asked to describe the limitations of the experiments that were conducted as part of this research project. Most students could perform Excel-based graphing and a t test, but many could not solve the complex dilution math required for this project. The greatest barriers to skills mastery represented microbiology-focused concepts, like understanding selective media biases and the nuances of multistep viable counting procedures and outcomes.

TI Teaching "Crafty Microbiology": Safely Teaching Hands-On Microbiology
   Skills at Home
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Using nontoxic craft items and disposable lab consumables, we have developed nine modules to teach fundamental, hands-on microbiology lab skills safely at home. These "Crafty" teaching modules can be paired with virtual instruction and/or data collected by an instructor to replicate traditional microbiology lab exercises that characterize an unknown microbe. Materials and procedures used were carefully chosen to best mimic the texture of media, represent microbial diversity, assess aseptic technique, and produce analyzable data from results. Some protocols build upon and extend previously unpublished ideas, while others provide novel methods. The lab skills include proper personal protective equipment usage and basic biosafety, aseptic technique, microscopy and staining, streaking for isolation, spread plating, serial dilutions, filtering, disk diffusion method, and modeling an epidemic. Each protocol includes a student handout with background, links to videos of the methods performed with microbes, a rationale for the pairing of craft and consumable lab supplies along with technique used, a video or image demonstration of the "Crafty" technique when needed, postlab questions, and an instructor guide. This resource was developed for an undergraduate microbiology course, and each lab is aligned with learning outcomes within the American Society for Microbiology's undergraduate curriculum guidelines. This work would also be useful for outreach and K-12 educators. The development of microbiology lab skills by all students, regardless of economic or health status, will lead to a more scientifically minded society.

TI Zooming into the Lab: Perspectives on Maintaining Undergraduate
   Biological Research through Computationally Adapted Remote Learning in
   Times of Crisis
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many academic institutions attempted to limit viral spread throughout their communities by suspending face-to-face student instruction. The rapid transition from inperson to remote learning dramatically altered student-instructor interactions and ushered in a new set of educational challenges. Despite recent publications by experienced researchers that address the impacts of remote instruction on undergraduate research at a holistic level, we currently lack evidence for successful implementation of best practices in a remote research environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, to enhance remote scientific experiences and improve the skills of young biologists facing uncertain challenges in their future academic careers, we make nine recommendations for best practices in maintaining quality undergraduate research experiences, especially for computationally adapted projects, during online learning periods in times of crisis. Based on our experience participating in an undergraduate Stanford Summer Research Program (SSRP) that was conducted entirely remotely during the summer of 2020, we describe nine recommendations for best practices that institutions, faculty mentors, and undergraduate mentees can execute to maintain a high quality of biological research. Further elucidating the ways in which distance learning can be improved at the undergraduate research level will offer insights into making the most out of remote biological research in the months and years ahead.

TI Some Believe, Not All Achieve: The Role of Active Learning Practices in
   Anxiety and Academic Self-Efficacy in First-Generation College Students

AB First-generation college students face a variety of barriers in higher education compared with their continuing-generation peers. Active learning practices in STEM classrooms can potentially narrow the achievement gap by increasing academic self-efficacy, or confidence in academic abilities. However, these practices can also provoke anxiety in students. Given that anxiety can impair cognitive performance, we sought to understand how first-generation students perceive active learning practices and whether these perceptions affect the anticipated benefits of active learning. As part of a larger study on pedagogical practices in anatomy and physiology courses at the community college level, we asked students to rate various active learning techniques on how much each provoked anxiety and how much each contributed to their learning. All students (N = 186) rated some techniques as more anxiety-provoking than others (e.g., cold calling); however, compared to continuing-generation students, first-generation students' ratings tended to be higher. First-generation students anticipated doing more poorly in a course and attained lower final grades. Notably, the use of active learning practices did not improve first-generation students' academic self-efficacy: by the end of term, academic self-efficacy decreased in non-white first-generation students whereas other students showed little change. When introducing active learning strategies, instructors may need to proactively address underrepresented minority students' emotional reactions and ensure that all students experience success with these practices early in a course as a way to bolster academic self-efficacy.

TI An Introductory Module and Experiments To Improve the Graphing Skills of
   Non-Science Majors
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Graphing allows for the succinct communication of scientific data and is therefore a critical learning objective in science curricula. Unfortunately, many students, particularly non-science majors, lack the necessary skills to prepare and interpret graphs. Many students are able to interpolate data and observe general trends but demonstrate only a cursory ability to contextualize their results. In this paper, we suggest an introductory module and graphing lessons to improve the quantitative skills of non-science majors. In each of these lessons, students go through four phases of data analysis: (a) collection; (b) graphing; (c) interpolation/trend detection (reading), and (d) determining the underlying mechanism resulting in the trends they observe (interpretation). By employing these activities, we are continuing to improve the scientific literacy of students.

DT Editorial Material
AB To emphasize the importance of public outreach and science communication within STEM, and to foster in students a greater appreciative understanding of the scientific content within their courses, the Science Library Project has students creating children's books about key course content. At the end of this project, the student writer-publishers are able to display their critical and creative work as they collaborate with local teachers in a networked conversation about science and multimodal communication. This innovative pedagogical approach to assessment is important both inside and outside of the Sciences because it participates in High Impact Practice (HIP) pedagogy to have students invest a significant amount of time and effort over an extended period of time as they participate in frequent, timely, and constructive feedback and, most importantly, have the opportunity to discover the relevance of their learning through real-world applications in the public demonstration of their book projects. This practical paper shares our approach to creating and implementing the Science Library Project that activates written and visual communication modes to motivate Science learners to engage with course concepts in deeper and creative ways.

DE agitation; hydrodynamic force; microbial growth; shake flasks;

AB Shake flask cultivation is a routine technique in microbiology and biotechnology laboratories where cell growth can be affected by the hydrodynamic conditions, which depend on the agitation velocity, shaking diameter, and shake flask size. Liquid agitation is implemented inherently to increase aeration, substrate transfer to the cells, and prevent sedimentation, disregarding the role of hydrodynamics in microbial growth and metabolism. Here, we present a simple approach to help standardize the hydrodynamic forces in orbital shakers to increase the experimental accuracy and reproducibility and give students a better knowledge of the significance of the agitation process in microbial growth.

AB Attrition from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) pipeline limits the number of graduates needed to meet STEM workforce demand and impedes efforts to diversify the workforce. Identifying factors that underlie academic success and STEM persistence is an important component to increasing the number of STEM graduates. The current study utilizes the social influence process indicators of the Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence to investigate effects of course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) participation and to predict career intent in a diverse population. CURE participants experienced significant gains in scientific self-efficacy, scientific identity, and career intent, while students in control courses did not. Between-groups analysis showed that scientific self-efficacy and scientific identity increased significantly more for CURE participants than for non-CURE participants. Regression analysis revealed that scientific identity was the only significant predictor of a student's career intent. This work underscores the central importance of prioritizing scientific identity in STEM curricula to improve throughput in the STEM pipeline and illustrates the usefulness of CUREs as viable interventions to positively influence factors that promote STEM career intent.

ID FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN
AB Research in a range of disciplines shows that many undergraduate students struggle with aggregating complex knowledge components into a complete picture and incorporating research literature into the learning process. To build and improve on the practice of project-based approaches to teaching cell biology, we transformed an undergraduate cell biology class by introducing the concept of storylines that are selected by groups of students for development throughout the semester. Each storyline integrates molecular and organellar concepts discussed during the semester into the cell- and tissue-level functions, conditions, or diseases shared and discussed during online poster sessions. Three semester-long studies conducted with an undergraduate cell biology class utilized pre- and postassignment assessments of self-efficacy and content knowledge (administered three times during the semester), and these studies showed that both parameters were significantly improved following each assignment. Specifically, student self-efficacy showed large gains, preassignment to postassignment (pre-post) [F-(1,F-13) = 47.8, P < .001], and content knowledge showed moderate pre-post gains [F-(1,F-12) = 14.5, P < 0.002]. Attitude surveys administered at the end of the semester suggest that the approach is seen as beneficial and enriching. We conclude that it is possible to integrate multiple levels of material in a complicated class by using storytelling and that such integration is positive and useful.

AB Test anxiety is a common experience shared by college students and is typically investigated in the context of traditional, face-to-face courses. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the closure of universities, and many students had to rapidly shift to and balance the challenges of online learning. We investigated how the shift to online learning during the pandemic impacted trait (habitual) and state (momentary) test anxiety and whether there was variation across different demographic groups already vulnerable to performance gaps in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. Quantitative analyses revealed that trait and state test anxiety were lower in Spring 2020 (COVID semester) than in Spring 2019 and were higher overall in women than men. We did not find a difference in either trait or state anxiety in first-generation students or among persons excluded because of ethnicity or race. Qualitative analyses revealed that student priorities shifted away from coursework during Spring 2020. While students initially perceived the shift to online learning as beneficial, I month after the shift, students reported more difficulties studying and completing their coursework. Taken together, these results are the first to compare reports of test anxiety during a traditional, undisrupted semester to the semester where COVID-19 forced a sudden transition online.

DT Article
AB Research papers are a common end-of-semester assessment for senior-level seminars. The mid-semester switch to remote learning due to COVID-19 allowed for the opportunity to rethink this model and to provide for an alternative final assessment using a multi-part online portfolio that addresses the learning goals of the course and the objectives of research paper-based final assessments. The smaller weekly tasks coupled with ongoing peer feedback reduced student stress and allowed for creativity and community building. Students responded positively to the novel assignment.

TI An Activity to Promote Recognition of Unintentional Plagiarism in
   Scientific Writing in Undergraduate Biology Courses
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID ONLINE PLAGIARISM; STUDENTS
AB Unintentional plagiarism frequently occurs in undergraduate writing assignments because students are unaware of the complexity of correct paraphrasing and citation rules. There is often a lack of formal instruction in science courses on proper paraphrasing and citation to reduce plagiarism. To address this deficit, we developed a brief activity to teach students to recognize the range of paraphrasing and citation errors that can result in plagiarism. The activity was used in a biology-focused scientific literacy course, but it can be incorporated into different instructional settings, with undergraduate students of all levels. During this classroom activity, part 1 addresses the nuances associated with proper paraphrasing and citation in scientific writing and part 2 asks students to practice paraphrasing and properly citing a passage from a scientific source. Pretest results revealed that students were proficient at identifying plagiarism when a citation error occurred but were less proficient at recognizing improper paraphrasing (patchwriting or direct plagiarism). Posttest results indicated that the activity was effective at increasing the students' ability to recognize a paraphrasing error even when a correct citation was present. Students also reported higher confidence in their understanding of what constitutes plagiarism and that they are more confident in their ability to properly paraphrase and cite scientific source content.

TI A Reading-Writing Assignment Based on Popular Literature To Enhance
   Learning about Microbiology
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to stimulate engagement in microbiology, a reading-writing assignment based on a narrative popular science book was created for a one-semester introductory microbiology course. In order to encourage critical thinking, students were required to formulate a question related to the book to research and report on. Active learning was supported by guidance and feedback at each stage of the assignment. The assignment components were graded according to a rubric based on the learning outcomes: reading comprehension, question formulation, literature research, synthesis, and written communication. Median scores for the assignment components indicated that students successfully demonstrated the learning outcomes. A question was included on the final examination, asking students to summarize their most important learning from the assignment. Qualitative analysis of the exam answers revealed a wide variety of lessons learned about the practical applications of microbiology. On average, students scored better on the assignment and the assignment-related exam question than on the final exam. There was no significant correlation between a student's performance on the final exam and their performance on either of the assignment-related assessments, suggesting that the assignment benefited students regardless of their exam-taking capability. According to surveys administered at the end of the introductory microbiology course and again when students were enrolled in a senior microbiology course, a strong majority of students found the reading-writing assignment to be engaging and informative. This assignment may be modified in various ways in order to suit the needs of other courses.

AB The initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the nature of course delivery from largely in-person to exclusively remote, thus disrupting the well-established pedagogy of the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://www.thegep.org). However, our web-based research adapted well to the remote learning environment. As usual, students who engaged in the GEP's Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) received digital projects based on genetic information within assembled Drosophila genomes. Adaptations for remote implementation included moving new member faculty training and peer Teaching Assistant office hours from in-person to online. Surprisingly, our faculty membership significantly increased and, hence, the number of supported students. Furthermore, despite the mostly virtual instruction of the 2020-2021 academic year, there was no significant decline in student learning nor attitudes. Based on successfully expanding the GEP CURE within a virtual learning environment, we provide four strategic lessons we infer toward democratizing science education. First, it appears that increasing access to scientific research and professional development opportunities by supporting virtual, cost-free attendance at national conferences attracts more faculty members to educational initiatives. Second, we observed that transitioning new member training to an online platform removed geographical barriers, reducing time and travel demands, and increased access for diverse faculty to join. Third, developing a Virtual Teaching Assistant program increased the availability of peer support, thereby improving the opportunities for student success. Finally, increasing access to web-based technology is critical for providing equitable opportunities for marginalized students to fully participate in research courses. Online CUREs have great potential for democratizing science education.

AB Self-regulated learning (SRL) is the process of utilizing effective strategies to acquire knowledge or skills and is influenced by motivation, metacognitive processing, and study-related behaviors. We hypothesized that by using survey tools that allow reflection on and refinement of students' study strategies, we could nurture metacognitive skill development, encourage positive motivation and study-related behaviors, and hence promote academic success. Undergraduate students in a semester-long, second-year biology course were provided with resources to promote SRL and three survey instruments that encouraged them to create study plans and reflect on the effectiveness of their study strategies. Using a student-partnered approach, we sought to investigate the role of metacognition, motivation, and study-related behaviors on academic performance by (i) identifying the self-regulated learning strategies most utilized by students, (ii) investigating the role of reflection in enhancing metacognitive processing and academic performance, and (iii) understanding whether students created and/or modified their study strategies as an outcome of self-regulation. Survey responses allowed us to understand the repertoire of study strategies used by students. Our analyses suggest that students demonstrated metacognitive skill development through the use of the resources and reflection instruments, as they accurately reported on the effectiveness of their study strategies and indicated future plans to shift study-related behaviors from passive to active reviewing techniques. Students across the grade spectrum perceived the reflection instruments as beneficial in identifying areas of improvement and developing long-term study habits, suggesting that these instruments were effective in promoting metacognitive skill development for a variety of student learners. We conclude that supporting students with resources that promote SRL and providing opportunities for timely reflection can promote metacognitive skill development, a key feature of academic success.

AB Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to human health. Education on antibiotics is essential for AMR prevention, and training should be provided for undergraduate pharmacy students. This study evaluated the knowledge regarding antibiotic use and AMR among fourth-year Japanese pharmacy students and the effect of a lecture on treating infectious diseases with antibiotics had on their knowledge. A questionnaire survey was conducted, and the responses were recorded before and after participants attended the lecture. A small subset of the prelecture survey questions was used for the postlecture survey. From a total of 540 participants, 330 and 234 responses were collected before and after the lecture, respectively. In the prelecture survey, 39.4% of the participants incorrectly answered that antibiotics can effectively treat the common cold, 13.3% had taken leftover antibiotics, and 17.3% had taken antibiotics prescribed for their family members or others. Furthermore, the prelecture survey data showed that the mean number (+/- standard deviation) of correct answers across the eight questions on treatment and diagnosis of infectious diseases and antibiotics was 2.21 +/- 1.64. However, in the postsurvey, this figure increased to 5.00 +/- 1.82. Although the lecture improved their knowledge to some extent, the results suggested that fourth-year pharmacy students have inaccurate knowledge regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics and AMR. Therefore, it is necessary to improve early-year undergraduate pharmacy education on antibiotics in Japan.
   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to human health. Education on antibiotics is essential for AMR prevention, and training should be provided for undergraduate pharmacy students.

TI Mendelian or Multifactorial? Current Undergraduate Genetics Assessments
   Focus on Genes and Rarely Include the Environment

AB Undergraduate genetics courses have historically focused on simple genetic models, rather than taking a more multifactorial approach where students explore how traits are influenced by a combination of genes, the environment, and gene-by-environment interactions. While a focus on simple genetic models can provide straightforward examples to promote student learning, they do not match the current scientific understanding and can result in deterministic thinking among students. In addition, undergraduates are often interested in complex human traits that are influenced by the environment, and national curriculum standards include learning objectives that focus on multifactorial concepts. This research aims to discover to what extent multifactorial genetics is currently being assessed in undergraduate genetics courses. To address this, we analyzed over 1,000 assessment questions from a commonly used undergraduate genetics textbook; published concept assessments; and open-source, peer-reviewed curriculum materials. Our findings show that current genetics assessment questions overwhelmingly emphasize the impact of genes on phenotypes and that the effect of the environment is rarely addressed. These results indicate a need for the inclusion of more multifactorial genetics concepts, and we suggest ways to introduce them into undergraduate courses.

AB ePortfolios are digital repositories where students can curate papers, projects, and reflections from individual or multiple courses across the disciplines and in a variety of formats to showcase their learning. This transparent and portable medium, which enables students to document their knowledge and abilities for assessment and career development, has been recognized by the American Association of Colleges and Universities as one of 11 high-impact practices. Using tailored rubrics, student assessment of learning gain surveys, and end-of-course exam questions, this study demonstrates how an ePortfolio assignment can be used in microbiology courses taken by majors and nonmajors to measure student learning outcomes in several course and program learning goals. Additionally, it helps students reflect on their learning and place it in a real-world context by connecting science, microbiology, and microbes with issues of social importance like cholera, gender equity, and antibiotic resistance. Writing from a first-person perspective and drawing on resources obtained in class and from their own research, students generate profiles for a chosen microbe and document the microbe's characteristics in creative ways. The ePortfolio assignment can also be partnered with creative work such as an art piece or a poem that highlights and showcases the microbe in a format that is accessible to the public to increase awareness of the role of microbes in our ecosystems. With careful design and construction of assignments, ePortfolios can also be leveraged to promote civic and scientific literacy by tying classroom content to real-world issues of civic importance.

LA English
DT Article

   exams
AB The article documents students' experiences with the shift online at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and provides informed recommendations to STEM instructors regarding academic integrity and student stress. Over 500 students were surveyed on these topics, including an open-ended question. Students experienced more stress and perceived a greater workload in online courses and therefore preferred in-person courses overall. Personal awareness of cheating during online exams is positively correlated with the proportion of cheating a student perceives. Fear of getting caught is the best cheating deterrent while getting a better grade makes cheating most enticing. Randomization of questions and answer choices is perceived as a highly effective tool to reduce cheating and is reported as the least stress-inducing method. Inability to backtrack and time limits cause students the most stress. Students report that multiple choice questions are the least effective question type to discourage cheating and oral exam questions cause the most stress. Use of camera and lockdown browser or being video- and audio- recorded caused the majority of student stress. Yet, nearly 60% agree that the combination of camera and lockdown browser is an effective deterrent. Recommendations: (i) Be transparent regarding academic dishonesty detection methods and penalties. (ii) Use online invigilating tools. (iii) Synchronize exams and (iv) randomize exam questions. (v) Allow backtracking. (vi) Avoid converting in-person exams to online exams; instead, explore new ways of designing exams for the online environment.

AB Making inferences and reasoning with new scientific information is critical for successful performance in biology coursework. Thus, identifying students who are weak in these skills could allow the early provision of additional support and course placement recommendations to help students develop their reasoning abilities, leading to better performance and less attrition within biology courses. Researchers across universities partnered to develop a measure to assess students' inference-making abilities in biology. We describe the development of the inference-making and reasoning in biology assessment (IMRB). The IMRB is a 15-item multiple-choice assessment that uses short paragraphs of content-from the most-used textbook-taught at the end of a semester of survey biology courses designed for science majors. Based on our research, when the IMRB is conducted at the beginning of a semester, it measures deductive reasoning with new biology information, is fair across various student groups, and is reliable. The IMRB can be used with or without SAT or ACT scores to place students into regular undergraduate introductory biology courses, to predict grades in such courses, and/or to identify students who may need extra support or remediation in reasoning with new biology information. The IMRB is available free of charge to interested faculty and researchers.

AB Research-based courses are a powerful way to engage undergraduates in the scientific process while simultaneously teaching participants relevant laboratory, analysis, and scientific communication skills. In most programs, students conduct a simulated project which effectively improves student conceptions of scientific thinking but does not produce research-quality data. The course described here delivered an authentic research experience by assigning undergraduates an objective from an active grant-funded project. Participants contributed to research aimed at culturing biodegrading thermophiles from hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. Students participated in a backcountry field experience, collecting environmental samples of their choosing and determining appropriate culturing conditions. Following high-temperature incubations, 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified enriched microbial populations, with analytical and microscopy methods tracking degradation and growth. Importantly, several teams successfully cultivated thermophilic plastic-degrading consortia. Student learning was assessed using several methods, including grade distributions on assignments and statistical comparisons of pre- and posttests. A consistent and, in most cases, statistically significant increase was observed in the students' posttest scores. The grade distribution on summative assessments also suggests that students achieved the desired learning outcomes. Student perceptions of their learning and experience gains were high, with participants reporting improvements in components emphasized in the research activities. Overall, the findings highlight how involving undergraduates in real-world research projects can enhance student interest and ownership of scientific research, along with contributing quality data that inform active studies.

TI Analysis of a COVID-19 Clinical Trial to Emphasize Experimental Design

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
AB Increasing student exposure to primary literature in early biology coursework can enhance scientific literacy and quantitative reasoning skills. The efficacy of primary literature discussion is heavily impacted by article selection, as student engagement is optimal with material that is topical and has clear relevance to real world issues. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of COVID-19-related scientific research in the mainstream media makes it an ideal topic for current discussion in entry-level biology courses. Here, we present an activity developed to facilitate a remote, synchronous discussion of an open access clinical trial publication on the experimental drug remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 (Beigel et al., 2020, N Engl J Med https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2007764). The activity, which is amenable to adaptation for other research articles, emphasizes concepts in experimental design, statistical analysis, graphical interpretation, and the structure, content, and organization of typical sections of a primary research article. Importantly, the activity highlights the utility of the classroom response tool Pear Deck, a Google Slides add-on, for creating engaging literature discussions that can be readily adapted to a wide variety of teaching modalities.

AB As most instruction has been forced online, biology instructors have become acutely aware of the many advantages and limitations of online teaching. Here, we investigate one possible advantage of online education: the ease of allowing remote guest speakers to interact with students in real time. In particular, we piloted a model in which guest speakers could facilitate direct music-related interactions with students, possibly benefiting students' content knowledge and sense of community. In the context of an undergraduate animal physiology course, face-to-face lessons on arterial blood gases and the renal system were supplemented with videoconferences with a guest speaker who presented relevant content-rich songs and led class discussions of the lyrics. Survey and test data suggested that, after each of the lessons, the students (i) had increased confidence in their understanding of the material, (ii) performed better on objective test questions, and (iii) attributed their learning chiefly to the musical intervention. While our approach awaits further exploration and testing, this report provides preliminary evidence of its feasibility and offers practical suggestions for others who may wish to give it a try.

ID PROJECT OWNERSHIP; BENEFITS
AB While it has been established that course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) lead to student benefits, it is less clear what aspects of CUREs lead to such gains. In this study, we aimed to understand the effect of students analyzing their own data, compared with students analyzing data that had been collected by professional scientists. We compared the experiences of students in a CURE investigating whether the extinction risk status of terrestrial mammals and birds is associated with their ecological traits. Students in the CURE were randomly assigned to analyze either data that they had collected or data previously collected by professional scientists. All other aspects of the student experience were designed to be identical. We found that students who analyzed their own data showed significantly greater gains in scientific identity and emotional ownership than students who analyzed data collected by professional scientists.

ID HELP-SEEKING
AB The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between learning strategies (LS) and problem solving (PS) in microbiology. Microbiology problems utilized for the study were from educational software known as "Interactive Multimedia Exercises" (IMMEX). Problem-solving performances measured included: the ability to solve, scores obtained and elapsed time. It was hypothesized that there would be a good correlation between students' LS and PS. Since many factors besides learning strategies predict performance, alpha was set at 0.10. Participants (N = 65) solved two sets of microbiology problems "Microquest" (Mq), which focuses on microbial cellular processes and mode of action of antibiotics, and "Creeping crud" (Cc), which focuses on the cause, origin, and transmission of diseases. Participants also responded to the adapted Motivated Strategy Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) using a five-point Likert scale. Scores for LS were determined by averaging the item responses of participants. Regression analysis was used to determine significance, with Grade Point Average (GPA) as a control. Of the 65 participants 48 (73.8%) successfully solved Mq while 52 (80%) solved Cc. Metacognitive self-regulated strategy was significantly (p < 0.10) related to ability to solve Cc. Peer learning strategy showed a significant (p < 0.10) relationship with Cc scores. Time spent solving Cc was significantly more than time spent on Mq (p < 0.001). These findings emphasize the fact that metacognition and peer learning are positive predictors for problem solving and could potentially improve learning outcomes in microbiology. The implications for curriculum development are discussed.

TI Facilitating Growth through Frustration: Using Genomics Research in a
   Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; MOTIVATION
AB A hallmark of the research experience is encountering difficulty and working through those challenges to achieve success. This ability is essential to being a successful scientist, but replicating such challenges in a teaching setting can be difficult. The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP) is a consortium of faculty who engage their students in a genomics Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). Students participate in genome annotation, generating gene models using multiple lines of experimental evidence. Our observations suggested that the students' learning experience is continuous and recursive, frequently beginning with frustration but eventually leading to success as they come up with defendable gene models. In order to explore our "formative frustration" hypothesis, we gathered data from faculty via a survey, and from students via both a general survey and a set of student focus groups. Upon analyzing these data, we found that all three datasets mentioned frustration and struggle, as well as learning and better understanding of the scientific process. Bioinformatics projects are particularly well suited to the process of iteration and refinement because iterations can be performed quickly and are inexpensive in both time and money. Based on these findings, we suggest that a dynamic of "formative frustration" is an important aspect for a successful CURE.

ID CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION; DIVERSITY; IDENTITY
AB Educators realize the need to provide an inclusive, safe environment in a diverse classroom setting to encourage discussion of sensitive topics. However, descriptions of evidence-based approaches that may help us to meet inclusive pedagogy-related competencies are limited. Here, we describe a discussion format that followed chapter readings from a nonfiction biographical book called Mountains beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, a Man Who Would Cure the World (2003), by Tracy Kidder. This semester-long effort allowed sufficient time for students to develop an understanding of global public health affairs and to reflect on their own role in this world as responsible citizens. A discussion around several sensitive issues emerged, such as the extent of their belief in faith versus science, their opinion on providing financial aid to developing countries versus addressing public health issues in their home country, stereotypes and how that may spread panic during a public-health emergency. The student essays provided evidence that activities were successful in 1) drawing out students' voices about world affairs, 2) teaching students to empathize with varied belief systems, 3) helping students develop a deeper appreciation of empirical and ethical factors that may affect such issues-all of which are key competencies for an inclusive classroom setting. We believe that the activities are flexible in structure and could be easily incorporated into a biology or liberal arts classroom setting to achieve inclusive pedagogy-related goals.

TI Collaborative Learning Tools To Foster Inclusive Participation and Sense
   of Belonging in a Microbiology Outreach Partnership
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB For secondary outreach programs to meet the goals of enhancing science education and attracting future scientists from underrepresented populations, we need an inclusive approach that integrates students' knowledge and experiences in the process of doing science. I present three pedagogical tools designed by developing equitable, inclusive collaboration among microbiologist outreach mentors and high school biology students. These activities aim to foster a sense of belonging in a scientific community and serve as an entry point to the practice of inclusion. Over a one-semester course at an alternative high school, ten secondary students and their scientist mentors met weekly to design and conduct microbiology experiments together. This group of students and scientists participated in structured collaborative learning activities to: i) understand each other's ideas about science; ii) collectively analyze their research findings; and iii) offer peer feedback. I modified the following three learning tools for use in my secondary science classroom from protocols of the National School Reform Faculty: 1) the Quotes Introduction Activity set the stage for equitable discourse between high school students and scientist mentors, while initiating important conversations about the process of biological research; 2) the Data Analysis Protocol allowed both students and mentors to contribute to the scientific process; and 3) the Feedback Carousel Activity engaged students and scientists alike in reviewing and refining poster presentations. This inclusive engagement in the social aspects of learning science can help students feel a sense of belonging and imagine their futures in the scientific community, key steps towards inclusion. The supportive system of structured feedback in these collaborative learning activities created a safe, inclusive space for secondary students to try on the role of microbiology expert, and for scientist volunteers to practice inclusive mentorship. Drawing from inclusive pedagogical tools in secondary education will help expand our capacity for inclusive science outreach and bring us closer to the goals of improving biology education and attracting future biologists at the university level.

While relevant to our everyday lives, many popular press science articles overstate conclusions, misstate details or, at worst, purposefully spread disinformation.
   Even before coverage and updates on COVID-19 became a daily event in mainstream news, mass media was already full of science-focused current events stories. While relevant to our everyday lives, many popular press science articles overstate conclusions, misstate details or, at worst, purposefully spread disinformation. This iterative news analysis and writing intervention was designed to increase the visibility of real-world applications of microbiology in current events (including and beyond the 2019 coronavirus disease [COVID-19] pandemic), thereby engaging students and cultivating motivation through a positive perception of course content in accordance with expectancy-value theory. This intervention can be scaled and has been successfully used in both large- and small-enrollment microbiology classes as an active learning strategy. Students engage in science literacy at multiple levels, starting with identifying credible sources, then summarizing news articles, relating them to course content, conveying the main ideas to lay audiences, identifying in turn misleading or omitted ideas, and finally writing potential exam questions on the topic. This multifaceted analysis allows students to interact with material at many different levels in a self-directed manner as students seek out and choose articles to share with their peers. To date, anecdotal evidence suggests positive gains in student interest and perceived value of studying science.

AB A growing body of literature shows that primary scientific literature (PSL) is a valuable and useful tool for science, technology, engineering, and math education. We currently have a relatively limited understanding of how skills relating to reading PSL progress through academic careers, i.e., the process by which expertise in reading PSL develops. In this study, we built on previous work showing clear differences in strategies that experts use to read PSL that are not often available to or documented with novice PSL readers. Using the five core concepts (5CCs) of biology, outlined in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology, as a framework for student engagement with PSL, we investigated whether the 5CCs can be used to (i) increase student engagement with PSL, (ii) provide a context for PSL, and (iii) integrate student prior knowledge when reading PSL. Second, we investigated whether a 5CCs-based, semester-long intervention could shift student reading habits to be more expert-like. As no direct assessment for this exists, we instead measured student motivation for reading PSL, their Biology identity, and their perceived learning gains in science. We found that, through the use of the 5CCs as a framework for reading PSL, students were able to integrate previous knowledge and engaged with PSL constructively. Additionally, we saw positive shifts in student motivation for reading PSL, student Biology identity, and student self-reported learning gains in Biology. Taken together, the 5CCs, as a disciplinary framework, have great potential as a pedagogical tool for increasing student engagement with PSL in Biology classrooms.

AB Understanding the mechanism for DNA mutations is a key concept in most genetics and microbiology courses. In addition, understanding that most mutations occur prior to exposure to selection is an important yet often difficult concept for students to grasp. We developed an undergraduate laboratory activity on mutation mechanisms based on the classic experiment from Luria and Delbruck. The activity uses Escherichia coil as the model organism and the antibiotic streptomycin for selection. Students gain handson experience with an important experiment in genetics, and the laboratory contains an investigative component in having students calculate mutation rate for streptomycin resistance and in having the students design a follow-up experiment. E. coli has a knockout collection available, and we used a wild-type strain and a Delta mutS strain in the laboratory exercise. The Delta mutS strain is missing an enzyme in the mismatch repair pathway, and students calculate and compare the mutation rate and frequency for both the wild type and the knockout strain. Assessment of student learning showed that students had a significant gain in understanding of mutational mechanisms. An optional, additional experiment involving PCR and DNA sequencing of streptomycin-resistant mutants is also presented.

AB A call for the integration of research experiences into all biology curricula has been a major goal for educational reform efforts nationally. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been the predominant method of accomplishing this, but their associated costs and complex design can limit their wide adoption. In 2020, the COVID-I9 pandemic forced programs to identify unique ways to still provide authentic research experiences while students were virtual. We report here a complete guide for the successful implementation of a semester-long virtual CURE that uses Drosophila behavioral assays to explore the connection between pain and addiction with the use of an at-home "lab-in-a-box." Individual components were piloted across three semesters and launched as a 100-level introductory course with 19 students. We found that this course increased science identity and successfully improved key research competencies as per the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) survey. This course is ideal for flipped classrooms ranging from introductory to upper-level biology/neuroscience courses and can be integrated directly into the lecture period without the need for building a new course. Given the low cost, recent comfort with virtual learning environments, and current proliferation of flipped classrooms following the 2020 pandemic, this curriculum could serve as an ideal project-based active-learning tool for equitably increasing access to authentic research experiences.

TI Adjusting Expectations: The Impact of 2020 Campus Closures on Advisors'
   Approaches to Graduate Student Mentorship
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The spring 2020 campus closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have posed particular challenges related to the mentorship of science graduate students. In this study, science faculty mentors from one U.S. university report on potential delays to degree completion and their expectations of their mentees during this time. Nearly half of the faculty advisors surveyed expected their graduate student mentees to experience delayed time to graduation. Respondents also described making an effort to support their mentees through providing encouragement and identifying research-related goals students could complete remotely. One-quarter of respondents stated that they were not altering their expectations for their mentees. The respondents who did report having altered expectations varied between altering their immediate expectations and changing their overall expectations for degree completion. These findings relate not only to the immediate impact on graduate mentees but also to the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on graduate education in the United States.

TI Undergraduate Research in the Time of COVID-19: A Remote Imaging
   Protocol for Physically Distanced Students Studying Wildlife
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered many university research labs because campuses are closed, and faculty and students lack productive ways of working remotely. This presents major difficulties for students who need research opportunities to fulfill their intellectual growth potential and their undergraduate research and thesis requirements. Without research experiences, undergraduates may be less competitive for future jobs and graduate programs. Similarly, faculty need research avenues to advance their academic careers while maintaining physically distant protocols. We outline here a budget-friendly, COVID-friendly, adaptable protocol that aims to introduce students to the wildlife research opportunities surrounding their campus or home through observation and literature research. Student researchers learn the scientific method by getting first-hand experience with an original research project. The pedagogical goals include designing a study: defining a question or proposing a hypothesis, collecting, organizing, and analyzing data, and sharing results in the form of posters, theses, informal educational materials, and scientific publications. This protocol is flexible to allow for different budgets, opportunities, and constraints. The researchers monitor different locations using trail cameras to determine which species are present around campus or even students' homes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when it is likely there will be few in-person meetings, this protocol offers students the opportunity to carry out research with limited or no in-person meetings, and it can be run remotely by sharing the data collected. In this paper, we provide instructions, details, and student handouts for instructors to help implement this research project.

TI Facilitating Long-Term Mentoring To Effectively Implement Active
   Learning Instruction: Formation of the Promoting Active Learning and
   Mentoring (PALM) Network
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; STEM
AB A large body of data suggests that implementing active learning practices in a STEM classroom contributes to increased success in both achievement of student learning outcomes and retention of students. Despite these findings, significant barriers exist for instructors implementing active learning strategies in their undergraduate classrooms. These barriers can be effectively addressed by providing sustained support to instructors and postdoctoral trainees interested in implementing active learning strategies in their teaching practice. The Promoting Active Learning and Mentoring (PALM) network attains this objective by connecting instructors interested in learning more about active learning (Fellows) with individuals who have extensive expertise related to this practice (mentors). These facilitated connections occur in the form of active mentorship for a year or more, virtual journal clubs, and biannual gatherings of PALM Fellows and mentors. Here, we describe the foundation on which PALM was built and explain how a successful mentorship program can pave the way for educators to adapt and implement evidence-based practices like active learning in a college classroom.

AB Despite recent interest and pressing need, we lack a clear model of culturally relevant, responsive, sensitive teaching in university STEM departments. Most culturally relevant efforts within STEM education address actions individual professors can take within their own classrooms and mentoring, rather than describing how to go about enacting cultural transformation at the departmental level. In this article, we propose the application of the Ladson-Billings model of culturally relevant pedagogy to promote an inclusive culture within undergraduate STEM departments. The model consists of three components: academic success, cultural competence and integrity, and critical consciousness. We define each component and describe what it looks like and how it can be used to guide departmental transformation, including examples in biology, physics, mathematics, and computer science departments at our own institution. This model can help guide faculty committed to creating departments where all kinds of STEM students can thrive, provided they are willing to work hard.

AB In the United States, persistence for women and ethnic minorities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers is strongly impacted by affective factors such as science identity, agency, and sense of belonging. Policies aimed at increasing the diversity of the national STEM student population and workforce have recently focused on fostering inclusive learning environments that can positively impact the experiences of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in STEM, thus increasing their retention. While research on inclusion in STEM in higher education is relatively new, inclusion research has a rich history in several other disciplines. These fields have developed theoretical frameworks and validated instruments to conceptualize and assess inclusion. Self-determination theory (SDT) is a well-established theoretical framework in educational psychology that states that ones' internal motivation is strongly correlated with the satisfaction of three specific psychological needs: autonomy, competency, and relatedness. In this paper, we introduce SDT and discuss how it relates to inclusion and to ongoing efforts to increase retention of STEM URM students in higher education environments. We argue that grounding inclusion initiatives in the SDT framework increases our understanding of the mechanisms mediating their impact, thus facilitating their reproducibility and generalizability. Finally, we describe how this theoretical framework has been adapted by the field of Industrial and Organizational Psychology to define and assess inclusion in the workplace as an example of how STEM education researchers can use this framework to promote and assess inclusion in their fields.

AB Graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) who are English language learners at American institutions often endure xenophobia, pressures to conform to American culture, and visa restrictions on working. Quantitative data we collected from the Introduction to Biology Laboratory course taught at a large R1 university indicate paper grading discrepancies between international and domestic GTAs. Qualitative data highlight international GTAs' concerns regarding grading load and language barriers. To alleviate the burden on international GTAs, we provide a professional development activity for professors to use in course planning meetings based on feedback from GTAs. Group reflection, discussion, and modification of a rubric are recommended in order to train GTAs in assessing scientific writing to collaboratively build expectations as a teaching team.

TI Collaborative Mentoring for Retaining Secondary Biology Teachers
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; IMPACT; SCIENCE
AB Veteran biology teachers are at risk of leaving the classroom due to burnout, feeling uninspired, and overall job dissatisfaction. One way to keep veteran teachers engaged is through continued mentoring. Yet current mentoring programs vary in scope, often focus too heavily on one-to-one talk, with mentors serving as therapists, and generally fail to include veteran teachers. Considering this is not how schools operate, we argue active mentoring for veteran teachers is best when embedded into regular school practice. Collaborative mentoring, as we have termed it, pairs experienced high school teachers with other veteran colleagues, including university professors, in professional development activities centering on improving classroom practices. We believe that collaborative mentoring holds potential to meet the needs of all stakeholders-high school students for support in learning laboratory and writing skills; university faculty for hands-on classroom work and reflective practice, as well as for sharing content and pedagogical knowledge with professionals in the field; and, specifically, veteran biology teachers for expanding access to meaningful professional development opportunities. Focusing on applicable classroom pedagogy serves as a cost-effective model for professional development for veteran teachers, possibly increasing job satisfaction and teacher retention in high schools across the nation.

AB Many studies confirm the benefit of active learning in STEM teaching. However, many faculty have been slow to adopt such practices, perhaps due to limited time to learn and implement new approaches. One way to address this deficit is to offer structured teaching postdoctoral experiences to trained scientists who want to enter academia. We outline the benefits of providing pedagogical training at the postdoctoral level and present a framework for structuring an impactful teaching postdoc program.

TI Problem-Solving Exercise for Undergraduate Students Involving the
   Japanese Fermented Food Natto
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID VITAMIN-K-2 MENAQUINONE-7
AB Natto is a traditional Japanese food made from soybeans fermented by Bacillus subtilis natto. Because natto is high in protein and contains healthful bacteria, dieticians and producers have campaigned for higher consumption of natto in areas such as Kansai, where our university is located. One of the reasons for the low consumption of natto is its distinctive flavor. As a problem-solving exercise, undergraduate students attempted to make natto more marketable. Students set a goal of modifying natto flavor by adding spices to achieve flavors deemed palatable by organoleptic tests. During the exercise, they noticed that lemongrass, Cymbopogon citratus, had a flavor-masking ability that reduced the intensity of natto flavor, and they finally determined that it was a useful food additive to make natto marketable. The exercise was an active learning process that effectively induced voluntary student effort of to solve problems originating from microorganisms.

AB Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) is a pedagogical approach that has been shown to benefit all students, especially underrepresented minority students and peer leaders in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. In this work, we present results from our study of the impact of PLTL on our peer leaders from a controlled implementation in general biology, general chemistry, and statistics courses at a Hispanic-serving, minority-serving institution. More specifically, we have measured our PLTL program's impact on our peer leaders' skill development, engagement with the subject material, and sense of belonging as peer leaders. Weekly peer leader reflections analyzed using the Dreyfus model exhibited a consistent set of skills, while those analyzed using the Pazos model revealed a consistent type of student-peer leader interactions, allowing for peer leaders to be assigned to specific levels in the hierarchy of each of the models. Analysis of eight skill-based Likert-scale questions on the SALG survey showed an overall positive shift at the highest level. Independent of the skill or interaction level of the peer leader, we observed several instances of peer leaders acknowledging development in their communication skills, sincere attempts at creating an engaging classroom, and a deep investment in their student's success. Peer leaders also reported improvements in understanding of the subjects they were teaching, wanting to persevere and solve problems independently, and feeling passionate about helping other students.

In comparable microbiology-related courses, scaffolded assignments to improve STEM literacy through data, information, and communication analysis skills were developed using the ASM Curriculum Guidelines and the Microbiology Course Inventory (MCI) to structure the course and assignments. Examples of such assignments included a meta-analysis using literature and bioinformatics, as well as a public data presentation and an epidemiological model based on current events. To evaluate the effectiveness of such approaches, assignment components were aligned to determine whether the activities reinforced the MCI concepts. Comparison of pre- and postcourse data indicated relative strengths (and weaknesses) addressed by scaffolded STEM literacy pedagogy. These efforts also contribute to a department-wide initiative to enhance career readiness and implementation of course assessments. Future goals are to broaden the integration of assignment components to other microbiology-related courses and have longitudinal assessment.

AB Diversifying the STEM workforce is a national priority, yet white males continue to dominate the ranks of professional scientists and engineers in the United States. This is partly due to disparities in academic success for women and minoritized students in prerequisite introductory STEM courses, leading to higher attrition from B.S. degree programs. Past research has demonstrated that when social-psychological interventions targeting "stereotype threat" or "fixed" mindsets are implemented in STEM courses, equity gaps may be significantly reduced. We incorporated two such interventions into introductory biology courses for life science B.S. majors and Associate's degree allied health students taught at a regional research university and a community college. We observed no significant effects of the values-affirmation interventions on grade outcomes for students in any of the courses, regardless of students' gender identity, race/ethnicity, or first-generation status, suggesting that students, on average, were not experiencing stereotype threat on either campus. We found a significant positive association between completing more weekly reflective journal entries and higher mean content-based grades for students in the university majors course overall, especially first-generation students, although the association was significantly negative for women. Our results confirm that context matters when implementing interventions aimed at reducing achievement gaps, and we propose that educators assess their students' social-psychological characteristics and then select interventions accordingly.

   undergraduate research experience (CURE); lab notebook; undergraduate
   research; data management; science communication
ID CONDUCT; INSTRUCTION
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) represent an innovative educational strategy to engage more science, technology, engineering, and math undergraduates in authentic research experiences. Research shows that student participation in CUREs results in positive student outcomes similar to those for traditional research experiences. However, less is known about how the research focus of a CURE or the varied emphasis on certain CURE design elements can impact student outcomes. CUREs provide a unique opportunity to infuse training essential for future researchers. Although responsible and ethical conduct is an important component of research and scientific practice, limited attention has been paid to incorporation and assessment of responsible and ethical conduct of research (RECR) in CUREs. Here, we address the gap in CURE RECR training by presenting an activity that can be easily built into any CURE or inquiry-based lab to train students in RECR relative to data management, specifically, the lab notebook. In this activity, students are asked to replicate or execute an experiment with only the records of a previous student's lab notebook. This previous student's notebook is purposefully designed by the instructor to miss important information that might not seem obvious to students but would prevent a future researcher from replicating the experiment. The idea is to create an early understanding of delayed gratification for students when it comes to responsible and ethical maintenance of lab notebooks. This activity is paired with a pre- and postactivity lecture and debriefing to instruct, guide, and reflect with students on RECR surrounding lab notebooks as well as iterative practice and assessment of lab notebooks throughout the semester.

TI Moving a Journal Article-Based Upper-Level Microbiology Dry Lab from
   In-Person to Online Instruction
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID FOOD MICROBIOLOGY; STUDENTS; BIOLOGY
AB During the spring semester of 2020, a journal article-based upper-level microbiology laboratory course was offered through Western New Mexico University at Glendale Community College in Glendale, AZ. Because most of the students had taken a lower-level microbiology class with a traditional wet laboratory, a dry lab format was used instead. In the first period of each 2-week cycle, a microbiology article selected by the instructor from the primary literature was discussed using a PowerPoint presentation and a detailed study sheet. Students then turned in answers to five specific questions about the article. In the second period of each 2-week cycle, students met to discuss possible research projects based on that article. They then turned in a two- to three-page research proposal describing their project. Before the COVID-19 pandemic became severe and the college moved to online instruction, there were active discussions between the instructor and the students in both class periods. After the campus was shut down, discussions of the journal articles and preparation of the research proposals were done online using Canvas as the learning platform. Students were provided with discussion sites, but no video instruction systems were used. In general, the answers to the journal article questions and the quality of the research proposals were better during in-person instruction. Instructors may be able to adapt this journal article-based lab approach to a fully online format, but it will require extensive training and the use of Zoom or other video instruction methods.

TI Remote Learning Barriers and Opportunities for Graduate Student and
   Postdoctoral Learners in Career and Professional Skill Development: A
   Case Study
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Career and professional development competencies are critical for biomedical PhD and postdoctoral training. In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly nonsequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-from-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes, as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even postpandemic, to reduce identified barriers. Alongside hybrid learning engagements, we strongly recommend structured time for learners to enhance their professional competencies, enabled by a commitment from departments and faculty mentors to bring equity in professional skill building and foster a lifelong growth mindset.

   Successful Redesign of the CONSERVE Summer Internship Program
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on education globally, forcing the teaching community to think outside the box and create innovative educational plans to benefit students at home. Here, we narrate how the undergraduate, laboratory-based Summer Internship Program of our CONSERVE Center of Excellence, which focuses heavily on engaging women and underrepresented minorities in STEM programming, took a turn from an in-person research experience to a fully virtual one. We share our challenges and how we overcame them. Additionally, we provide a description of our virtual internship professional development curriculum, as well as the creative research projects that our seven interns were able to achieve in an 8-week virtual internship, including projects focused on the microbiological water quality of recycled irrigation water; social media promotion, enhancement and marketing of online educational resources focused on water, microbial contamination, and food crop irrigation; decision support systems for using recycled water in agricultural settings; and the effectiveness of zero-valent iron sand filtration in improving agricultural water quality, to name a few. Upon evaluating our internship program, we observed that more than 80% of our interns were either very satisfied or satisfied with the overall virtual internship experience. Through this experience, both the educators and the interns learned that although a virtual laboratory internship cannot completely replace in-person learning, it can still result in a very meaningful educational experience.

TI Integrating Metacognitive Regulation into the Online Classroom Using
   Student-Developed Learning Plans
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Students and instructors have been faced with unexpected challenges that presented rapidly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic forced students into an unfamiliar learning ecosystem to which they had to quickly adapt in order to continue to be successful in their courses. Literature supports the importance of metacognition and self-regulated learning in the success of students in an online environment. More importantly, the concept of metacognitive regulation, which includes monitoring, planning, executing, and adapting learning strategies, is vital to student academic success. These strategies have been shown to dose the opportunity gap observed specifically in persons excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs) in STEM. Outlined here is the use of student-developed learning plans as a guided process to enhance students' metacognitive regulation of their learning. These learning plans provide students a template to assist them in time management, practical study skills and planned study sessions, that are designed to increase their self-efficacy, motivation, and performance in online classes. Moreover, the iterative nature of the learning plan encourages students to continue to use and expand this plan in other academic courses.

ID IDENTITY
AB STEM outreach experiences provide aspiring scientists and healthcare professionals with opportunities to grow into new roles, integrate knowledge, and acquire soft skills. While STEM outreach publications often describe the outreach performed, few focus on how to establish strong partnerships, which are essential for outreach endeavors to succeed. Information on this is more important than ever before-grant agencies commonly require education and outreach plans that will reach a broader audience. Consequently, principal investigators who are not trained in education or outreach need tools to set up strong partnerships. To help fill this gap, here we outline the recommended steps for developing robust interdisciplinary STEM outreach programs that leverage institutional resources and community partnerships. This process yields strategic and sustainable opportunities for undergraduate students to learn as they engage with the STEM outreach team (students, faculty, university staff, and community partners) and the lay public. The outlined ideas broadly apply to creating outreach programs for trainees at any stage, not just undergraduates.

AB Student self-beliefs regarding intelligence and ability have been shown to correspond to achievement and persistence in an academic domain. Specifically, previous research has suggested that a growth mindsetor the belief that intelligence is malleable and can increase with effort-is associated with student success. Locus of control is a related but distinct self-belief regarding personal agency over various academic and nonacademic outcomes and has also been associated with study skills and academic persistence. However, academic interventions targeting student mindsets and loci of control have remained relatively underexplored, specifically in the context of undergraduate STEM education. Here, we describe the development and assessment of an intervention encouraging students to adopt a growth mindset and internal locus of control. This five- part intervention is administered entirely online and is therefore independent of individual instructor variability. We administered the intervention in five introductory biology courses and show that the intervention was successful in impacting student mindsets and loci of control across various demographics.

TI Development of a New Scoring System To Accurately Estimate Learning
   Outcome Achievements via Single, Best-Answer, Multiple-Choice Questions
   for Preclinical Students in a Medical Microbiology Course
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GUIDELINES; TAXONOMY; BIOLOGY
AB During the preclinical years, single-best-answer multiple-choice questions (SBA-MCQs) are often used to test the higher-order cognitive processes of medical students (such as application and analysis) while simultaneously assessing lower-order processes (like knowledge and comprehension). Consequently, it can be difficult to pinpoint which learning outcome has been achieved or needs improvement. We developed a new scoring system for SBA-MCQs using a step-by-step methodology to evaluate each learning outcome independently. Enrolled in this study were third-year medical students (n = 316) who had registered in the basic microbiology course at the Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University during the academic year 2017. A step-by-step SBA-MCQ with a new scoring system was created and used as a tool to evaluate the validity of the traditional SBA-MCQs that assess two separate outcomes simultaneously. The scores for the two methods, in percentages, were compared using two different questions (SBA-MCQ1 and SBA-MCQ2). SBA-MCQ1 tested the students' knowledge of the causative agent of a specific infectious disease and the basic characteristics of the microorganism, while SBA-MCQ2 tested their knowledge of the causative agent of a specific infectious disease and the pathogenic mechanism of the microorganism. The mean score obtained with the traditional SBA- MCQs was significantly lower than that obtained with the step-by-step SBA-MCQs (85.9% for the traditional approach versus 90.9% for step-by-step SBA-MCQ1; p < 0.001; and 81.5% for the traditional system versus 87.4% for step-by-step SBA-MCQ2; p < 0.001). Moreover, 65.8% and 87.8% of the students scored lower with the traditional SBA-MCQ1 and the traditional SBA-MCQ2, respectively, than with the corresponding sets of step-by-step SBA-MCQ questions. These results suggest that traditional SBA-MCQ scores need to be interpreted with caution because they have the potential to underestimate the learning achievement of students. Therefore, the step-by-step SBA-MCQ is preferable to the traditional SBA-MCQs and is recommended for use in examinations during the preclinical years.

AB Exposure to primary literature using CREATE tools has been shown to have a positive impact on students' self-efficacy and beliefs when incorporated into semester-long courses taught by extensively trained faculty. However, it is unknown whether similar benefits can occur with a brief exposure to CREATE in an otherwise traditionally taught course. We hypothesized that students who experienced a short-term CREATE module taught by faculty with minimal training in this pedagogy would make gains in scientific literacy and self-efficacy while also experiencing epistemological maturation. To test this hypothesis, we compared sections of students who experienced the CREATE module with sections of the same course taught without CREATE. Our hypothesis was partially supported by the data in that students in CREATE sections made significant gains in self-efficacy but did not gain transferable data analysis skills. Students in those sections also self-reported significantly enhanced understanding of the research process. Thus, this study suggests that analysis of primary literature using CREATE, even in short modules, can significantly and positively affect students' self-efficacy and their views of science.

TI Science Communication Training Imparts Confidence and Influences Public

AB The impacts of science are felt across all socio-ecological levels, ranging from the individual to societal. In order to adapt or respond to scientific discoveries, novel technologies, or biomedical or environmental challenges, a fundamental understanding of science is necessary. However, antiscientific rhetoric, mistrust in science, and the dissemination of misinformation hinder the promotion of science as a necessary and beneficial component of our world. Scientists can promote scientific literacy by establishing dialogues with nonexperts, but they may find a lack of formal training as a barrier to public engagement. To address this, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) launched the Art of Science Communication course in 2015 in order to provide scientists at all career stages with introductory science communication training. In 2020, we conducted a retrospective survey of former participants to evaluate how the course had impacted participants' science communication behaviors and their confidence engaging with nonexperts, as well as other benefits to their professional development. We found that scientists were significantly more likely to communicate with nonexpert audiences following the course compared to before (77% versus 51%; P < 0.0001). In addition, quantitative and qualitative data suggested that scientists were more confident in their ability to communicate science after completing the course (median of 8, standard deviation [SD] of 0.98 versus median of 5, SD of 1.57; P < 0.0001). Qualitative responses from participants supported quantitative findings. This suggested that the Art of Science Communication course is highly effective at improving the confidence of scientists to engage with the public and other nonexpert audiences regardless of career status. These data-driven perspectives provide a rationale for the implementation of broadly accessible science communication training programs that promote public engagement with science.

   Active learning has been shown to improve student outcomes across a range of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. In addition, active learning with an interdisciplinary focus in the classroom is beneficial for students to pursue health and allied health careers. Case studies have also been shown to enhance student learning. In this study, we utilized a novel learning approach combining a case study with interdisciplinary focus and an active learning exercise that introduced the chemistry of stains and how this relates to staining various organelles and components in a cell. This case study along with active learning exercise (e.g., a card game, group PowerPoint presentations, or coloring organelles or structures in a eukaryotic cell upon staining with a biochemical stain) resulted in improved student performance as well as long-term retention. This activity can be implemented in introductory biology, microbiology, cell biology, and related STEM disciplines (e.g., chemistry, biochemistry).

AB We used quantitative methods to better understand the perceptions of students in an introductory biology course (Biology 101) at a small, liberal arts college (SLAC) that is also a primarily white institution (PWI). In pre/post surveys, we asked students questions related to their attitudes and beliefs about their professor, classmates, and Biology 101. We were especially interested in the responses and outcomes of underrepresented minorities (URM) and first-generation (FG) students. Our findings suggest URM and FG students have a decreased sense of belonging and increased perceptions of exclusion and differential treatment due to race. These findings can explain, in part, the disparity in Biology 101 grade and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) attrition.

   Experimental Design to Support Reverse Genetic Studies in <i>Arabidopsis

AB Gene-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 have created unprecedented opportunities for genetic studies in plants and animals. We designed a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) to train introductory biology students in the concepts and implementation of gene-editing technology as well as develop their soft skills in data management and scientific communication. We present two versions of the course that can be implemented with twice-weekly meetings over a 5-week period. In the remote-learning version, students performed homology searches, designed guide RNAs (gRNAs) and primers, and learned the principles of molecular cloning. This version is appropriate when access to laboratory equipment or inperson instruction is limited, such as during closures that have occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In person, students designed gRNAs, cloned CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, and performed genetic transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana. Students learned how to design effective gRNA pairs targeting their assigned gene with an 86% success rate. Final exams tested students' ability to apply knowledge of an unfamiliar genome database to characterize gene structure and to properly design gRNAs. Average final exam scores of similar to 73% and similar to 84% for in-person and remote-learning CUREs, respectively, indicated that students met learning outcomes. The highly parallel nature of the CURE makes it possible to target dozens to hundreds of genes, depending on the number of sections. Applying this approach in a sensitized mutant background enables focused reverse genetic screens for genetic suppressors or enhancers. The course can be adapted readily to other organisms or projects that employ gene editing.

AB The demonstrated gap between skills needed and skills learned within a college education places both undergraduates seeking gainful employment and the employers seeking highly skilled workers at a disadvantage. Recent and up-and-coming college graduates should possess 21st century skills (i.e., communication, collaboration, problem solving), skills that employers deem necessary for the workplace. Research shows that the development of this skillset can help narrow the gap in producing highly skilled graduates for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. We propose the development of 21st century skills by utilizing the project-based learning (PjBL) framework and creating the inclusive biologist exploring active research with students (iBEARS) program, allowing undergraduate students to hone their 21st century skills and prepare for transition and success within the workplace.

ID GENE-EXPRESSION
AB Physical distancing and inaccessibility to laboratory facilities created an opportunity to transition undergraduate research experiences to remote, digital platforms, adding another level of pedagogy to their training. Basic bioinformatics skills together with critical analysis of scientific literature are essential for addressing research questions in modern biology. The work presented here describes a fully online, collaborative research experience created to allow undergraduate students to learn those skills. The research experience was focused on the development and implementation of the Organonitrogen Biodegradation Database (ONDB, z.umn.edu/ondb) . The ONDB was developed to catalog information about the cost, chemical properties, and biodegradation potential of commonly used organonitrogen compounds. A crossinstitutional team of undergraduate researchers worked in collaboration with two faculty members and a postdoctoral fellow to develop the database. Students carried out extensive online literature searches and used a biodegradation prediction website to research and represent the microbial catabolism of different organonitrogen compounds. Participants employed computational tools such as R, Shiny, and flexdashboard to construct the database pages and interactive web interface for the ONDB. Worksheets and forms were created to encourage other students and researchers to gather information about organonitrogen compounds and expand the database. Student progress was evaluated through biweekly project meetings, presentations, and a final reflection. The ONDB undergraduate research experience provided a platform for students to learn bioinformatics skills while simultaneously developing a teaching and research tool for others.

AB Creation of an inclusive environment requires a culture of equity, justice, value and respect for diverse backgrounds, and opportunities for students to engage with communities while addressing issues in science and society. These tasks are particularly challenging for institutions lacking a diverse population. Here, we demonstrate evidence of a successful model for creating an inclusive environment in an interinstitutional course between a large, public, historically black institution and a small, private, primarily white institution. Because many individuals from underrepresented minority groups tend to value communal goals of working together and helping their communities, we incorporated two high-impact practices of community-engaged learning and course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) focused on health disparities research in neighboring communities. Although the research projects varied each semester, they were linked by their impact on and engagement with the community. Students practiced cultural competency skills in both small group projects within the class and engagement activities in the community. We measured the efficacy of CURE components (novel authentic research, scientific process skills, iteration, collaboration, and broader impact) through a combination of direct and indirect assessments, quantitative and qualitative analysis. More than simply scientific skills, students from both institutions developed lasting interest in working with diverse populations as well as respecting and valuing different backgrounds. This inclusive environment, combined with increased interest in research, suggests that this course could potentially serve as a model for interinstitutional collaborations in creating inclusive environments that support the future success of diverse students, eventually changing the STEM research culture.

TI Successful Integration of Face-to-Face Bootcamp Lab Courses in a Hybrid
   Online STEM Program
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; SCIENCE
AB The Microbiology and Cell Science program at the University of Florida compressed two standard 16-week lab courses into five-day versions of the course, which are referred to as bootcamp labs. The bootcamp labs have the same objectives, activities, and assessments as their traditional counterparts. Development of the bootcamp labs was part of a larger effort to increase access to the major, and more broadly STEM, by offering a 2+2 hybrid online transfer program. The results of this mixed-methods study include a direct comparison between bootcamp and traditional lab format as an approach for delivery of a face-to-face lab course. The bootcamp lab cohort has a greater diversity of students, with more women and underrepresented minorities in STEM than the traditional semester-long cohorts. Students in the bootcamp labs have comparable grade outcomes and learning gains to students in traditional lab format. Regression analysis identified GPA, but not lab format, as the most significant predictor of success for students enrolled in lab courses. Qualitative results suggest that the bootcamp format may be a better way than traditional formats to teach microbiology lab. In summary, the results demonstrate that a bootcamp version of a face-to-face microbiology course is just as effective as the traditional semester-long version. This work has broader implications as it supports the bootcamp lab approach as a model in STEM education for increasing access and for overcoming a major barrier to online STEM programs: face-to-face delivery of key lab courses.

TI An Experiential-Learning Lesson to Encourage Teamwork and Healthy
   Practices
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TEAMS; PERFORMANCE; CHILDREN; BIOLOGY
AB Many careers require individuals to work together as a team. However, group work or teamwork is often met with resistance in an academic setting, and students can struggle to learn the skills associated with collaboration. I present a lesson that has the overarching goal of helping students practice and learn to make healthy lifestyle choices in the context of experiential learning. Additional learning objectives are to help students understand the physiological processes related to heart disease, practice effective prevention of this medical ailment, and encourage teamwork. Students received a risk score calculated from a randomized combination of hypothetical lifestyle characteristics that affect heart disease risk. Students then spent time outside of class gaining points against their assigned risk score by engaging in specific healthy lifestyle choices outlined on their score sheet. In unannounced pretests and posttests, students showed significant learning gains related to the physiological mechanisms and preventative agents of heart disease. Practicing proper diet, physical activity, and teamwork during adolescence and early adulthood contributes to the integration of these essential healthy habits throughout adulthood. Many students reported that collaboration among the group was a key component in overcoming the challenges associated with completing heart disease prevention actions on their score sheets. The lesson promotes creativity and the building of a support network to lower their risk scores, and it provides them with the opportunity to synthesize information and evaluate their performance in the activity.

DT Article
ID THINKING; BIOLOGY
AB Despite the importance of tree-thinking and evolutionary trees to biology, no appropriately developed concept inventory exists to measure student understanding of these important concepts. To address this need, we developed a multiple-choice concept inventory consisting of 24 pairs of items, and we provide evidence to support its use among undergraduate students. A set of learning outcomes was developed to guide the creation of the concept inventory. The learning outcomes, student interviews, and student responses were used to develop and revise inventory items. Supporting evidence was gathered from traditional item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, traditional reliability analyses, and comparisons to alternative assessments. Appropriate implementation and utility of the concept inventory are discussed.

   To better prepare undergraduate students as informed citizens, they need skills to evaluate and interpret scientific data that are relevant to real world scenarios. Socioscientific issues are typically complicated or debatable issues that require individuals to evaluate their background knowledge and make decisions with respect to social and cultural contexts. Incorporation of socioscientific issues into a course allows students opportunities to demonstrate their argumentation skills. In this study, we investigated the relationship between students' biological content knowledge and their argumentation skills. We evaluated students' content knowledge of primary research articles on mRNA vaccine development and clinical trials. There was no correlation of content knowledge and students' argumentation skills to counter vaccine hesitancy. While most students demonstrated understanding of the primary research articles, almost half the students did not include specific biological knowledge in their arguments, indicating they had difficulty in applying their knowledge to the real world. These results suggest there is a need to provide students with additional opportunities to practice and develop their argumentation skills with respect to socioscientific issues.

ID STIMULATED RECALL
AB Instructor discourse, defined as verbal interactions with students in the classroom, can play an important role in student learning. Instructors who use dialogic discourse invite students to develop their own ideas, and both students and the instructor share ideas in back-and-forth exchanges.
   Instructor discourse, defined as verbal interactions with students in the classroom, can play an important role in student learning. Instructors who use dialogic discourse invite students to develop their own ideas, and both students and the instructor share ideas in back-and-forth exchanges. This type of discourse is well-suited to facilitate deep learning for students but is rare in undergraduate biology classrooms. Understanding the reasoning that underlies the use of dialogic discourse can inform teaching professional development for instructors who are learning to use discourse to support student learning. Through classroom video recordings to identify dialogic discourse and stimulated recall interviews to elicit instructor reasoning, we investigated why undergraduate biology instructors used dialogic discourse in active-learning lessons. Using inductive and deductive qualitative analysis of interview transcripts, we identified and characterized seven reasons that instructors used dialogic discourse, including three aligned with a theoretical framework of student cognitive engagement and four that emerged from our data set. In addition to aiming to prompt generative cognitive engagement in 34% of instances of dialogic discourse, instructors used dialogic discourse to prompt activity, supply information, provide feedback, decipher student thinking, leverage student thinking, and cue students to make connections. Reasoning varied across different types of dialogic discourse. These findings provide valuable insights that can inform research, teaching professional development, and individual instructors' reflections.

   Social media has the power to spread information faster than any other news source. The science community has experienced this firsthand during recent years, unfortunately to its detriment. When scientific and medical claims are made without responsible examination of scientific evidence, misinformation is allowed to spread. While all users are likely faced with misleading claims on social media, this is especially troublesome for young adults. As the most prevalent users, many in this age group have never known a time without social media. Educators have an opportunity to use social media as a real-world application to teach students how to critically analyze scientific and medical information. The Social Media Reflection Assignment (SMRA) was created to help students develop such scientific literacy skills. This intervention requires students to find social media posts that make scientific claims, citing published scientific data. Students locate the corresponding research article and describe the results in their own words. Finally, a comparison is drawn between scientific findings in the research article and the interpretation described in the social media post. Students are taught to judge whether social media claims are supported by the scientific evidence. This activity is adaptable and applicable in a variety of classroom settings, from upper-level majors courses to science courses for nonmajors to disciplines outside the sciences. Importantly, the SMRA helps students question claims in social media while training them to find and elucidate answers from reliable resources.

AB As the amount and complexity of scientific knowledge continues to grow, it is essential to educate scientifically literate citizens who can comprehend the process of science and the implications of technological advances. This is especially important when educating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college students, since they may play a central role in the future of scientific research and its communication.
   As the amount and complexity of scientific knowledge continues to grow, it is essential to educate scientifically literate citizens who can comprehend the process of science and the implications of technological advances. This is especially important when educating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college students, since they may play a central role in the future of scientific research and its communication. A central part of decoding and interpreting scientific information is the ability to analyze scientific research articles. For this reason, many different approaches for reading scientific research articles have been developed and published. Despite the availability of numerous ways of analyzing scientific research articles, biology students can face challenges that may prevent them from fully comprehending the text. We sought to address student challenges with science vocabulary and content knowledge by adding structural supports to in-classroom article discussions through the use of annotated articles from the Science in the Classroom initiative. We describe the pedagogical approach used for discussing scientific research articles within a required biology course. In this context, we found that students' scientific literacy skills increased at the end of the semester. We also found that, for each article discussed, the majority of students could interpret graphical representations of article results and that they could identify and comprehend components of the experimental design of the study.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The sudden shift to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic left many instructors wondering how to minimize anxiety while keeping students engaged in their virtual courses. In this study, we explored (i) specific online instructional tasks that caused students to experience anxiety, (ii) factors that hindered student engagement with online instruction, and (iii) changes in student anxiety and engagement between spring 2020 and fall 2020. Students enrolled in STEM classes were surveyed at the end of spring 2020 (N = 425) and fall 2020 (N = 347) semesters. Our results show that the majority of student respondents had more anxiety in fall 2020 than in spring 2020 with online learning in general, and less anonymous class activities tended to cause the greatest anxiety. Distractions from the environment and personal technologies commonly prevented engagement in both semesters, but no significant differences were observed between the spring and fall. In contrast, more students reported that health-related stress, work-related stress, and issues with technology prevented participation in fall 2020 than in spring 2020. As institutions consider expanding their online course offerings post-pandemic, these data provide valuable insight into the challenges students experienced with online instruction that can inform future pedagogical choices.

AB Student incivility, defined as a student behavior perceived to be disrespectful or disruptive to the overall learning environment in a course, can negatively affect the science learning environment and instructors. The transition to online science courses during the COVID-19 pandemic created a unique environment for student incivility to take place in undergraduate courses. There are few studies that examine student incivility in online synchronous courses, and we know of no studies that have investigated student incivility during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we surveyed 283 instructors across U.S. institutions who taught undergraduate science courses with synchronous online components. We probed their experiences with student incivility during the fall 2020 term. Over half of instructors surveyed reported experiencing student incivility, with women being more likely than men to report student incivility. Compared with white instructors, people of color were more likely to perceive an increase in student incivility in fall 2020 relative to previous in-person terms. This work indicates that student incivility is perceived in the online synchronous learning environment and that the negative impacts of perceived student incivility during COVID-19 online instruction were not distributed equally among instructors, disproportionately burdening women and people of color.

AB Calls for early exposure of all undergraduates to research have led to the increased use and study of course-based research experiences (CREs). CREs have been shown to increase measures of persistence in the sciences, such as science identity, scientific self-efficacy, project ownership, scientific community values, and networking. However, implementing CREs can be challenging and resource-intensive. These barriers may be partly mitigated by the use of short-term CRE modules rather than semester- or year-long projects. One study has shown that a CRE module captures some of the known benefits of CREs as measured by the Persistence in the Sciences (PITS) survey. Here, we used this same survey to assess outcomes for introductory biology students who completed a semester of modular CREs based on faculty research at an RI university. The results indicated levels of self-efficacy, science community values, and science identity similar to those previously reported for students in the Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) full-semester CRE. Scores for project ownership (content) were between previously reported traditional lab and CRE scores, while project ownership (emotion) and networking were similar to those of traditional labs. Our results suggest that modular CREs can lead to significant gains in student affect measures that have been linked to persistence in the sciences in other studies. Although gains were not as great in all measures as with a semester-long CRE, implementation of modular CREs may be more feasible and offers the added benefits of exposing students to diverse research fields and lab techniques.

TI Disparities in Remote Learning Faced by First-Generation and
   Underrepresented Minority Students during COVID-19: Insights and
   Opportunities from a Remote Research Experience

AB The COVID-19 pandemic forced an unprecedented shift to remote instruction across higher education, reducing access to critically important undergraduate research experience and potentially magnifying inequities faced by first-generation and underrepresented minority (URM) students in higher education. Through a novel course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) at UCLA, delivered completely online, results of a unique, student-generated survey showed that the transition to remote learning was challenging for all students, increasing student workload, decreasing ability to focus on school, and limiting their ability to succeed. However, results showed significant disparities in remote learning that disproportionately impacted URM and first-generation students. These students had significantly greater expectations to help siblings with remote learning,; URM and first-generation students also suffered greater economic and food insecurity related to COVID-19. At the same time, this study demonstrates how student voices in survey development provide novel and actionable insights. While access to CUREs is often limited by laboratory space, by focusing on the research process, rather than specific laboratory skills, this study provides a scalable pedagogical model for remote undergraduate research experiences. Importantly, this model fostered student engagement and increased interest in further undergraduate research, including topics not directly related to the subject of this study, suggesting that online CUREs can be effective and impactful.

TI Engaging Undergraduates in Research Experiences at a Distance: Insights
   and Recommendations for Remote UREs
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Undergraduates phenotyping Arabidopsis knockouts (unPAK) is a biology research network that has provided undergraduate research experiences (URE) since 2010. In 2019, unPAK expanded to include a summer URE that engaged undergraduate researchers from across the network in an intensive collaborative program. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, unPAK rapidly shifted to provide the summer URE program remotely. This article describes (i) the instructional and communication processes of unPAK in the remote URE; and (ii) a summative assessment of the outcomes associated with the remote summer program compared with the 2019 in-person program. We conclude by offering timely recommendations for educators in biology that emerged from the 2020 remote summer research experience, which may be applicable to other remote UREs and course-based research experiences (CUREs).

AB Recent times of excessive stress call for a reflection and reformation of how people interact and support one another. This is particularly true in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline-based education, where it is becoming increasingly important for course instructors to adopt student-centered teaching approaches that engage students, maintain rigor, and consider the students' learning experiences, including stress. What are some pedagogical strategies that instructors can draw upon to help students cope with trauma and regain a healthy state of learning in an already-challenging field? To prepare instructors for the transition to remote instruction, a variety of evidence-based pedagogical and technological approaches were designed to promote resilient student-centered classrooms and facilitate student development and care in times of crisis. This perspective provides an overview of the salient research behind these strategies, highlights those that instructors found most useful, and concludes with planned next steps in the continued effort to support instructors.

AB Children are aware of microbes from a young age and are rightly encouraged to wash their hands to prevent illness. However, myriad microbes live in, on, and around us, most of which are benign or beneficial. Our goal was to teach elementary students about microbiota by leveraging familiar literacy practices, social studies themes, and the arts to advance students' knowledge and reasoning skills in science. With this perspective in mind, we developed and implemented an interdisciplinary unit targeted at second grade, in which students learned about microbes and microbial communities. Our goal was to further students' conceptual knowledge of the microbes that surround them by purposefully integrating microbial communities within the second grade curriculum. Throughout the unit, students engaged in hands-on, inquiry-based science experiences and used multimodal communication (through a combination of linguistic, visual, audio, gestural, and spatial modes): they sampled microbes from their own bodies and/or environments and applied their knowledge and imagination to create their own microbes through art and story-telling, generating a class microbial community-both literal and artistic. At the end of the unit, students demonstrated knowledge of microbes and of the diversity and ubiquity of microbial communities and habitats.

AB Day 1: Watershed (WS) is a first-year program designed to provide an inclusive environment for students and immerse them in research from day 1 of college. Originally developed to support students from underrepresented groups (URGs) including first-generation students and students of color, WS provides authentic research experiences for all students as they collect and analyze water and microbiological samples from the local watershed. WS also includes a living- learning community with students living in the same dorm and taking common courses during their first year. In the first year of our study, researchers investigated students' anxieties, feelings of belonging or isolation, supports received, and personal habits. In year 2 (the primary year reported), researchers used mixed-methods and self-determination theory to determine how WS students differed from students in other introductory and research-based courses in terms of basic psychological needs satisfaction (including autonomy, competence, and relatedness). Results indicated that although WS students felt less autonomous and, at times, less competent than other students, 90% reported a positive experience. Furthermore, findings suggest that WS students' feelings of connection with classmates and instructors, as well as a sense of belonging in the course, provided the necessary motivational support to facilitate a positive learning experience. These findings indicate that the WS program can be a viable model for supporting students in early science courses and making them feel included.

TI Suggestions for Improving Invited Speaker Diversity To Reflect Trainee

AB Within the field of biomedical research in the United States, the proportion of underrepresented minorities at the Full Professor level has remained consistently low, even though trainee demographics are becoming more diverse. Underrepresented groups face a complex set of barriers to achieving faculty status, including imposter syndrome, increased performance expectations, and patterns of exclusion. Institutionalized racism and sexism have contributed to these barriers and perpetuated policy that excludes underrepresented minorities. These barriers can contribute to decreased feelings of belonging, which may result in decreased retention of underrepresented minorities. Though some universities have altered their hiring practices to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the applicant pool, these changes have not been sufficient. Here we argue that departmental invited seminar series can be used to provide trainees with scientific role models and increase their sense of belonging while institutions work towards more inclusive policy. In this study, we investigated the demographics (gender and race) of invited seminar speakers over 5 years to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan. We also investigated current trainee demographics and compared them to invited speaker demographics to gauge if our trainees were being provided with representation of themselves. We found that invited speaker demographics were skewed towards Caucasian men, and our trainee demographics were not being represented. From these findings, we proposed policy change within the department to address how speakers are being invited with the goal of increasing speaker diversity to better reflect trainee diversity. To facilitate this process, we developed a set of suggestions and a web-based resource that allows scientists, committees, and moderators to identify members of underserved groups. These resources can be easily adapted by other fields or subfields to promote inclusion and diversity at seminar series, conferences, and colloquia.

TI A "Choose-Your-Own" Classroom-Based Activity That Promotes Scientific
   Inquiry about RNA Interference
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GENE
AB RNA interference (RNAi), the process that results in the degradation of a target gene's mRNA, is a fundamental part of eukaryotic gene regulation and is also an important molecular technique that allows for experimental manipulation of gene expression without altering DNA sequences. Despite the importance of RNAi, there have been relatively few lecture-based activities designed to teach about the consequences of this process and counter common misconceptions. I present here an inquiry-based activity that is centered around a "choose your own experiment" design where students generate hypotheses and critically evaluate their ideas by choosing several simulated experiments. The activity presents students with one of the original puzzling observations, the discovery that triggering overexpression of a given gene in a flower resulted in an opposite change in phenotype than expected, and the subsequent discovery that there was a dramatic decrease of that gene's mRNA, that sparked the discovery of RNAi. Students then propose a molecular mechanism for these results before using a limited budget of funding to simulate their choice of experiments. Simulated results are provided for these experiments, and students must work together to interpret and discuss these results before deciding on the next experiment. I provide a guide for instructors on how to implement this activity, with suggestions on how to vary the activity to fit different class sizes as well as an abbreviated version for instructors who are short on time. Finally, I include an aligned assessment so that instructors may check student learning about the impacts of RNAi.

TI Just Figures: A Method to Introduce Students to Data Analysis One Figure
   at a Time
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID READ
AB Quantitative data analysis skills are basic competencies students in a STEM field should master. In this article, we describe a classroom activity using isolated figures from papers as a simple exercise to practice data analysis skills. We call this approach Just Figures. With this technique, instructors find figures from primary papers that address key concepts related to several of their course learning objectives. These figures are assigned as homework prior to class discussion. In class, instructors teach the lesson and include a 10- to 20-minute discussion of the figures assigned. Frequent and repeated discussion of paper figures during class increased students' confidence in reading and analyzing data. The Just Figures approach also increased student accuracy when interpreting data. After six weeks of Just Figures practice, students scored, on average, three points higher on a 20-point data analysis assessment instrument than they had done before the Just Figures exercises. In addition, a course in which students consistently practiced Just Figures performed just as well on the data analysis assessment instrument and on a class exam dedicated to paper reading compared with courses where students practiced reading three entire papers. The Just Figures method is easy to implement and can effectively improve student data analysis skills in microbiology classrooms.

ID SURVEILLANCE
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a high level of scientific illiteracy and mistrust that pervades the scientific and medical communities. This finding has proven the necessity of updating current methods used to expose undergraduates to research. The research in traditional course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) is limited by undergraduate time constraints, skill level, and course structure, and consequently it does not attain the learning objectives or the high-impact, relevant studies achieved in graduate-level laboratories using a cyclic trainee/trainer model. Although undergraduate independent study (ISY) research more closely matches the structure and learning objectives of graduate-level research, they are uncommon as professors and universities typically view them as a significant time and resource burden with limited return. Cyclic independent study-assisted CUREs (CIS-CUREs) combine many positive aspects of ISY graduate-level research, and CUREs by pre-training ISY research lead to facilitate CURE proposal and project semesters in a cyclic model. The CIS-CURE approach allowed undergraduate students at Stetson University to perform and disseminate more rigorous, involved, long-term, and challenging research projects, such as the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. In doing so, all students would have the opportunity to participate in a high-impact research project and consequently gain a more comprehensive training, reach higher levels of research dissemination, and increase their competitiveness after graduating. Together, CIS-CUREs generate graduates with higher scientific literacy and thus combat scientific mistrust in communities.

AB Previous research has shown that the use of clickers in the classroom enhances student engagement. However, few studies have investigated how the type of clicker question may influence learning outcomes. To explore this, we compared the effects of lower-order cognitive skill (LOCS) and higher-order cognitive skill (HOCS) clicker questions on later exam performance in a biology course. During class time, students were presented with clicker questions directly related to unit content. Half of the content units were taught with LOCS, the other half with HOCS. To ensure that type of content did not influence results, the cognitive level of the clicker questions was counterbalanced across two semesters. The exams included a mix of LOCS and HOCS for each content unit. We also investigated the possible moderating effects of student perceptions on the relationship between type of clicker question and exam performance using student surveys. We found that using HOCS clicker questions significantly affects student learning. Practice with HOCS clicker questions improved performance on LOCS exam questions but not on HOCS exam questions. Students ranked lecture with clickers as a preferred and most helpful teaching methodology. Overall, these results suggest that practice with HOCS questions is engaging and gives students practice recalling content to "solve" a problem, thereby encoding low-level information and preparing them for higher-order thinking activities.

AB Training in career preparation is vital for biomedical science, microbiology, and related life science undergraduates to know the types of careers available in the field, to obtain employment after graduation, and to be successful in these careers. This is especially critical for historically marginalized students who have lower science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) retention and lower STEM employment rates.
   Training in career preparation is vital for biomedical science, microbiology, and related life science undergraduates to know the types of careers available in the field, to obtain employment after graduation, and to be successful in these careers. This is especially critical for historically marginalized students who have lower science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) retention and lower STEM employment rates. Thus, we developed a career preparation course aimed for second- and third-year students in biomedical science, microbiology, biology, and related majors. This course introduced students to diverse careers via guest speakers and provided training and practice in key career skills, like writing CVs and cover letters. In this curriculum article, we present our course curriculum and resources, evidence of student achievement of learning objectives, and evidence that this course supported growth in constructs like science networking and confidence in future self, which are known to support student STEM retention and success.

TI Reconnecting Students and Faculty to Maximize Academic Integrity and
   Minimize Student Stress in the Virtual Classroom
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE academic integrity; exams; stress; virtual classroom; cheating
AB The article documents faculty experiences with the shift online due to the pandemic and provides recommendations to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructors. Over 100 faculty members were surveyed on these topics and contrasted with previously reported student experiences. The online shift changed how faculty administered exams, ran courses, and acted to ensure academic integrity. For example, when exams went online, 73% of faculty reported spending more time preventing cheating. Concerning academic integrity and stress, faculty and students agreed with the exception of a few notable disconnects. Students reported greater workloads in online classes, while faculty maintained that the shift online did not change student workloads. Students perceived more online cheating than faculty. Overall, there seems to be a significant disconnect regarding faculty not realizing how much their actions may encourage or discourage cheating. Few faculty (<15%) indicated that being a tough grader or having test times too short is a motivating factor, but over 55% of students reported that these motivate students to cheat. Conversely, over 60% of students reported respect for their professors discourages them from cheating, while only 37% of faculty indicated the same. Over 70% of faculty and students indicated that fear of getting caught is a deterrent to cheating. Recommendations to reconnect include (i) faculty should use the finding that the number one deterrent of cheating is fear of getting caught; and (ii) faculty should maintain students' respect by being clear or overestimating workload requirements, carefully adjusting time for online exams, and setting clear expectations with uncomplicated exam questions consistent with the material taught.

   inclusion; undergraduate belonging

AB Connections between students and faculty on campus may influence students' sense of belonging, and a greater sense of belonging has a positive effect on student success. We developed a low-cost, faculty-led program of community-building events and implemented the program in the biology department at a small liberal-arts institution with the goal of improving students' sense of community. Student responses to surveys indicated that the majority of students felt connected to faculty and students in the department; however, Black or African American students initially felt a lower level of connection to faculty than did white students. After implementing our series of community-building events, students surveyed reported high levels of satisfaction with the events. Furthermore, there was a trend toward a higher percentage of Black or African American students than white students reporting that they were more likely to reach out to faculty after participating in the community-building events. Thus, our low-cost program improved connections between students and faculty in the biology department. Collectively, our results suggest that academic departments can implement community-building programs to improve students' sense of belonging.

TI Student Attitudes Contribute to the Effectiveness of a Genomics CURE

AB The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP) engages students in a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE). To better understand the student attributes that support success in this CURE, we asked students about their attitudes using previously published scales that measure epistemic beliefs about work and science, interest in science, and grit. We found, in general, that the attitudes students bring with them into the classroom contribute to two outcome measures, namely, learning as assessed by a pre- and postquiz and perceived self-reported benefits. While the GEP CURE produces positive outcomes overall, the students with more positive attitudes toward science, particularly with respect to epistemic beliefs, showed greater gains. The findings indicate the importance of a student's epistemic beliefs to achieving positive learning outcomes.

AB Effectively reading and interpreting scientific literature are fundamental skills for students pursuing degrees in STEM fields. In-person classes allow for real-time discussion and dissection of scientific literature; however, with increasing focus on virtual learning environments, alternative approaches are needed to promote student development of these skills. This manuscript presents suggestions for conducting paper discussions in asynchronous environments via learning management system (LMS) message boards. Modifications of this paper discussion activity for different class sizes, educational levels, and assignment goals are included.

TI Exploring Instagram to Promote Student Engagement in an Online Didactic

ID SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES; FACEBOOK; RETENTION; ENHANCE; MEDIA
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has forced higher education institutions to shift to nearly 100% online delivery of didactic coursework nationally. Beside the stress and isolation that many students experience simply due to the physical distancing requirements imposed by the crisis, students new to learning in an online environment may feel further isolated and disengaged from the course content. Consequently, we explored the use of an existing online social networking tool, Instagram, to enhance students' engagement with online course material. In this study, students enrolled in both undergraduate and graduate online science courses were invited to participate. Course instructors posted materials related to the topics covered in the course weekly sessions, including links to news reports, cartoons, and short quizzes. At the conclusion of each course, a questionnaire focusing on the students' experience was distributed to all participants. Results from the survey showed that the weekly Instagram posts allowed students to feel more engaged with the course content and connected with the course instructors and classmates. However, some students reported that the posts were not helpful or that they did not feel comfortable using social networking tools for education purposes due to privacy concerns. In this article, we provide tips for how to improve the effectiveness of using social networking tools to augment didactic online courses.

DT Article; Publication with Expression of Concern
AB Identification of unknown bacteria is an integral module in most introductory Microbiology laboratory courses. This laboratory activity typically involves identifying bacteria based on Gram staining for morphology and gram reaction followed by studying their biochemical characteristics. When instruction moved to online mode earlier this year due to the pandemic, we faced the challenge of moving this handson, skill-intensive laboratory activity to remote mode. Here we describe the modular approach we designed to implement the midterm practical of bacterial identification remotely while trying to keep the online format as close to the in-person format as possible in a multi-section synchronous laboratory course. This virtual module was implemented successfully in the summer and fall 2020 semesters.

AB Because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, higher education institutions had to pivot rapidly to online remote learning. Many educators were concerned that the disparate impact of this crisis would exacerbate inequities in learning outcomes and student learning experiences, especially for students from minoritized backgrounds. We examined course grades and student perceptions of their learning experiences in fall (face-to-face) and spring (fully remote) quarters in an introductory biology course series at a public research university. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that student course grades increased overall during remote learning, and equity gaps in course grades were mitigated for minoritized students. We hypothesize that instructors may have changed their grading practices to compensate for challenges in remote learning in crisis. However, spring students reported significant decreases in the amount of peer negotiation and social support, critical components of active learning. These findings suggest that remote teaching in crisis may have negatively affected student learning environments in ways that may not have been captured by grading practices.

TI Ready, Cell, Go! Guided Movement Exercises in an Introductory Cell
   Biology Course
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Cells and dance are each dynamic manifestations of energy, shape, time, and space. Here we present a novel application of movement learning in cell biology education. "Ready, Cell, Go!" is a set of movement exercises for introductory cell biology students designed to teach concepts of fluidity, crowding, and chaos. These aspects of cells are difficult to glean from two-dimensional illustrations in textbooks or animations where necessary simplification abstracts processes from their full cellular context. Forty-four undergraduate biology students were guided to move using three sets of cues in a dance studio setting where each exercise aimed to experientially highlight and deepen understanding of a different aspect of cellular structure and function. Students described their experiences and personal learning outcomes in written reflections. The movement-based exercises we describe provided a means of discovery, inquiry, and interest for introductory cell biology students and serve as a template to teach other central concepts in cell biology.

TI A One-Year Introductory Biology Majors' Lab Sequence Incorporating
   <i>Vision</i> & <i>Change</i>
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The introduction of Vision and Change by AAAS and the recommendation that biology departments amend their curricula to focus on key concepts and skills necessary for graduates have led to a re-envisioning of introductory curricula across the nation. Many of the "standard" biology text books have realigned their focus with Vision and Change, while new texts have emerged that completely revise how we teach introductory biology majors. One such textbook is Integrating Concepts in Biology (ICB), by Campbell, Heyer, and Paradise. Many departments, including ours, have adopted this text as a novel way to teach biology majors, focusing on active learning, the scientific method, and specifically, understanding data. However, with all of these revisions to biology textbooks, there have been no revisions or insights into corresponding labs for a typical I-year introductory course sequence. Here, we provide a description of our I-year lab sequence, emphasizing the scientific method and novel research, with a focus on the five "Big Ideas" presented in ICB. By removing the "cookbook" labs typical of most introductory laboratory courses, we found that this system better emphasized the focus of Vision and Change and, concomitantly, student appeared to enjoy the lab sequence and see the relevance to class material better, compared to previous years. We believe that this lab organization is a simple design that is not resource-intensive and can be utilized at schools of any size or budget.

AB College to Career is a phrase that we often use to describe the skills and abilities that students should achieve while preparing for college and/or careers. To help prepare our students for their future careers, we developed a microbiology laboratory curriculum based on factors identified to improve college-to-career readiness. These factors include content knowledge, analyzing and interpreting data, accountability, goal setting, and teamwork. At the core of the design are inquiry and problem-based learning. This approach allows students to actively engage in the scientific process while collaborating with classmates and learning technical and transferable career skills. The curriculum includes microbiology laboratory skills, including plating, serial dilutions, and biochemical tests, with integrated opportunities for students to engage in critical thinking, analysis and interpretation of data, teamwork, goal setting, decision-making, and scientific writing.

AB Learning to read primary scientific literature (PSL) is an important part of developing scientific literacy skills. First-year students entering college often have little previous exposure to PSL and therefore face initial barriers in learning how to engage with PSL.
   Learning to read primary scientific literature (PSL) is an important part of developing scientific literacy skills. First-year students entering college often have little previous exposure to PSL and therefore face initial barriers in learning how to engage with PSL. Annotations have been shown to be a useful tool in undergraduate education and have potential for guiding students in developing higher-level reading strategies. In this study, we collected both qualitative and quantitative data to test the hypothesis of whether annotated PSL aids in the development of reading strategies for novice students learning to read PSL. Our qualitative results showed that annotations help students (i) break down PSL into manageable pieces, (ii) summarize the text, (iii) identify key information, and (iv) distinguish between different sections of PSL. Quantitatively, we saw no significant influence of annotations on the development of reading strategies for students learning to read PSL. Overall, our study provides a window into better understanding of specific strategies that students employ in reading PSL. Collectively, we suggest incorporating annotated PSL with some scaffolding social activities as an effective strategy to bring novice readers up the on-ramp of scientific literacy.

AB With rapid advances in science and technology, individuals are faced with the challenging process of making decisions based on sound and accurate information. As a result, to promote scientific literacy, scientists must be able to engage with a wide range of audiences in an inclusive and engaging manner. In addition to a solid knowledge of facts and data, effective scientific communication requires an empathetic approach that comes from a place of understanding and values the knowledge and experience of the intended audience. Here, we present two modules designed to introduce undergraduate students to fundamental concepts in empathetic science communication and provide an opportunity for students to develop a personalized methodology. Over the course of two 75-min classes, students engaged in the process of character development and role play in support of discussions around vaccine hesitancy or community-based service learning. Based on student feedback, the module was well received and supported student growth as engaged scientists and citizens.

AB Engaging undergraduate biology majors may present challenges for educators disseminating science concepts utilizing standard lecture classroom formats. Moreover, animal behavior courses teaching ethology may often require the use of live animals, field excursions, or students having to develop projects which can be both time-consuming or require financial investment, or that may not be well-suited to the flexibility of being taught online.
   Engaging undergraduate biology majors may present challenges for educators disseminating science concepts utilizing standard lecture classroom formats. Moreover, animal behavior courses teaching ethology may often require the use of live animals, field excursions, or students having to develop projects which can be both time-consuming or require financial investment, or that may not be well-suited to the flexibility of being taught online. Therefore, developing in-class activities which allow students to use self-discovery when generating their own observational data, work in groups, and practice hands-on science may serve to ameliorate these challenges facing faculty teaching animal behavior course content. To this end, I developed a straightforward, engaging in-class activity which allowed students to scan images available on the smartphone identifier iNaturalist to generate their own ethograms (catalogs of behaviors) for local state species. Students successfully described behaviors across a variety of animal taxa, reptiles, mammals, birds, and insects when generating their own ethograms and data, and they actively discussed how this activity enabled them to further understand both ethograms and their importance to animal behavior and overall how animals behave and allocate time performing a variety of behaviors. This activity can be modified for further use in both introductory and upper-level course work in organismal biology and can incorporate data analysis, graphing, or presentation skill sets for science majors.

TI Implementing CURES with Cookbook-Style Laboratory Exercises in
   in-Person, Online, and Hybrid Formats
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide students with ample opportunity to engage in the scientific process and are increasingly replacing more traditional cookbook-style laboratory exercises in the undergraduate biology curriculum. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the difficulty of implementing these projects during times of crisis. The quick transition to online learning during the pandemic afforded us a unique opportunity to develop an alternative version of our CURE for the online environment and to compare the efficacy of our CURE on learning gains in online versus in-person learning situations. Compared with a previous semester, our data suggest no significant differences in learning gains between students who participated in a hands-on CURE and an online CURE. Taken together this data suggests an avenue for CURE implementation even while teaching in online or hybrid formats. We discuss strategies that made the CURE successful in the online format and offer suggestions for how to adapt such activities for online or hybrid courses.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic radically and without warning changed the laboratory learning environment for students and instructors. Students were faced with having to be receptive to new learning methods; instructors scrambled to devise innovative ways of providing a realistic lab experience for students. The demand for creative online teaching strategies and the expansion of gamified training platforms created an opportunity for the development of new and interactive lab experiences. Current online labs offer some elements of a "real" lab experience, but a system that incorporates all the tools needed to create a realistic, immersive lab environment has yet to be developed. This study examines using different gamification elements implemented in a PowerPoint-based platform. There was no cost associated with the virtual lab and it could be easily downloaded, increasing accessibility. In true gaming style, a student could "play" without restriction, without the limitations that accompany wet labs. Students were challenged with various scenarios throughout the lab, making choices and receiving feedback through the process. These features positively impacted student outcomes and improved engagement, as expressed in end-of-course evaluations. The implementation also stressed the need for further development of embedded assessments, competitive and interactive opportunities for students, and access to detailed learning analytics for instructors.

TI Who Let the Dogs Out? A Plea for Official Guidelines on Service Animals
   in the Teaching Laboratory
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Microbiology teaching labs provide the opportunity for students to develop marketable skills while observing the microbial inhabitants of our planet as they grow, ferment, and produce colorful by-products. Emphasizing safe laboratory practices is an essential part of this education, but occasionally situations that challenge safety paradigms arise. We describe here a recent incident in which a student brought a guide dog-in-training to her microbiology lab, causing a scramble to provide "reasonable" accommodations. Following time-consuming consultations with Disability Services for Students, Human Resources, Risk Management, and Legal Counsel, it was determined that the student had no disability herself and was not actually a certified guide-dog trainer. This deceptive behavior is not acceptable in general but is especially dangerous in a microbiology lab where safe lab practices are essential. Ultimately it was agreed that the microbiology lab is not a public space but rather a restricted space that requires closed toed shoes and personal protective equipment. Thus it is not possible to admit animals that are not fully trained, as this can endanger both the animal and the other students in the laboratory. The intent is not to limit opportunities for the truly disabled but rather to keep every student safe. Our objective is to bring attention to this complex issue in hopes that the American Society for Microbiology or other prominent scientific organizations will establish clear guidelines to educate students, faculty, administrators, and the general public on the challenges and dangers associated with guide dogs in a microbiology laboratory.

TI "Researcher for a Day": Creating and Shaping a New Generation of

DT Article
AB Science is the engine of prosperity, helping society respond to the important issues it faces. We are presently witnessing a worldwide decline in high school students' interest in science, regardless of gender. To overcome this problem, developing science promotion programs and activities that inspire young people to become the scientists of tomorrow is critical. We strongly believe in the leadership of research centers in creating such programs, which could have a significant impact on the next generation of scientists. Here we present the "Researcher for a Day" program, which offers senior high school students immersion days in a scientific workplace dedicated to microbiology, as an example for other institutions that would like to implement such a program. Researcher for a Day has already helped more than 4,000 young students who are considering their career choices discover the world of science. Similar approaches could be implemented virtually anywhere to extend these efforts to promote science among young people.

TI Time-Restricted Inquiry-Based Learning Promotes Active Student
   Engagement in Undergraduate Zoology Laboratory
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOLOGY
AB Organizing a zoology laboratory for an undergraduate course is often a challenge, particularly in a limited-resource setting, due to the vast variety of topics to cover and the limited numbers of preserved specimens and permanent slides. In zoology, the class structure generally takes the form of a lecture demonstration followed by sample exhibition stations. This setting often fails to actively engage the majority of students in exploring the specimens. Here we propose an alternative organization of a zoology class lab format comprised of short guided-inquiry, time-restricted lab stations, and a freely structured follow-up project intended to increase attention and conceptual understanding of the lab topic. The lab is designed in two parts: a 10-minute in-class rotation portion, where small groups of students take turns investigating specimens following an instructor demonstration, and an after-class group assignment. We implemented the strategy for two years, and it is clear that our approach significantly increased student's active engagement in the class. The time-restricted scheme ensures all students participate despite limited resources, while the guided instructions keep the students focused on the topic. Furthermore, the team assignment portion, in particular the media creation aspect, promoted teamwork among group members.

TI Integrating CRISPR-Cas9 Technology into Undergraduate Courses:
   Perspectives from a National Science Foundation (NSF) Workshop for
   Undergraduate Faculty, June 2018
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB As CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 technology becomes more mainstream in life science research, it becomes critical for undergraduate instructors to devise engaging ways to bring the technology into their classrooms. To help meet this challenge, the National Science Foundation sponsored a workshop for undergraduate instructors in June 2018 at The Ohio State University in conjunction with the annual Association of Biology Laboratory Educators meeting based on a workflow developed by the workshop's facilitators. Over the course of two and a half days, participants worked through a modular workflow for the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in a course-based (undergraduate) research experience (CURE) setting while discussing the barriers each of their institutions had to implementing such work, and how such barriers could be overcome. The result of the workshop was a team with newfound energy and confidence to implement CRISPR-Cas9 technology in their courses and the development of a community of undergraduate educators dedicated to supporting each other in the implementation of the workflow either in a CURE or modular format. In this article, we review the activities and discussions from the workshop that helped each participant devise their own tailored approaches of how best to bring this exciting new technology into their classes.

TI Application of the Microbiology Concept Inventory to improve

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE concept inventories; bias detection; programmatic curricular reform;
   microbiology
AB The Microbiology Concept Inventory is an assessment tool derived from the fundamental statements created by the American Society for Microbiology. This two-tier, multiple-choice question inventory requires students to choose the most correct answer for each question and provide a brief justification of their reasoning. Educators can utilize this tool to identify common misconceptions held by students and adjust curriculum to address and prevent the persistence of student misconceptions. Over the course of 5 years, the Microbiology Concept Inventory was annually administered to undergraduate students enrolled in entry-level, mid-level, and senior capstone microbiology courses at a mid-western rural university. Analysis was completed to compare course, year, majors and minors, gender, ethnicity, and cumulative GPA. Results of this study showed a significant difference in Microbiology Concept Inventory scores between students with high cumulative GPAs (3.5-4.0) and students with comparatively lower cumulative GPAs (2.5-2.99, 3.0-3.49). Results between the other demographic categories revealed statistically different scores in favor of white students, but no differences in scores between genders. The results suggest evidence of ethnic bias, but no gender bias as measured by the Microbiology Concept Inventory. Additionally, significant differences in scores across cohorts are indicative of improvements in the curricula due to prior targeted changes. Analysis of concept inventory results can guide curriculum changes for course instructors. Implementation of curriculum changes can enrich students' academic success.

ID CONSTRUCTION
AB Recombinant plasmids are essential tools in molecular biotechnology, and reliable plasmid assembly methods have, therefore, become a prerequisite for the successful cloning and transfer of genes. Among the multitude of available plasmid assembly strategies, in vivo homologous recombinational cloning in yeast has emerged as a cost-effective and relatively simple method. Since we use this method routinely in our group for assembling large plasmids with secondary metabolite gene clusters and for direct heterologous production of polyketides in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed an exercise module for undergraduate students where they would get hands-on experience with these molecular practices. The exercises target several molecular techniques, including PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, and yeast recombinational cloning. The students will learn about plasmid assembly and yeast transformation methods by performing these experiments while inherently acquiring new skills valuable for their subsequent laboratory work or projects.

AB The online education market share is rapidly increasing, raising the demand to teach sciences outside the laboratory environment. Here, we present Microbiology at Home (M@H), a new approach that integrates hands-on microbiology experimentation with online interactive simulations using authentic scenarios in microbiology in the home environment. The M@H program includes 8 practical activities aligned to the ASM curriculum for practical skills. M@H kits are mailed to students, and each practical activity is prepacked individually with the required consumables, including microbial culture media to prepare at home using a microwave. These practicals are self-paced, and each activity is facilitated using a two-dimensional simulation package with prerecorded videos, protocols, and interactive activities. The students receive both synchronous and asynchronous support and guidance through online learning management systems fora and virtual gatherings. The M@H program was applied to an Introductory Microbiology cohort at the University of New England in 2020 and 2021. Based on student feedback, the experience not only provided real hands-on practice in microbiology but also acted to cement the engagement with the content by contextualizing it to the surrounding home environment. We anticipate that these activities will provide a way to successfully engage students with hands-on microbiology without the need for actual laboratory attendance, thus increasing accessibility to microbial protocols and applications.

   Argumentation is vital in the development of scientific knowledge, and students who can argue from evidence and support their claims develop a deeper understanding of science. In this study, the Argument-Driven Inquiry instruction model was implemented in a two-semester sequence of introductory biology laboratories. Student's scientific argumentation sessions were video recorded and analyzed using the Assessment of Scientific Argumentation in the Classroom observation protocol. This protocol separates argumentation into three subcategories: cognitive (how the group develops understanding), epistemic (how consistent the group's process is with the culture of science), and social (how the group members interact with each other). We asked whether students are equally skilled in all subcategories of argumentation and how students' argumentation skills differ based on lab exercise and course. Students scored significantly higher on the social than the cognitive and epistemic subcategories of argumentation. Total argumentation scores were significantly different between the two focal investigations in Biology Laboratory I but not between the two focal investigations in Biology Laboratory II. Therefore, student argumentation skills were not consistent across content; the design of the lab exercises and their implementation impacted the level of argumentation that occurred. These results will ultimately aid in the development and expansion of Argument-Driven Inquiry instructional models, with the goal of further enhancing students' scientific argumentation skills and understanding of science.

AB When coordinating teams of teaching assistants (TAs) in our courses, it can be time and resource prohibitive to provide mentorship for individual professional development of their teaching. Peer observation of teaching is a useful and effective approach for professional development and for forming a community of practice that TAs can engage in. However, structured peer observation can require substantial training - which may make it infeasible for large teams of TAs with variable teaching expertise and limited contract hours. This article describes the development of an observation protocol, adapted for the TA context, from the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS; by Smith et al. 2013). We have used this successfully, with very minimal training (15-min discussion plus one practice observation). I include the modified form (COPUS-TA) for practical and immediate use in supporting the development of TAs' teaching skills.

   Antibiotic Resistance (ABR) is a global concern and while many students are aware of this issue, many of them are unclear on the mechanisms by which ABR may emerge. The mechanism of horizontal gene transfer is something many students are not familiar with. In this curriculum contribution we present 2 versions of an 'interrupted case study' that is designed as an introduction to horizontal gene transfer for early major students and as a review case for advanced major students in biology and life sciences. The case is based on an authentic patient who developed infections with both methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistant S. aureus. The interrupted case study is appropriate for small and large groups and engages students while content is introduced in a highly structured way. This type of case study can be done by novice and seasoned instructors and lead to considerable learning gains in both introductory and intermediate microbiology courses.

AB Determining the antibiotic sensitivity of disease-causing microorganisms is a fundamental process in a clinical microbiology laboratory. With the continued use of antibiotics, the emergence of antibiotic resistance has become a significant health issue. However, the principles and laboratory testing to determine antibiotic sensitivity are generally not taught to first-year undergraduate students. This is partly due to the limited time to cover the fundamental biology of microorganisms and the mechanism of action of antibiotics in an introductory course. We overcame these limitations by teaching first-year students the fundamental principles of antibiotic sensitivity using an online data generator/simulation. Using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test, students replicated the effects of antibiotic dose on bacterial growth and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of their allocated bacterium. After 2-3 weeks, the antimicrobial sensitivity testing was replicated in an authentic face-to-face laboratory setting over 2 days. The impact of the intervention on student learning was assessed using a written laboratory report and a short questionnaire containing Likert and free-text questions. Student self-reported understanding of the content rose significantly, with nearly all students passing the written assessment. The approach was found to be enjoyable and interactive and facilitated authentic learning in first-year students. This cohort of students will continue to use more advanced versions of this simulation in future years, allowing for the long-term benefits of this approach to be assessed.

AB In discipline-based education research (DBER), early career scholars, such as graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, observe a slew of possible career pathways. Yet, there is a lack of opportunities to learn about such pathways, particularly when transitioning from traditional science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) disciplinary training into a DBER position. Thus, the DBER Scholars-in-Training Professional Development subcommittee was created within the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research (SABER) community to develop a collection of workshops that would serve the greatest professional development needs of early career scholars entering DBER. Through a series of surveys disseminated over multiple years, early career scholars expressed interest in better navigating their career options, which led to the development of the career panel workshop, held during the 2019 and 2020 SABER Annual National Conferences. In this report, we explore the development, implementation, and results of two career panel workshops and compare and contrast the 2019 in-person workshop with the 2020 virtual workshop. We also offer our insights on the value of the career workshop, discuss the next steps, and explore valuable resources for those planning on organizing similar events.

AB Gateway college science courses continue to exclude students from science, disproportionately discriminating against students of color. As the higher education system strives to reduce discrimination, we need a deliberate, iterative process to modify, supplement, or replace current modalities. By incorporating antiracist, just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive (AJEDI) principles throughout course design, instructors create learning environments that provide an antidote to historically oppressive systems. In this paper, we describe how a community of microbiology instructors who all teach Tiny Earth, a course-based undergraduate research experience, created and rapidly integrated antiracist content and pivoted to an online format in response to the social unrest and pandemic of 2020. The effort strengthened an existing teaching community of practice and produced collective change in classrooms across the nation. We provide a perspective on how instructor communities of practice can be leveraged to design and disseminate AJEDI curriculum.

AB In April 2020, New York City's K-12 schools, colleges, and universities went into lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and faculty began converting face-to-face classes into distance learning classes. Teachers and college faculty learned to use new technology to continue instruction for the remainder of the academic year. Learning curves were steep for some, as using technology proved to be overwhelming. Students who registered for in-person classes had to learn in an online environment. Pre-Health Science majors who heavily rely on practical, hands-on courses to gain the necessary skills required for their career participated in virtual anatomy and physiology laboratories. Clearly, face-to-face courses are not always possible; therefore, it is imperative to know the best practices of online teaching and learning.

TI Inside the Undergraduate Immunology Classroom: Current Practices that
   Provide a Framework for Curriculum Consensus
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

ID MICROBIOLOGY; GUIDELINES; IDEAS
AB Although immunological research has become increasingly important in recent decades for understanding infectious and immune-mediated diseases, immunological pedagogy at the undergraduate level has lagged behind in reports of evidence-based scholarship. To address the need for a renewed emphasis on immunology education and to describe the current status of undergraduate education in immunology, an online survey of instructors with experience in teaching immunology was conducted. The survey investigated the effects of instructors' level of teaching experience, target student population, and course components on the emphasis given to certain immunology subtopics in their courses. Instructor teaching experience and current role in teaching influenced the proportion of time allotted to lab techniques, clinical topics, and evolutionary aspects, but type of institution (undergraduate and graduate degree-granting institutions) did not affect course content or emphasis on subtopics. Topics that received the greatest emphasis were the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system, host-pathogen interactions, and molecular mechanisms. Vaccines, hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, and essential immunology techniques were ranked slightly lower, while topics such as evolution, metabolism and antibody purification received the least emphasis. Inclusion of a lab component increased time given to lab-related and clinical topics but did not affect the perceived importance of various scientific competencies. These data describe current curricular practices of instructors who have experience teaching immunology and inform curricular priorities and course design frameworks for undergraduate immunology education.

TI First-Day Info Sheets: A Tool to Prompt Semester-Long Inclusive Teaching
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID STUDENT; IMMEDIACY
AB What faculty do and say on the first day of class is crucial to establishing and maintaining an inclusive learning environment for the duration of the semester. First-day information sheets ("info sheets") are commonly used by instructors. By making simple modifications to this tool, we can gather more information about the goals and experiences of our students, the lives of our students outside of our classroom, and how our students' lives may impact their engagement with the course material and course structure. We can also use this information to actively highlight to students that their full selves (names, pronouns, background) belong in our biology classroom. We provide a set of prompts and suggested steps, rooted in the scholarly literature, to encourage and facilitate faculty use of info-sheets as a valuable tool to inform semester-long inclusive teaching efforts.

DT Editorial Material
AB This study assesses the educational impact of virtual reality (VR) on student learning and engagement in a sophomore-level cell biology course taught at Otterbein University. Using VR, students toured the cell and its environment within the human body. Next, students completed a team challenge where they worked as pairs to match images of cell components taken from the virtual reality application with the appropriate name. Finally, students were given a voluntary survey that presented questions about their perceptions of the VR experience and the associated cell sorting activity. Survey results revealed that a majority of students enjoyed the VR experience and felt that it had a positive impact on their education. These results indicate the potential supportive role that VR may have in a variety of undergraduate courses.

AB Disseminating and communicating scientific findings is an acknowledged part of the research experience, but few science programs include explicit undergraduate curricula for practicing oral science communication. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) can provide opportunities for students to practice science communication, but few studies describe or assess authentic oral science communication activities within CUREs, and none do so under hybrid conditions. The existing literature lacks substantial evidence for how science communication activities impact students' science identity and science communication self-efficacy, specifically regarding research posters. To address this, we collected students' quantitative and qualitative perceptions of science identity and science communication self-efficacy in a hybrid CURE and collected students' qualitative perceptions of presenting their research remotely at a virtual poster symposium. We found that students' science identity and science communication self-efficacy improved significantly, as well as benefits and complaints about presenting research virtually, namely, reduced stress, a more comfortable atmosphere, but a murkier communication channel. Our results should prove valuable to educators interested in improving students' science identity and science communication self-efficacy, especially when limited to a virtual or hybrid format, as affective factors strongly impact students' persistence in science.

ID SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
AB DivulgaMicro is a Brazilian Science Communication and Outreach project run by three young female scientists. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we promoted the first virtual edition of the DivulgaMicro Workshop. Here, we describe adaptations implemented to deliver the virtual edition, and its assessment by the participants. We offered a 3-day workshop addressing manuscript writing and publishing, poster design and oral presentations, and strategies for effectively communicating with the lay public, on the first, second, and third days, respectively. Each daily session was divided into short lectures and active learning through interactive and cooperative activities. We applied pre- and postsession surveys daily to assess participants' learning and an opinion questionnaire at the end of the workshop. We selected 50 of 221 applicants, but only 38 participants took the course. Correct answers were significantly higher (P< 0.01) in the post-session surveys each day. Most of the 34 participants who answered the opinion questionnaire (97%) would recommend the work shop to their colleagues. Participants stated the work chop content was transmitted clearly and straightforwardly and considered the online format suitable for knowledge acquisition. Participants were satisfied with the organization, dynamics, and interactivity. Topics addressed on the third (61.8%) and first days (23.5%) were most liked and were considered most useful in the participants' careers. We believe that the overall success of the workshop is due to the combination or short lectures with active learning activities, the use of virtual platforms that enabled effective communication between participants and instructors, and the support of our collaborators.

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged undergraduate instructors and students in an unprecedented manner. Each has needed to find creative ways to continue the engaged teaching and learning process in an environment defined by physical separation and emotional anxiety and uncertainty. As a potential tool to meet this challenge, we developed a set of curricular materials that combined our respective life science teaching interests with the real-time scientific problem of the COVID-19 pandemic in progress. Discrete modules were designed that are engaging to students, implement active learning-based course-work in a variety of institutional and learning settings, and can be used either in person or remotely. The resulting interdisciplinary curriculum, dubbed "COVID-360," enables instructors to select from a menu of curricular options that best fit their course content, desired activities, and mode of class delivery. Here we describe how we devised the COVID-360 curriculum and how it represents our efforts to creatively and effectively respond to the instructional needs of diverse students in the face of an ongoing instructional crisis.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all spheres of life, including the world of education. Within no time, the once-bustling university classrooms were compelled to be moved online, leaving the educators to rely on virtual engagement tools. This, in turn, has heightened the impact of virtual professional development in higher education, not just nationally but also internationally. As we look toward finding ways and means to engage students in effective classroom instruction, there are still parts of the globe making this transition to online instruction without cutting-edge technologies. This article, therefore, highlights the importance of engaging educators in virtual professional development activities as part of international outreach and details the author's experience using the Avida-ED platform for a novel international teaching partnership. Traditionally, international outreach activities have been pursued through distinct platforms like Fulbright, sabbatical, and other international collaborations. The ongoing pandemic therefore presents a unique opportunity to propagate professional development activities on a virtual platform by emphasizing scientific teaching practices as they relate to the STEM fields. If undertaken, these endeavors ultimately benefit educators across the globe by not only equipping them with various pedagogical tools and resources for their online instruction but also paving the way toward establishing international partnerships and collaborations.

ID BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Structure-function relationships of biological molecules are foundational to undergraduate biology education. In this article and supplemental information, an in-class activity is presented that uses a freely available online game to visualize the nature of chemical bonds as they relate to protein folding and structure. Activity questions and discussion guide students through a consideration of common structural elements as well as the nature of the scientific process. The activity was used in a lab section but could also work as a homework assignment. Student comments from a survey at the end of the course were overwhelmingly positive and indicated the activity helped them appreciate the complexity of protein folding as well as the scientific processes used to solve protein structures.

TI <i>DivulgaMicro</i>: A Brazilian Initiative To Empower Early-Career
   Scientists with Science Communication Skills
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Communication is fundamental in science. Among scientists, communication skills are required to write a comprehensible scientific manuscript or to prepare an attractive oral presentation. In addition, the ability to communicate successfully with the nonscientific community has been increasingly appreciated, as it represents the most effective way to promote popular scientific literacy. Nevertheless, students majoring in science-related courses are not trained specifically for these purposes, and improving communication skills usually depends on tips and advice given by peers. To this end, we have launched DivulgaMicro, an initiative that aims to enhance science communication among early-career scientists in Brazil. DivulgaMicro relies on two major cornerstones: providing online resources via a dedicated website (www.divulgamicro.com.br/index.html) and promoting onsite workshops in universities located in different macro regions of the country. On the website, people can access a collection of fun activities designed to teach scientific concepts to a general audience, along with tips and news regarding public outreach events in Brazil. In the month following its launch, our website had 1,026 visitors from 10 different countries besides Brazil. Regarding the workshops, six were offered during 2018, with nearly 600 attendees. In the course, scientists are presented best practices for scientific writing and oral presentations, as well as techniques to improve communication with lay audiences, such as the use of storytelling structure and analogies. There is a high demand for science communication resources in Brazil, attesting to the importance of initiatives such as DivulgaMicro in our country.

ID TRANSMISSION
AB Using a hands-on approach, this activity introduces students to the concept of viral spread and honey bee pathogenesis by illustrating pathogen transmission throughout the hive. This viral transmission activity, designed for introductory biology, virology, or microbiology classes, can be used in laboratory or lecture settings. Students are provided with information on viral transmission and hive structure. Students then retrieve "pollen" and distribute it to the colony. A UV light passed across students' hands determines which hive was infected, indicating the viral transmission pathways among bees. Students then discuss how viruses impact bees, how long it would take an infected hive to succumb to the pathogen, and what can be done to prevent viral spread.

AB While numerous studies have examined how scientists perceive doing public communication and engagement, there is limited research on undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) student attitudes toward these meaningful activities. Undergraduate students are more diverse than STEM faculty and may serve as boundary spanners in communities, so exploring their motivations and behaviors in STEM engagement is valuable. For scientists, confidence in communication skills is one driver of public engagement behavior. In this study, we utilized a survey to examine how undergraduate STEM students' science communication skills as well as their science identity and science self-efficacy may drive motivation and behaviors in STEM community engagement. Our findings revealed that STEM students are motivated to do community engagement but lack opportunities to actually do these behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that year in academic progression did not increase STEM students' attitudes and behaviors in community engagement. However, science communication skills, science identity, and science self-efficacy were all predictors of student motivation and behaviors in STEM community engagement. These findings suggest that universities should intentionally provide training in science communication, continue providing support for students developing science identity and self-efficacy, and develop opportunities for undergraduate STEM students to do science outreach and engagement activities.

AB Art is a common approach for communicating and educating about science, yet it remains unclear the extent to which science art can benefit varied audiences in varied contexts. To examine this gap, we developed an art exhibit based on the findings of two publications in disease ecology. In study 1, we asked visitors with varying formal science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education backgrounds to complete a survey about their interest in science research before and after viewing the exhibit. In study 2, we recruited upper-level ecology undergraduate students to receive one of three treatments: engage with the art exhibit, read the abstracts of the papers, or do neither. Students completed a comprehension quiz immediately after their learning treatment and again 2 weeks later to evaluate retention. Following the exhibit, visitors who did not report a career or major in STEM showed a greater increase in research interest than visitors who did report a career or major in STEM. For the ecology undergraduate students, comprehension quiz scores were higher for students in the abstract group than the art exhibit group, while both groups scored higher than the control group. Retention of information did not significantly differ between the three groups. Overall, these findings suggest that science art exhibits are an effective method for increasing the accessibility of science to broader audiences and that audience identifiers (e.g., level of formal education in STEM) play an important role in audience experience of science communication and science education initiatives.

AB Collaborative two-stage exams provide an effective mechanism to incorporate group work into summative course assessments. We implemented these exams in an upper-level biology laboratory course over two terms, one with online exams and one with in-person exams.
   Collaborative two-stage exams provide an effective mechanism to incorporate group work into summative course assessments. We implemented these exams in an upper-level biology laboratory course over two terms, one with online exams and one with in-person exams. We compared student exam performance and perceptions of two-stage exams and group work across terms and demographic groups. Quantitative analyses revealed that across three exams per term, students in groups outperformed students who took the exams individually, and on average the group exam benefited all students, in particular students from groups recognized as persons historically excluded from science because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs). Student responses to both closed and open-ended questions indicated overall positive perceptions of both two-stage exams and group work. We found no significant differences in student perceptions based on PEER student status, gender, or the number of exams helped by group exams, but we found differences related to term and group exam approaches. These findings build upon the literature supporting student learning and perceptions from two-stage exams and provide novel insights for a role of group work in decreasing inequities in course assessments.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an abrupt shift in biology courses, with many transitioning to online instruction. This has led to an increased concern about academic integrity and cheating in online courses. Here, I draw upon the peer-reviewed literature to provide evidence-based answers to four questions concerning cheating and online biology courses: (i) What types of cheating are prevalent with the shift to online instruction? (ii) Should instructors make assessments open book and open notes? (iii) How does cheating occur in biology lab courses? (iv) Finally, what strategies can biology instructors take to uphold academic integrity with online learning? I frame these answers not only around academic integrity but on the potential impacts on student learning and discuss some strategies that may not only deter cheating but also promote greater student learning.

AB Traditional postsecondary education is making progress on embracing the diversity of student backgrounds and experiences while preparing them for the demands of STEM careers. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are effective tools to concurrently achieve many student and faculty goals: facilitating training of students, building career competencies, generating publishable research results and enabling research experiences where students apply their knowledge and interest. Georgia State University is not unique with a high student demand for research experiences and mentors that is greater than traditional research faculty labs can accommodate. Georgia State University is, however, unique in that it is a demographically diverse campus which serves minority and non-traditional students (i.e., second career and veterans) and is also rapidly growing. Therefore, to enhance the microbiology curriculum and facilitate authentic research experiences for the growing number of biology majors, a cluster of course-based research experiences in microbial ecology was developed. A former research lab space was converted to a collaborative teaching lab to serve the growth in course offerings, as well as to accommodate multiple microbial ecology research projects occurring in the same space. The courses offered appeal to students, build on the strengths of faculty experiences, and facilitate collaboration amongst students and with the greater Atlanta community. To ensure that our CUREs are accessible to the diverse students in our department, we addressed a variety of logistical and curricular challenges. Solutions to such challenges align with the goals of the university to offer research and signature experiences to ensure students are included and trained in STEM skills.

TI Testing the "Grandma Hypothesis": Characterizing Skin Microbiome
   Diversity as a Project-Based Learning Approach to Genomics
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
AB The constantly evolving nature of genomics provides new challenges for students in Public Health as they try to understand how genomic information relates to health and disease. As Public Health curricula attempt to keep pace with the most recent advances in genomics, students should gain experience with analyzing genomic data and applying genomic tools to the study of health-related issues. To advance undergraduate and graduate student education and provide a more comprehensive view of genomics, we developed an educational project including both pedagogic and research components to characterize skin microbial communities (microbiomes) using targeted amplicon sequencing of their genomes (metataxonomy). All students completed the lab procedures, analyzed 16S rRNA genomic data (formative assessments), and wrote a five-page scientific report summarizing and discussing their results (summative assessment). Student grades for the summative assessment ranged from 31.5 to 40 (out of 40) points. They also successfully completed two practicums (problem sets) focused on microbiome sequence data and responded to 12 minute-papers related to genomic topics covered in class. In all these exercises the 2019 students outperformed 2018 students, who did not participate in this educational lab project. By fulfilling all the requirements of this project-based learning experience, students better understood the complexity of genomics and acquired a valuable set of marketable experience and skills in molecular technologies, bioinformatics and statistics (quantitative skills). Additionally, students were able to generate new valuable microbial 16S rRNA genomic data and test hypotheses about the composition and diversity of the microbes living on our skin (microbiota).

TI Isolation and Characterization of Bacterial Cellulase Producers for
   Biomass Deconstruction: A Microbiology Laboratory Course
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Article
ID BIOFUELS; PATHWAYS; FUELS
AB The conversion of biomass to biofuels presents a solution to one of the largest global challenges of our era, climate change. A critical part of this pipeline is the process of breaking down cellulosic sugars from plant matter to be used by microbes containing biosynthetic pathways that produce biofuels or bioproducts. In this inquiry-based course, students complete a research project that isolates cellulase-producing bacteria from samples collected from the environment. After obtaining isolates, the students characterize the production of cellulases. Students then amplify and sequence the 16S rRNA genes of confirmed cellulase producers and use bioinformatic methods to identify the bacterial isolates. Throughout the course, students learn about the process of generating biofuels and bioproducts through the deconstruction of cellulosic biomass to form monosaccharides from the biopolymers in plant matter. The program relies heavily on active learning and enables students to connect microbiology with issues of sustainability. In addition, it provides exposure to basic microbiology, molecular biology, and biotechnology laboratory techniques and concepts. The described activity was initially developed for the Introductory College Level Experience in Microbiology (iCLEM) program, a research-based immersive laboratory course at the US Department of Energy Joint BioEnergy Institute. Originally designed as an accelerated program for high-potential, low-income, high school students (11th-12th grade), this curriculum could also be implemented for undergraduate coursework in a research-intensive laboratory course at a two-or four-year college or university.

AB Increasing student interest and success in STEM education is a top priority for many postsecondary educational institutions. One well-documented approach to both priorities is to have students participate in a Course Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). Faculty from several technical colleges and universities in Wisconsin teamed up with the Tiny Earth organization to offer a CURE to address the search for new antibiotics. Students enrolled in undergraduate microbiology courses engaged in research and participated in community outreach. To involve the community, faculty from various institutions joined an NFL team, the Green Bay Packers, and created the Tiny Earth in Titletown symposium. Here, students presented their work via scientific posters, to community and industry members, and networked with other scientists from around the region. The Tiny Earth in Titletown symposium started in 2018, was held again in 2019, and returned in 2022 following a 2-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Record attendance in 2022 suggests that community outreach and education may be helping restore trust in science that was lost during the pandemic.

AB In university STEM classrooms, the incorporation of inclusive practices improves student performance, decreases disparities in the academic success of underrepresented students, and increases student retention and persistence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. Inclusive pedagogical practices include effective instructional choices like active learning, providing rubrics, and other strategies that have been shown to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Additionally, explicitly inclusive practices such as addressing microaggressions and sharing pronouns can promote a sense of belonging for students. While a plethora of literature has shown these impacts and faculty have access to resources and training about inclusive pedagogy, we were interested in whether students are noticing these practices and how student identities impact their observations of instructional practices. We surveyed undergraduates (n = 74) from diverse STEM disciplines at a large land-grant university regarding their observation of 11 different inclusive pedagogical practices. Overall, students observed inclusive instructional practices more often than they observed explicitly diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-related practices. For explicitly DEI-related practices, white students observed more practices than Students of Color. This suggests that more work needs to be done to train faculty in explicit DEI-related practices, especially with the goal of supporting Students of Color who have been historically excluded from STEM.

   Understanding molecular processes and coordinating the various activities across levels of organization in biological systems is a complicated task, yet many curricular guidelines indicate that undergraduate students should master it. Employing mechanistic reasoning can facilitate describing and investigating biological phenomena. Biofilms are an important system in microbiology and biology education. However, few empirical studies have been conducted on student learning of biofilms or how students utilize mechanistic reasoning related to systems thinking to explain biofilm formation. Using mechanistic reasoning and the theory of knowledge integration as conceptual and analytical frameworks, we examined the features of 9 undergraduate biology students' mechanistic models of a specific transition point in biofilm development. From these data, we constructed a model of knowledge integration in the context of biofilms, which categorizes students' knowledge based on features of their descriptions (e.g., entities, correct connections, and the nature of connections). We found that 4 of 9 students produced a fragmented model, 4 of 9 students produced a transitional model, and 1 student produced a connected model. Overall, students often did not discuss cell-cell communication mechanics in their mechanistic models and rarely included the role of gene regulation. Most connections were considered nonnormative and lacked important entities, leading to an abundance of unspecified causal connections. We recommend increasing instructional support of mechanistic reasoning within systems (e.g., identifying entities across levels of organization and their relevant activities) and creating opportunities for students to grapple with their understanding of various biological concepts and to explore how processes interact and connect in a complex system.

AB Since the start of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many microbiology lab activities have been conducted online. We produced a simple PCR primer design and virtual PCR activity for introductory students to use as part of an online laboratory course or as an independent activity in a traditional laboratory setting. Most students are aware of basic PCR concepts but struggle with important details, such as how PCR is specific and how false positives and negatives can be generated in a diagnostic test that is not well designed. This exercise helps students review molecular biology concepts within the context of a test that was commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that nursing students and Biology and non-Biology majors were able to complete the worksheet as a group with minimal instructor input. This could be used as a stand-alone activity, as a warm-up for other bioinformatics exercises, or as a prelab activity for actual in-lab quantitative PCR experiments, such as the one offered by miniPCR bio. With minor modifications, it could also be used with more advanced students.

AB Student instructional assistants (IAs) are an integral part of most students' college experience in higher education. When properly trained, IAs can improve students' grades, engagement with course content, persistence, and retention. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the transition of nearly all instructional practices online. At the University of Alabama at Birmingham, IAs, including Biology Learning Assistants (BLAs), began hosting their instructional sessions virtually, outside of class time. The goals of these sessions were to reinforce fundamental concepts using active learning strategies and to address student questions by building a supportive learning community. In this article, we summarize the training and guidance we provided to the BLAs regarding how best to adapt digital educational tools to engage students during their virtual sessions. We recommend that institutions of higher education recognize the expansion of digital educational tools as an opportunity to increase the technological literacy and competence of their IAs to best serve their student body in this increasingly digital age of education.

AB Successful mentoring relationships allow mentees to gain the confidence and knowledge they need to reach their goals, but students from populations generally underrepresented in science and health fields have been shown to receive less mentorship than their well-represented peers. In highly competitive processes, like medical school admissions, mentoring may be particularly valuable. We investigated the prior mentoring experiences of medical students and whether their perceptions of mentoring differed based on their mentoring goals or demographics (race/ethnicity, gender identity, household income, or parental highest level of education) through surveys and interviews of medical students from three different institutions. These medical students had widely participated in mentoring, though student race and household income impacted their access to medical professionals to serve as informal mentors. Medical students shared the same gender identity as their mentor more often than would be expected under the null hypothesis. Students reported having both career and psychosocial goals for mentoring, and there was a positive association between the strength of the mentees' goals for mentoring and the number of formal mentors the mentees had. These respondents viewed mentoring as having provided them with both career and psychosocial benefits. Mentoring programs for aspiring medical students may benefit from focusing on both career and psychosocial functions to maximize the benefits of mentoring for students from diverse backgrounds.

TI An Undergraduate Elective Course That Introduces Topics of Diversity,
   Equity, and Inclusion into Discussions of Science
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID RACIAL BIAS
AB In this Science, Ethics, and Society elective undergraduate course at the St. Louis College of Pharmacy, students consider topics that scientists face continuously, including human and animal subjects, science denial, treatment of scientists, who owns and funds science, personalized medicine and genetics, health disparities, and scientific integrity, all through lenses of inclusion and equity. Students read primary and secondary literature pertaining to each day's topic, upload reflections to a course management system, and engage in structured dialogue in a facilitated classroom environment. Overarching themes address how women and men and their scientific work have been treated or received differently, as well as particular challenges faced by people of color, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and those with disabilities. This course helps students see how the culture of science has been created and sustained, how it has not encouraged equal participation, and how it could be shaped differently. Student responses to the course recognize that this approach to the scientific material is valuable and that it does not appear elsewhere in their curriculum.

AB Promoting diversity and inclusiveness in the STEM academic workforce remains a key challenge and national priority. Scientific societies can play a significant role in this process through the creation and implementation of programs to foster STEM academic workforce diversification, and by providing mentoring and skills development training that empower scientists from under-represented minority (URM) backgrounds to succeed in their communities of practice. In this article, we provide examples of challenges met by scientific societies in these areas and present data from the American Society for Cell Biology, highlighting the benefits received by trainees through long-term engagement with its programs. The success of these initiatives illustrates the impact of discipline-specific programming by scientific societies in supporting the development of URM scientists and an increasingly diverse and inclusive academic STEM community.

AB In this article, we explore culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) to work toward alleviating persistent underrepresentation in STEM fields of oppressed minorities. We argue that biology instructors can practice agency, or the capacity to act in ways that undermine opportunity gaps that lead to underrepresentation, by developing themselves into culturally relevant pedagogues who are committed to underrepresented minority (URM) students' learning and career success, who demonstrate cultural competence, and who develop a sociopolitical consciousness regarding the culturally laden nature of their discipline. We then explore Gregor Mendel's story to demonstrate the culturally laden nature of the history of science as well as the nature of our current curricular canon. The article concludes with a postulated alternative method to genetics education in a general biology course that reflects the culturally laden nature of our genetics knowledge, as well as our current understanding of inheritance.

AB Our ability to collect and access large quantities of data over the last decade has been revolutionary for many social sciences. Suddenly, it is possible to measure human behavior, performance, and activity on an unprecedented scale, opening the door to fundamental advances in discovery and understanding. Yet such access to data has limitations that, if not sufficiently addressed and explored, can result in significant over-sights. Here we discuss recent research that used data from a large global sample of high school students to demonstrate, paradoxically, that in nations with higher gender equality, fewer women pursued science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees than would be expected based on aptitude in those subjects. The reasons for observed patterns is central to current debates, with frequent disagreement about the nature and magnitude of problems posed by the lack of female representation in STEM and the best ways to deal with them. In our international efforts to use big data in education research, it is necessary to critically consider its limitations and biases.

TI Place-Based Case Studies: A New Approach to an Effective Teaching
   Practice
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB Case-based approaches have been used extensively in STEM classrooms to enhance the real-world applicability of course content. Prior research in the bioeducation field indicates, specifically, that such methods lead to increases in students' conceptual understanding and affect in the discipline relative to more traditional methods. Despite these outcomes, the majority of case study exercises are formatted in a generalist manner. In other words, the content and context of the case study itself are not framed around the communities in which the students live. In an effort to address this concern, we developed and implemented a series of place-based case study (PBCS) exercises within the introductory cell and molecular biology courses at our institutions. A comparative, quasi-experimental approach was used to evaluate the impact of PBCSs versus non-PBCSs on cognitive and non-cognitive student outcomes. Results indicated that both PBCSs and non-PBCSs led to increases in students' content knowledge; however, no statistically significant difference existed in post-exercise performance between the PBCS and non-PBCS cohorts at the University of Texas, for instance, after controlling for confounding factors. Importantly, data also revealed that students within the PBCS cohort agreed more strongly that the case studies provided them with a better understanding of how scientific advancements and research impacted the community in which they lived than did their peers in the non-PBCS cohort. Collectively, these outcomes suggest that PBCSs offer a scalable, classroom-based approach to engage students in relevant, practical experiences that are of direct interest to them and, ideally, the broader scientific community.

TI The Convergent Effect of International Collaboration between Young
   Leaders of Two Global Societies: Strengthening Microbiology Education
   and Training Practices Worldwide
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB There has never been a more critical time than the present for young microbiologists to engage in continuous postgraduate education. Next-generation microbiologists need to integrate several scientific disciplines in the early stages of their careers to keep up with the ever-changing nature of microbiology (advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms, bioinformatics, complex omit, culture and systems-biology approaches) and to ensure timely response to the current global health and biodiversity threats. Here we propose that international collaboration of young experts would help to address the challenges in microbiology training and serve as a communication bridge between senior and early career scientists. To establish a one-of-a-kind collaboration, the Trainee Association (TAE) of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the Young Leaders Circle (YLC) of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) have joined forces to adequately represent the interests of young members within the two largest societies in the field of microbiology. Through this partnership, both societies aim to promote continuous education for young scientists and the general public. Additionally, we intend to identify shared objectives and introduce joint activities that could lead to a beneficial exchange process for a long-lasting relationship. This partnership further contributes to advancing both the quality and quantity of education.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in authentic research and generally increase the participation rate of students in research. Students' participation in research has a positive impact on their science identity and self-efficacy, both of which can predict integration of students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), especially for underrepresented students. The main goal of this study was to investigate instructor-initiated CUREs implemented as upper-level elective courses in the Biomedical Sciences major. We hypothesized that these CUREs would (i) have a positive impact on students' scientific identity and self-efficacy and (ii) result in gains in students' self-assessed skills in laboratory science, research, and science communication. We used Likert-type surveys developed by Estrada et al. (14) under the Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence to measure scientific identity, self-efficacy, and scientific value orientation. When data from all CUREs were combined, our results indicate that students' self-efficacy and science identity significantly increased after completion. Students' self-assessment of research and lab-related skills was significantly higher after completion of the CUREs. We also observed that prior to participation in the CUREs, students' self-assessment of molecular and bioinformatic skills was low, when compared with microbiological skills. This may indicate strengths and gaps in our curriculum that could be explored further.

AB Meaningful pedagogical reform requires good faculty training and support programs. Such support is particularly valuable when colleges and universities are trying to bring research and inquiry into the laboratory curricula under resource-limited conditions. In this situation, it may help to extend the scope of the faculty support program to include training for practicing experimental techniques, sustainable networking opportunities, and a space to learn about pedagogical reforms. From this perspective, we share our experience about building a faculty development program for public college teachers who teach undergraduate biology in India. Though we designed the program for low-resource settings, the experiments curated could very well represent core biological concepts typically identified by the international community. The activities and overall design of the program can be useful for initiating pedagogical reform in any college/university where the traditional approach to biology laboratory instruction predominates, and high-end research is not easy to access.

AB Scientific contributions by members from historically marginalized communities (HMCs) have been largely ignored, uncredited, and in some cases erased from history. This has contributed to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) curricula lacking diversity. In this study, we present an Honors seminar course aimed to highlight the discoveries of scientists from HMCs, centered around reading primary literature in a way that builds our students' research skills. The course provides students with opportunities for active learning, skill building, and mentorship that are key for persistence of students in the STEM "leaky pipeline." Students also read biographies of scientists from HMCs, interact with guest speakers, and choose scientists to highlight (in final papers and presentations) and publicize (through the creation of Wikipedia pages). Additionally, students use community-building methodologies to build a safe classroom and gain tools to have conversations about diversity, inequities, and intersectionality in STEM. In self-reporting surveys, 93.7% of students strongly agreed that their appreciation for marginalized scientists increased and 92.6% reported that the course met very well the goal of refining their research skills. These findings support the effectiveness of this novel course. We provide two lists (one of 137 scientists and one of 57 scientist biographies) that will allow faculty teaching a wide range of science classes to select examples of scientists and discoveries to highlight in their courses. This course represents a novel platform to diversify STEM curricula while engaging and empowering students from historically marginalized communities.

AB One Health concepts were incorporated in a foodborne disease outbreak investigation with game features of data presented as visual and manipulative clues. Postsecondary pre-veterinary medicine and animal biosciences students and food science students (n = 319) enrolled in an introductory animal and food sciences course over a 3-year period received a brief introduction to foodborne illness, an outbreak scenario, and investigative tasks to complete individually or in groups. Tasks addressed epidemiology, laboratory, environment, traceback, recall, and prevention concepts. Gamification of the exercise involved generation of a numerical code to unlock a combination lock as an indication of successful organization, compilation, and interpretation of data. Students presented investigation findings and responses to critical thought questions on their roles. Student surveys on engagement and self-perceived change in conceptual understanding indicated that nearly all expressed increased understanding of outbreak investigations, safe food production, and environmental water as a transmission vehicle. Volunteered learned concepts indicated enhanced appreciation for the complexity of food safety and interdisciplinary connections. Students enjoyed the exercise (92%) and cited the clues and group interaction among the most enjoyable features. Objective assessment of student conceptual learning with the subset of students who conducted the investigation individually (n = 58) demonstrated significant increase in correct test responses (49% pretest; 76% posttest) after completion of the investigation for all questions combined and across all learning objectives. These data demonstrate the value of a foodborne disease investigation with escape room gamification features for engaging students in One Health concepts and exercising problem-solving, critical thinking, and skills for independent and collaborative work.

ID IDENTIFICATION; SCIENCE
AB The eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic forced many universities to quickly transition traditional in-person laboratory courses to an online format for remote learning. Consequently, learning objectives focused on hands-on laboratory skills shifted to ones that assess skills that could be recapitulated in the online format. We have transitioned a staple experiment in most undergraduate microbiology labs, the Bacterial Unknown Project, for online delivery using the university Learning Management System (LMS). We maintained those learning objectives suited for online delivery, such as creating an experimental design for identifying an unknown bacterium and communicating scientific results, while replacing or modifying those which could not be replicated, such as demonstration of sterile techniques, with learning objectives that highlighted skills of collaboration, peer evaluation, and scientific communication. Assessment of these new and modified learning objectives demonstrated positive student learning. Additionally, an anonymous post-project survey asked students whether they perceived the online Bacterial Unknown Project had increased their skill level in the areas highlighted by the revised learning objectives. Results reflected that 80% of the students reported the Unknown Project had increased their skills in all areas evaluated.

AB Although many science education researchers have investigated developing science education at the K-12 levels to meet the needs of underrepresented students in science, far fewer have considered how shifts to online instruction in undergraduate science courses might provide insights into better supporting the achievement of students from diverse backgrounds at the university level. This case study aims to fill this gap by engaging in a reflective interdisciplinary "deep dive" into the instruction of one biochemistry professor at a designated Hispanic-Serving Institution, across two distinct modalities: face-to-face and online. The findings reported here suggest that the use of formative assessments and student feedback surveys, as well as responsive instructional strategies, facilitate access to and comprehension of complex material in the online modality, without diminishing achievement. Additionally, the reflective collaboration deployed methodologically in this study highlights how higher education faculty can marshal intellectual resources across distinct disciplines to identify and develop responsive pedagogy in advanced science courses at the university level.

TI Negative Impacts of the Current COVID-19 Crisis on Science Education in
   Kenya: How Certain Can We Be about the Efficacy of the Science Learning
   Framework Online?
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently, there has been a significant interest in the possibility of continued disruption to school learning due to the spiraling COVID-19 crisis worldwide. Consequently, online learning has been widely adopted. However, in the least- and medium-developed countries like Kenya, the digital learning models used particularly for science-based courses have either been superficial or ambiguous, making it difficult for students to properly grasp concepts. Conducting online lectures of STEM subjects, without providing simulations and experimental learning experiences, is defective, since such an approach does not appreciate the inherent uncertainty concerns in science education. Besides, delivering only theoretical virtual lectures without integrating students' ideas may be ineffective. The approach masks certain skills that are important for proper interpretation of scientific concepts. This paper presents a framework to examine the detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on science education and also an out-of-class learning framework that addresses some of the uncertainties. The proposed framework consists of four blocks: (i) a theoretical virtual lecture model that impacts the basics of the scientific concept to be studied; (ii) simulation model to stimulate the understanding of the experimental concept; (iii) a home-based experimental model that propagates the understanding between (i) and (ii); and (iv) an interactive feedback model attributed to the proportion of the home-based experimental activity outcomes to model assumptions and objective values. This structure can be of great benefit to students as it incorporates key tenets of interest to the future for learning of science outside the classroom.

TI The Virtual Streptococcal Seminar Series and Trainee Symposium:
   Adaptations of a Research Community during the COVID-19 Pandemic
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has forced academic research communities to develop online means of learning, networking, and engaging in new research. To allow increased interaction and engagement of the streptococcal research community during the COVID-19 shutdown, we organized the Virtual Streptococcal Seminar Series and Virtual Streptococcal Trainee Symposium and advertised via email and social media outlets. The seminar series initially met weekly on Thursdays at 12 pm Eastern Daylight Time and transitioned to monthly seminars, while the trainee symposium spanned 3 days in September 2020. In this study, we analyzed seminar attendance data and online recording accesses from the first 20 seminars and found community engagement to be independent of speaker gender, career stage, geographic location, and organism of interest, averaging 124 live views and 1,683 recording accesses per seminar. We also report attendance and speaker statistics from the 3-day Virtual Streptococcal Trainee Symposium, which hosted a total of 38 trainees from five continents presenting on Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus suis, oral streptococci, or Enterococcus faecalls. The Virtual Streptococcal Trainee Symposium averaged 119 live attendees per session with a total of 220 unique viewers from six continents across the 3-day event. We conclude that while online platforms do not replace in-person conferences, the seminar and symposium have successfully engaged the streptococcal research community and have provided a forum for scientific sharing during the COVID-19 crisis.

AB Evidence-based teaching practices (EBTP)-like inquiry-based learning, inclusive teaching, and active learning (AL)-have been shown to benefit all students, especially women, first-generation, and traditionally minoritized students in science fields. However, little research has focused on how best to train teaching assistants (TAs) to use EBTP or on which components of professional development are most important. We designed and experimentally manipulated a series of presemester workshops on AL, dividing subjects into two groups. The Activity group worked in teams to learn an AL technique with a workshop facilitator. These teams then modeled the activity, with their peers acting as students. In the Evidence group, facilitators modeled the activities with all TAs acting as students. We used a mixed-methods research design (specifically, concurrent triangulation) to interpret pre- and postworkshop and postsemester survey responses. We found that Evidence group participants reported greater knowledge of AL after the workshop than Activity group participants. Activity group participants, on the other hand, found all of the AL techniques more useful than Evidence group participants. These results suggest that actually modeling AL techniques made them more useful to TAs than simply experiencing the same techniques as students-even with the accompanying evidence. This outcome has broad implications for how we provide professional development sessions to TAs and potentially to faculty.

TI Building the <i>lac</i> Operon: A Guided-Inquiry Activity Using
   3D-Printed Models
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Undergraduate biology courses rely heavily on visual representation of information. Students view images of plants, animals, and microbes, interpret data presented in graphs, and use drawings to understand how cells and molecules interact in three dimensions. Traditional teaching approaches exclude students with visual impairments and disadvantage students with disabilities that affect their interpretation and processing of visual and spatial information, and also students who simply do not identify as "visual learners." By using new technologies to develop tactile teaching tools (TTTs) that can be employed in classrooms, we aim to create inclusive learning environments and more effectively instruct diverse learners. The advent of affordable and accessible 3D printing technology makes it possible to create tactile models that represent molecules, cells, and entire organisms more accurately than traditional visual representations. We describe the assessment of a 3D gene expression puzzle as a guided inquiry learning activity in which students must correctly assemble a series of components in order to achieve an output. Upon completion of the puzzle, the TTT provides tactile feedback through vibration to signal transcriptional activation. Analysis of pre- and postassessment performance demonstrated statistically significant increases in individual students' paired assessment scores in two different classroom implementations, with a greater effect size at a rural minority-serving institution than an urban R1 university. These encouraging preliminary data suggest that TTTs with guided-inquiry learning disproportionately benefit disadvantaged student populations and could serve as a tool in leveling the playing field when teaching abstract biological concepts in diverse educational settings.

TI An Introduction to CRISPR-Mediated Genome Editing in Fungi
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Central dogma, transformation, and genome editing are key biological concepts for which junior scientists must gain experience during training. Here we present an exercise that introduces these concepts in a single practical laboratory exercise. Our exercise utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to introduce a stop codon into Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADE2. This edit leads to the buildup of an adenine precursor that dyes the edited cells red. As the repair template, guide RNA, and Cas9 are all encoded in our vector, transformation can be performed in 2 hours. Furthermore, since all components of the Cas9/CRISPR system are encoded by the vector, specialized equipment and reagents, such as a PCR machine or oligonucleotides, are not required to perform the experiments as designed. As such, these exercises provide an efficient cost-effective introduction to a wide variety of key molecular biology concepts and lay the foundation for more rigorous investigations in upper-level classes and independent research projects.

AB Bioinformatics brings together biology, mathematics, statistics, and computer science to analyze biological sequence information. Anyone with a computer, access to the Internet, and basic training in this field can contribute to genomics research. Yet many biology faculty feel they lack training in the use of bioinformatics tools and therefore include little bioinformatics content in their courses. To overcome this challenge, the Genome Solver Project was created to empower undergraduate faculty by offering training and resources for creating hands-on bioinformatics course materials. In this study, we show the results of one survey completed directly after the workshop and a further follow-up survey to gain insight into the impact the workshop had on faculty willingness to include bioinformatics content in their courses and what challenges they still faced. We also measured student performance at five different institutions using a 20-question multiple-choice quiz delivered before and after bioinformatics instruction. Data collected from 640 students at these five schools demonstrated student performance increased, suggesting that bioinformatics training workshops can be an effective means of encouraging faculty to engage in bioinformatics instruction and positively influence student learning.

ID TEXTBOOK
AB In the microbial world, cell size and shape impact physiology, but students struggle to visualize spatial relationships between cells and macromolecules. In prokaryotic cells, cell size is limited by reliance on diffusion for nutrient uptake and the transport of nutrients within the cell. Cells must also meet a minimum size threshold to accommodate essential cellular components such as ribosomes and DNA. Using 3D printing allows for the creation of custom models that can be influential teaching tools in the biology classroom. This lesson uses 3D cell models to teach students enrolled in an introductory microbiology course about bacterial cell size and the biological importance of surface-area-to-volume ratio. During the lesson, students interact with 3D cell models and discuss a series of questions in small groups. Student learning was assessed using quantitative and qualitative student response data collected pre- and post-lesson. Student achievement of learning objectives, and their confidence in their knowledge of these concepts, improved post-lesson, and these gains were statistically significant. Our findings suggest that interacting with 3D-printed cell models improves student understanding about bacterial cell size and diffusion.

AB The subject of scientific literacy has never been more critical to the scientific community as well as society in general. As opportunities to spread misinformation increase with the rise of new technologies, it is critical for society to have at its disposal the means for ensuring that its citizens possess the basic scientific literacy necessary to make critical decisions on topics like climate change, biotechnology, and other science-based issues. As the Guest Editors of this themed issue of the Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education, we present a wide array of techniques that the scientific community is using to promote scientific literacy in both academic and nonacademic settings. The diversity of the techniques presented here give us confidence that the scientific community will rise to the challenge of ensuring that our society will be prepared to make fact-based and wise decisions that will preserve and improve our quality of life.

AB Immune literacy-the ability to hear, learn, read, write, explain, and discuss immunological content with varied audiences-has become critically important in recent years. Yet, with its complex terminology and discipline-specific concepts, educating individuals about the immune system and its role in health and disease may seem daunting. Here, we reflect on how to demystify the discipline and increase its accessibility for a broader audience. To address this, a working group of immunology educators from diverse institutions associated with the research coordination network, ImmunoReach, convened virtually. As a result of these discussions, we request a call to action for a system-level change and present a set of practical recommendations that novice and experienced educators from diverse institutions, professional societies, and policymakers may adopt to foster immune literacy in their classrooms and communities.

AB Over a century of attention to "science literacy for all " has not produced a public that can appreciate a common body of core science facts, concepts, and methods; nor have many acquired from their years in K-12 education the ability to apply science learning to everyday problems or to the scientific issues that concern a democracy. Some have called the endeavor impossible and moved on to lesser goals of science appreciation and heuristic guides to choosing trusted experts. However, a route to science literacy may yet be possible, if we redefine the goal as achieving literacy within a community. The tools for that end are different from what is generally offered in the classroom. What will be more helpful is a set of core values that underlie the generation of science concepts and facts, that inform the methods of science, and most importantly, that enable the social interchange that is the essence of the scientific endeavor. These values-the ethos of science-should be offered to elementary school students as a culture that forms through inquiry into questions students bring with them from their own experiences. Suggestions are offered as to how this might come about, with the central role occupied by the teacher as model and with the culture nurtured by the teacher, by a practitioner from the world of science, and eventually by the energy and contributions of the students themselves.

TI Pandemic-Related Instructor Talk: How New Instructors Supported Students
   at the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MOTIVATION; CLASSROOM
AB At the same time that COVID-19 cases in the United States first began to increase, fellows in a mentored teaching apprenticeship for postdoctoral scientists began to teach undergraduate seminars. The fellows suddenly needed to support students emotionally and switch to online instruction. They decided to acknowledge and address the pandemic during each class. In this case study, we examined the language fellows used in response to this encouragement, hypothesizing that they would engage in a variety of pandemic-related instructor talk, i.e., language that instructors use in the classroom that is not directly tied to educational content. We analyzed transcripts from 17 2-h undergraduate biology seminar courses and found 167 instances of pandemic-related instructor talk. We used grounded theory to identify categories that emerged from these quotations: Positive coping mechanisms and self-care; Adjusting to online learning; Compassionate instruction; Personal impacts; COVID-19 and society; Dreaming; and Biology of COVID-19. Talk in these categories may help build relationships among instructors and students. The category about quickly Adjusting to online learning is unique, in that it is unlikely that there will be another time that will require simultaneous and rapid national movement to online instruction. In addition, four of the seven categories are direct consequences of COVID-19 specifically and thus are unique to this study. Analyzing pandemic-related instructor talk has shed light on how new instructors navigated the trials of the time.

TI A Large-Class Undergraduate Microbiology Laboratory Activity on
   Microbial Diversity and Antimicrobial Resistance
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The investigation of microbial diversity and adaptation is essential to comprehend biological processes. Yet, teaching basic microbiology techniques to large groups of students in limited time is challenging, as most approaches are time-consuming or require special equipment. In this activity, students performed three laboratory exercises in three hours involving the analysis of inoculated agar plates they prepared by swabbing samples from an environment of their choice, the examination of antimicrobial effects on growth, and the assessment of microbial enzymatic activity in soil. The activity was field tested in two classes (70 and 76 students, respectively) of first-year undergraduate biology and zoology students at the Bangor University (UK) using pre- and post-tests (n = 84). Based on the answers, learning gain scores (G) were calculated for each learning objective (LO). For all LOs, the mean post-test scores were higher than the mean pre-test scores. The activity significantly improved students' understanding of microbial diversity (G = 0.36, p = 0.010) and microbial detection and quantification (G = 0.18 to 0.773, p = 0.004). The lack of significant differences in scores for questions targeting microbial growth (G = 0.31, p = 0.292) and antimicrobial resistance (G = 0.38, p = 0.052) suggested some existing knowledge amongst undergraduates. However, the extent of knowledge showed great variation. The results may suggest that the activity is suitable to introduce microbiology-related laboratory work to students with limited laboratory skills and knowledge. Furthermore, the pre- and posttest approach used here is suitable for both course evaluation and monitoring attainment and can be used for program validation and quality control.

TI Inclusive Science: Inspiring 8th Graders from Underrepresented Groups to
   Embrace STEM with Microbiology and Immunology
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Inclusivity in STEM requires practices that include transforming the culture in a classroom. This can be done not only by placing value on diversity but also by providing an engaging student experience, instilling a sense of belonging, and encouraging students at all levels to use a critical lens to solve problems. As a way to develop an inclusive science curriculum for students in a community that is among the poorest in New York state, local STEM organization Rise High Inc. partners with experts in STEM fields, K-12 educators, mentors, and community organizations to create sustainable low-cost, high-quality, engaging, and relevant content that sparks curiosity and exploration for this underserved community. The educators and mentors also have a unique opportunity to develop self-awareness about their own pathways and how they can use their experiences to enrich the classroom. An exemplary case is this highly interactive two-part instructional module in Microbiology and Immunology, which targets 8th graders and was designed in partnership with a local expert in these fields. This module offers creative means to learn and apply knowledge in realistic ways, while using easy-to-access materials in classrooms.

TI Undergraduates Phenotyping <i>Arabidopsis</i> Knockouts in a
   Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience: Exploring Plant Fitness
   and Vigor Using Quantitative Phenotyping Methods
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID BENEFITS; SCIENCES; PIPELINE
AB We present a curriculum description, an initial student outcome investigation, and sample scientific results for a representative Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) that is part of the "Undergraduates Phenotyping Arabidopsis Knockouts" (unPAK) network. CUREs in the unPAK network characterize quantitative phenotypes of the model plant Arabidopsis from across environments to uncover connections between genotype and phenotype. Students in unPAK CUREs grow plants in a replicated block design and make quantitative measurements throughout the semester. This CURE enables students to answer plant science questions that draw from fields such as environmental science, genetics, ecology, and evolution. Findings indicate that this experience provides students with opportunities to make relevant scientific discoveries. Eighty percent of student datasets produced from the CURE met criteria for inclusion in the project database, indicative of student learning in data collection and analysis of quantitative plant traits. Student datasets uncovered novel effects of mutation on plant form. In addition, students' science self-efficacy increased as a result of course participation, and faculty feedback on course implementation was positive. We present unPAK as a new network that supports CUREs and research experiences focused on collecting biological data made publicly available to the scientific community. The unPAK CUREs can be tailored to address instructor interests or pedagogical needs while involving students in research investigating quantitative plant phenotypes.

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Assessing learning across a biology major can help departments monitor achievement of broader program-level goals and identify opportunities for curricular improvement. However, biology departments have lacked suitable tools to measure learning at the program scale. To address this need, we developed four freely available assessments-called Biology-Measuring Achievement and Progression in Science or Bio-MAPS-for general biology, molecular biology, ecology/evolution, and physiology programs. When administered at multiple time points in a curriculum, these instruments can provide departments with information on how student conceptual understanding changes across a major and help guide curricular modifications to enhance learning.

ID CYTOPLASMIC TAIL; REPLICATION
AB An authentic, hands-on experience in the laboratory is an important part of any undergraduate biology course. However, there are a limited number of mammalian virus systems that students can work with safely in an undergraduate teaching laboratory. For many systems, the risk to the students is too high. The influenza A virus M2 protein trans-complementation system bridges this gap. This system consists of a virus with mutations that prevent the expression of the essential M2 protein; therefore this virus can only replicate in a cell line that provides M2 in trans. Here, we describe the use of this system to carry out hemagglutination, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, 50% tissue culture infectious dose, and plaque assays in an undergraduate lab setting.

AB Competencies approach is a strategy advised by academicians, international organizations with competence in education (e.g., UNESCO), and those related to veterinary medicine practice (e.g., OIE [World Organisation for Animal Health, formerly International Office of Epizootics] and PANVET [Pan-American Association for Veterinary Sciences]) to answer society's demands for professionals. In Latin American universities, important initiatives to adopt competencies approach were developed by Tuning America Latina and VINCULAENTORNO (project developed by several international institutions, including IESALC from UNESCO [International Institution for Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean] focused on the entailment of universities with their environment, to foster social and economic sustainable development) more than a decade ago. In Venezuela, renewed efforts concerning curricular revision were carried out by academicians, taking into account the recommendations made by peer reviewers, during the accreditation process with ARCU-SUR regarding veterinary programs. The present document explores curricular designs of immunology for veterinary students in different universities to determine common characteristics, in order to obtain valuable information for future curricular plans. Veterinary Immunology courses from 24 universities in six Latin-American countries were examined, searching for common content. Other curricular variables, e.g., instructional models, hours planned for theoretical and laboratory activities, educational credits, position in curricular trees, previous requirements, and implementation dates, were considered. The average +/- standard deviation of immunology issues studied among the universities was 31 +/- 7.9 of the 63 listed topics, and the similarity was 79.2% (n = 19 courses), but other significant differences and curricular variations were recorded. This article describes novel aspects of curricular facts of this biomedical area in Latin America; these results may be valuable to design future curricular planning and a unified and precise curriculum on veterinary courses.

AB The landscape of higher education has changed significantly in recent years with a concomitant shift in the classroom. Science courses have historically been content-driven with the need to cover content driving curricular and pedagogical choices. However, educators are recognizing that the curricular approaches of years past no longer provide adequate support for students. A classroom that centers relationships-both among students as well as teachers and students-is one that is better positioned to foster a sense of belonging, science identity, and student success. Furthermore, an educator who builds a professional community and prioritizes self-care is the one who is better equipped to adapt to the ever-changing needs of students. Emphasizing the human component of education creates a classroom where students and teachers feel seen and valued and the educational experience is enriched for all.

Here, we have designed a six-session inquiry-based laboratory (IBL) curriculum for an upper-level microbiology laboratory course that fully involves students in the scientific process using bacterial conjugation as the model system, including both online discussions and in-person laboratory sessions. The student learning objectives focus on the scientific method, experimental design, data analysis, bacterial conjugation mechanisms, and scientific communication. We hypothesized students would meet these learning objectives after completing this IBL and tracked student learning and surveyed students to provide an assessment of the structure of the IBL using pre- and post-IBL quizzes and the Laboratory Course Assessment Survey. Overall, our results show this IBL results in positive student learning gains.

ID RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) rapidly have become more common in biology laboratory courses. The effort to implement CUREs has stimulated attempts to differentiate CUREs from other types of laboratory teaching. The Laboratory Course Assessment Survey (LCAS) was developed to measure students' perceptions of how frequently they participate in activities related to iteration, discovery, broader relevance, and collaboration in their laboratory courses. The LCAS has been proposed as an instrument that can be used to define whether a laboratory course fits the criteria for a CURE or not. However, the threshold LCAS scores needed to define a course as a CURE are unclear. As a result, we examined variation in published LCAS scores among different laboratory course types. In addition, we examined the distribution of LCAS scores for students enrolled in our research-for-credit course. Overall, we found substantial variation in scores among CUREs and broad overlap among course types in scores related to all three scales measured by the LCAS. Furthermore, the mean LCAS scores for all course types fell within the main part of the distribution of scores for our mentored research students. These results suggest that the LCAS cannot be used to easily quantify whether a course is a CURE or not. We propose that the biology education community needs to move beyond trying to quantitatively identify whether a course is a CURE. Instead, we should use tools like the LCAS to investigate what students are actually doing in their laboratory courses and how those activities impact student outcomes.

AB Academic conferences are integral to the dissemination of novel research findings and discussion of pioneering ideas across all postsecondary disciplines. For some participants, these environments are spaces to develop new collaborations, research projects, and social bonds; however, for others, conferences can be a place of marginalization and outright hostility. To assess how diverse individuals experience conference spaces, we interpreted results from a conference climate survey filled out by 198 of 482 registrants of the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research (SABER) West 2021 conference. Analysis of the survey data was conducted by six biology education researchers, who in addition to raising conference participant voices, provide insights, and next steps whose implementation can promote greater participant equity, representation, and engagement in future science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education conferences specifically and potentially all academic conference spaces more broadly.

AB Biology laboratory courses with hands-on activities faced many challenges when switched to online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The transition back to in-person instruction presents an opportunity to redesign courses with greater student input. Undergraduates in an similar to 350-student laboratory course were surveyed about their preferences for online or in-person instruction of specific laboratory course components. We predicted that students who have taken a virtual laboratory course prefer keeping some of the components online. We also hypothesized that their preferences are affected by their experience with online-only or with both online and in-person instruction. The results showed that students would like to move the laboratory component and group meetings back to in-person instruction, even if they never experienced college-level in-person courses. Also, many components, including the lectures, exams, assignment submission, and office hours are preferred to be held online. Surprisingly, students who have only taken online courses would rather give group presentations in person, while those who experienced both online and in-person instruction were undecided. Group presentations were the only component where the preference of the two groups significantly differed. Self-assessed learning gains showed that students performed very well in both the online semesters and the in-person semesters. Therefore, the preferences measured in this study were likely developed based on students' future expectations and personal gains, and not only on their metacognitive decisions and academic performances. This study provides considerations for redesigning components of laboratory courses to be more student-centered after the pandemic.

AB The global spread of the novel coronavirus first reported in December 2019 led to drastic changes in the social and economic dynamics of everyday life. Nationwide, racial, gender, and geographic disparities in symptom severity, mortality, and access to health care evolved, which impacted stress and anxiety surrounding COVID-19. On university campuses, drastic shifts in learning environments occurred as universities shifted to remote instruction, which further impacted student mental health and anxiety. Our study aimed to understand how students from diverse backgrounds differ in their worry and stress surrounding COVID-19 upon return to hybrid or in-person classes during the Fall of 2020. Specifically, we addressed the differences in COVID-19 worry, stress response, and COVID-19-related food insecurity related to race/ethnicity (Indigenous American, Asian/Asian American, black/ African American, Latinx/Hispanic, white, or multiple races), gender (male, female, and gender expressive), and geographic origin (ranging from rural to large metropolitan areas) of undergraduate students attending a regional-serving R2 university, in the southeastern U.S. Overall, we found significance in worry, food insecurity, and stress responses with females and gender expressive individuals, along with Hispanic/Latinx, Asian/Asian American, and black/African American students. Additionally, students from large urban areas were more worried about contracting the virus compared to students from rural locations. However, we found fewer differences in self-reported COVID-related stress responses within these students. Our findings can highlight the disparities among students' worry based on gender, racial differences, and geographic origins, with potential implications for mental health of university students from diverse backgrounds. Our results support the inclusion of diverse voices in university decisioning making around the transition through the COVID-19 pandemic.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Challenges in integration of concepts persist among undergraduate biology students. The S core concepts (SCCs) of biology presented in Vision and Change provide a comprehensive, concept-based description of the knowledge of biology, summarized in five main biological scales and five overarching principles that dictate natural biological phenomena and processes. The goal of this study was to collect information on students' interpretations of three introductory biology topics, (i) aquaporins, (ii) aerobic respiration, and (iii) DNA transcription, while associating their knowledge of these topics with the 5CCs. During three separate exam review sessions, students of a conventional lecture-based introductory biology class were asked to provide short responses of how each of the SCCs related to the given class topic. An inductive coding analysis of student responses was performed to reveal the main connections students made between each of the three topics and the SCCs. We found that for some core concepts it was easier for students to draw connections to a simple topic, such as aquaporins, while for other core concepts it was easier to draw connections to a multistep phenomenon, such as aerobic respiration. Although student connections were simple associations between a CC and a class topic, exploratory studies such as this one can be an important step toward designing teaching practices that are aligned with Vision and Change recommendations and could advance student conceptual understanding and integration of biological knowledge.

AB Biology education research (BER) is a recently emerging field mainly focused on the learning and teaching of biology in postsecondary education. As BER continues to grow, exploring what goals, questions, and scholarship the field encompasses will provide an opportunity for the community to reflect on what new lines of inquiry could be pursued in the future. There have been top-down approaches at characterizing BER, such as aims and scope provided by professional societies or peer-reviewed journals, and literature analyses with evidence for current and historical research trends. However, there have not been previous attempts with a bottom-up approach at characterizing BER by directly surveying practitioners and scholars in the field. Here, we share survey results that asked participants at the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research (SABER) annual meeting what they perceive as current scholarship in BER as well as what areas of inquiry in the field that they would like to see pursued in the future. These survey responses provide us with information directly from BER practitioners and scholars, and we invite colleagues to reflect on how we can collectively and collaboratively continue to promote BER as a field.

ID EDUCATION; PODCASTS
AB The extreme academic and social disruption caused by COVID-19 in the spring and summer of 2020 led to the loss of many student internships. We report here our creation of a novel internship for students majoring in the biological sciences. Student interns worked together to systematically categorize multiple episodes of This Week in Microbiology (TWiM). They annotated episodes by labeling relevant ASM fundamental curricular guidelines and the microbiology techniques described in several podcast episodes. Interns worked together, which advanced their written and oral communication skills while improving their scientific thinking skills. Faculty then enhanced each annotation by adding short figure-reading exercises that can be used in a variety of educational settings to teach science literacy. When surveyed, students reported greater confidence in analyzing and interpreting results from a variety of microbiological methods, improved communication of fundamental microbiology concepts in written and oral form, and enhanced ability to collaborate with others. Combined, this digital internship provided a unique opportunity for students to develop critical technical and scientific thinking skills and generated useful open education resources for teaching general microbiology in the form of annotated podcasts.

TI Classification of Features across Five CURE Networks Reveals
   Opportunities to Improve Course Design, Instruction, and Equity

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are tools used to introduce students to authentic participation in science. Several specific CUREs have been shown to benefit students' interest and retention in the biological sciences. Nevertheless, CUREs vary greatly in terms of their context, methodology, and degree of research authenticity, so different types of CUREs may differently influence student outcomes. This programmatic diversity poses a challenge to educators who want to better understand which course components and features are reliably present in a CURE curriculum. To address these issues, we identified, catalogued, and classified 112 potential features of CUREs across the biosciences. To develop the list, we interviewed instructors experienced with teaching individual and large networked CUREs across a diversity of the biological disciplines, including: Squirrel-Net (field-based animal behavior), SEA-PHAGES (wet lab microbiology and computational microbiology), Tiny Earth (environmental and wet lab microbiology), PARE (environmental microbiology), and the Genomics Education Partnership (eukaryotic computational biology). Twenty-five interviewees contributed expert content in terms of CURE features and classification of those items into an organized list. The resulting list's categories encompasses student experiences with the following: (i) the scientific process; (ii) technical aspects of science; (iii) the professional development associated with research; and (iv) building scientific identity. The most striking insight was that CUREs vary widely in terms of which features they contain, since different CUREs will by necessity have different approaches to science and student involvement. We also identified several features commonly thought to be crucial to CUREs yet have ambiguous definitions. This ambiguity can potentially confound efforts to make CUREs research-authentic and aligned with the central goals of science. We disambiguate these terms and represent their varied meanings throughout the classification. We also provide instructor-friendly supplementary worksheets along with considerations for instructors interested in expanding their CURE course design, instruction, and equity.

AB Primary Scientific Literature (PSL) has been used in undergraduate classrooms as a way to engage students with the research process and to increase science literacy. Most curricula lack any formal training for undergraduates to critically read PSL even though most undergraduate science courses require students to engage with PSL at some level. In addition, there are limited studies exploring the process by which expertise in reading PSL develops in undergraduates. In this study, we adapted behaviors that expert and novice PSL readers exhibit into a quantitative assessment tool, the PSL Reading Strategies Assessment, to evaluate undergraduates' development of reading strategies when learning to read PSL. Factor analysis and reliability measures were implemented to determine the structure of our assessment tool. Our results show the PSL Reading Strategies Assessment is sensitive enough to measure differences among student populations, suggesting that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to guide instructors and researchers as they change curricula, implement new teaching strategies, and strive to develop students' science literacy. Moreover, our data show that developing expert-like reading strategies in students learning to read PSL is not easy. Simply reading a PDF does little to promote the development of reading strategies in students learning to read PSL.

   curriculum; arts and sciences; teaching collaboration
AB Evidence-based studies on the benefits of integrating STEM into the arts are limited; however, some suggest that it can lead to improved scientific literacy and new approaches for artistic scholarship. Unfortunately, undergraduate education often creates disciplinary silos where the two are not integrated. Here, we discuss a unique collaboration between professors in the art and biology departments. Our goal was to integrate science into art courses using an agar art activity. We hypothesized that art students could effectively learn microbiology laboratory techniques and use them as novel tools for artistic practice. The activity was integrated into two to four sessions of introductory and advanced art courses over four semesters. After learning aseptic technique to culture bacteria, the students were supplied with a variety of media and bacterial strains and tasked with recreating a famous artist's drawing or using their own artistic concept. Student learning was assessed using a rubric to evaluate their art and demonstrate that the learning outcomes were met. Improvement in aesthetic, conception, and technical proficiency in handling the bacteria were demonstrated when comparing their first attempt at creating agar art to their second. Advanced art students earned higher scores than introductory students; however, the average scores for all students were "proficient" or above suggesting that the learning outcomes were met. The art was externally evaluated through American Society for Microbiology's (ASM's) Agar Art Contest and each time, at least one of our student artworks was chosen as a finalist for the People's Choice Award, providing validation of the success of our collaboration.

AB As educators, we should not assume that students are progressing toward intended STEM careers simply because they have persisted and received a STEM degree. In addition to learning biology content and scientific skills, students need guidance in making optimal career choices. In this study, we present seven career development modules designed specifically to motivate students to consider their successes as scientists and to consider applying their biological knowledge and scientific skills to a range of biology careers. These modules highlight the value and the utility of a biology degree and are, therefore, designed to increase students' self-confidence as well as their science and biology identities. The career development modules presented here are easy to implement and, in our experience, encourage engagement and class discussions. Our analyses confirm that these modules collectively increase student science and biology identities, two predictors for entry into STEM careers.

AB Conceptual teaching relies on concepts in conjunction with a bigger conceptual category (or categories). Revealing and using conceptual conjunctions in the science classroom means teaching conceptually. To make conceptual teaching more accessible to biology instructors, a three-concept model was described to be used during a lecture. This model has allowed the author to develop a relatively simple method that starts with an active concept or concepts, then introduces conjunctional and supporting concepts to relate the content to other concepts and relevant real-world applications. This method is intended to help instructors in preparing to teach biological concepts conceptually, in order to foster an enduring understanding of biological principles in their students.

TI Cutting-Edge Microscopy Systems as Remote Teaching and Research Tools
   for Undergraduate Students
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Whether due to illness, weather, safety, or other concerns, it is very difficult for biology students to gather meaningful and timely data without access to campus. This has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which most laboratory exercises have been conducted as a simulation. Simulated experiments provide a stopgap for certain courses, but for upper-level and research courses, they are often insufficient. Many new microscopy tools now on the market can be adapted to allow students to generate and analyze novel data with little aid of instructors. Remote brightfield-based systems like the CytoSMART Lux2 can be used to gathering real-time insight into the progression of cell growth, cell migration, and cell viability over time. The data from these systems can be viewed via the Internet or downloaded for later analysis. Confocal microscopy also offers unique remote learning opportunities. Because these fluorescence-based microscopes are controlled almost exclusively by a computer, free "remote desktop" software can allow students to learn how to use this cutting-edge technology and can also allow for the generation and analysis of novel data. While these systems can be expensive, they offer a variety of benefits for undergraduate students and researchers whether they are in the laboratory or working remotely.

ID EDUCATION
AB Strong communication skills are essential for future science professionals, but practical training has not been featured strongly in undergraduate curricula. To better train diverse life science majors in communication theory and skills, we created a foundational 200-level course and an advanced 400-level science communication course. Here, we outline the strategy, including lesson plans, assignments, and grading rubrics, for these courses. The science communication assignments presented are diverse in terms of audience, including communication to fellow scientists, to clinicians, and to the public, as well as in terms of format, including written, oral, and visual modes. We also provide suggestions for placing assignments designed to build upon each other into preexisting courses in a scaffolded manner to promote mastery of science communication skills.

TI An Online Interactive Video Vignette that Helps Students Learn Key
   Concepts of Fermentation and Respiration
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Topics related to energy transformation and metabolism are important parts of an undergraduate biology curriculum, but these are also topics that students traditionally struggle with. To address this, we have created a short online Interactive Video Vignette (IVV) called To Ferment or Not to Ferment: That is the Question. This IVV is designed to help students learn important ideas related to cellular respiration and metabolism. Students in various courses across four institutions were assigned the IVV as an out-of-class preinstruction homework assignment. To test the effectiveness of this IVV on student learning, we collected and analyzed data from questions embedded in the IVV, open response reflection questions, and pre- and postassessments from IVV watchers and nonwatchers. Our analysis revealed that students who completed the IVV activity interacted productively with this online tool and made significant learning gains on important topics related to cellular respiration and metabolism. This IVV is freely available via https://www.rit.edu/cos/interactive/MINT for instructors to adopt for class use.

TI A Scalable CURE Using a CRISPR/Cas9 Fluorescent Protein Knock-In
   Strategy in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology has advanced from the lab bench to clinical application with multiple trials underway. This article introduces a course-based undergraduate experience (CURE) combining CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (using a modified two-plasmid system) and the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans. This CURE is designed to be a scalable, semester-long laboratory that will introduce the students to literature searches, molecular biology, experiment planning, microscopy, CRISPR bioethics discussion, and scientific writing. Here, students challenged themselves to endogenously tag the C. elegans gene zmp-4, a matrix metalloproteinase enzyme, with a fluorescent protein marker and successfully generated a new worm strain. The knock-in was confirmed with genotyping and imaging and will be available for use by the entire worm community.

AB The rapid development of space technologies and the increase of human presence in space has brought the discussion of the effects of microgravity on cells into the undergraduate classroom. This paper proposes an idea to simulate microgravity on a bacterial culture, suitable for an introductory microbiology laboratory. For this purpose, we show the use of a 2D clinostat designed for microbial studies, along with traditional microbiology techniques such as optical density, plate counts, and biofilm biomass measurement to test the effect of simulated microgravity on the growth of Escherichia coli K12. This exercise aims to facilitate further discussions on the effects of microgravity on bacteria growth and communication, as well as the use of technology to simulate space and predict physiological changes in cells.
