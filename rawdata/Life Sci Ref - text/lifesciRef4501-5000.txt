AB Active learning increases performance in STEM courses, but many instructors are hesitant to adopt active-learning practices because they are afraid students will have negative attitudes toward them. It was hypothesized that students whose first college biology experience was in a course that used active learning would have more positive attitudes toward active learning than students who initially experienced a traditional lecture-based course. Students in an introductory Cell Biology course were queried regarding their attitudes toward active-learning practices used in the class. Responses to a Likert-scale survey indicated that students had positive attitudes toward active learning, and an analysis of variance indicated that there were no significant differences between the attitudes of students who had previously taken a lecture-based biology course at the same institution, students who had previously taken a biology course at another institution, and students who were enrolled in Cell Biology as their first college biology experience (n = 52, P = 0.530). Students strongly favored active-learning techniques over passive techniques but were less convinced of their learning benefits. Experienced students indicated that they preferred the teaching methods used in Cell Biology over the techniques used in their prior biology course. The results indicate that in the context of a small classroom setting, most students have positive attitudes toward active learning regardless of their prior biology lecture experiences.

TI Mendel or Molecules First: What is the Best Approach for Teaching

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

ID BIOLOGY MAJORS
AB A key question in teaching a General Genetics course is whether to present the major concepts of Mendelian genetics first, or to start with the essential ideas of molecular genetics. A comparison of two sequential courses at Creighton University with similar groups of students indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in exam scores or final grades with the two approaches. It thus may be better to focus on the questions of how best to present the material in each area to contemporary students and how better to prepare them to take exams that involve different types of questions requiring analytical, numerical, and writing skills. These issues are discussed in the context of the modern biology curriculum.

AB Arts-related science activities provide unique opportunities to engage students' strengths and motivate different types of learners (Jolly, 2014). Incorporating arts into the discussion of gene expression and microbiology introduces students to a multidisciplinary approach to STEM and provides an opportunity to explore the use of science in different fields such as design, art, and industry. In this protocol extension students create living works of art on agar plates by "painting" with E. coli that express fluorescent proteins of various colors.

AB The tree of life provides a fundamental roadmap to understanding biodiversity, yet requires integration across scales of the biological hierarchy and a unique set of tree thinking skills. This combination can be challenging for undergraduates at the introductory level because of their preconceptions regarding distinct fields of biology compounded by the unique structure of phylogenetic trees. To address these two challenges while providing an undergraduate research opportunity, we developed an activity for introductory biology students that integrates molecular, organismal, and evolutionary biology. This activity relies on woody plant identification, comparative morphology, and DNA sequence analysis to teach students how to reconstruct and interpret phylogenetic trees. After building separate phylogenetic hypotheses using morphological characters and molecular data, they compare their results with a master Tree of Trees to identify instances of homology and homoplasy. After delivering this activity, the majority of students scored the activity as "helpful to very helpful" in increasing their understanding of these concepts. Overall, we deliver a framework for developing comparable Tree of Trees-type activities that leverage students' interests in familiar organisms and requires them to span scales of the biological hierarchy while improving their tree thinking skills.

ID EDUCATION
AB Team-based learning (TBL) is structured, cooperative learning teaching strategy used in a variety of disciplines. TBL uses a three-step approach for delivering content to students: out-of-class preparation, readiness assurance, and application. In this article, a method for incorporating TBL into an undergraduate cell biology course using cystic fibrosis (CF) as a theme is described. Class content is divided into modules. Each module consists of (1) out-of-class video viewing and reading assignments; (2) individual and team assessments, mini-lectures, and think-pair-share activities to assess understanding of the material; and (3) in-class, group problem sets related to the molecular pathogenesis of CF. Although originally designed for an introductory undergraduate cell biology course, this curriculum can be easily adapted for upper-level undergraduate and high school students.

ID ATTITUDES
AB Teaching scientific inquiry in large interdisciplinary classes is a challenge. We describe a creative problem-based learning approach, using a motivational island crisis scenario, to inspire research design. Students were empowered to formulate their individual scientific inquiry and then guided to develop a testable hypothesis, aims, and objectives in designing a research proposal. Personalized data sets matched to the research objectives were provided to individual students for analysis and presentation. This technique helps students to gain critical insights into the global value of interdisciplinary collaboration toward solving complex real-world problems. Students learn the front end of research, how to formulate a line of scientific inquiry and design an innovative research project-both important skills for them as tomorrow's leaders and entrepreneurs.

TI How Does Evolution Explain Blindness in Cavefish?
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE blindness; evolution; inheritance
ID REGRESSIVE EVOLUTION; NATURAL-SELECTION; CONCEPTIONS; EYE
AB Commonly used evolution assessments often ask about the evolution of blindness in cavefish or salamanders, running speed in cheetahs, and/or the long necks of giraffes. Explaining the loss of function in cave animals, however, is more difficult than explaining evolution involving gains of function resulting from natural selection. In fact, the evolution of cavefish blindness is not yet well understood by scientists. This article presents the three current hypotheses for explaining the evolution of blindness in Mexican tetras (Astyanax mexicanus), related to the Next Generation Science Standards and the Advanced Placement curriculum.

   respiration; DNA replication; central dogma
ID INTRODUCTORY BIOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; PEER
AB Students often struggle to understand the complex molecular systems and processes presented in introductory biology courses. These include the Calvin cycle, the Krebs cycle, transcription and translation, and DNA replication, among others. Traditionally, these systems and processes are taught using textbook readings and PowerPoint slides as lecture aids; video animations have also become popular in recent years. Students tend to be passive observers in many of these methods of instruction, relying heavily on "memorization" learning techniques. To address this, I developed an active-learning intervention called "molecular sculpting" in which students construct two-dimensional or three-dimensional versions of an assigned molecular system or process, complete with representations of proteins, chromosomes, electrons, protons, and other molecules (depending on the system). The value of this learning activity was measured in five class sessions in an introductory biology course during the 2014-2015 academic year. Pre- and post-class written assignments showed that students were often able to describe course concepts more completely after sessions in which sculpting was used, compared with sessions without sculpting. Molecular sculpting is a unique, hands-on activity that appears to have significant learning gains associated with it; it can be adapted for use in a variety of K-14 biology courses.

AB Nationwide science classes, from elementary through secondary, are placing a larger emphasis on inquiry and authentic experiences. The opportunity for community members (students, teachers, or interested individuals) to collect real data and contribute to a research project is the definition of citizen science. Recent disease outbreaks of mosquito-transmitted pathogens (West Nile, eastern equine encephalitis, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika) demonstrate the need to educate children and adults about the public health risks posed by mosquitoes. This lesson plan has students determine mosquito species and subsequent disease risk around their house and in their community by collecting mosquito eggs and rearing a portion of them to adults. The students identify adult mosquitoes and associated health risks. Furthermore, students and teachers have the option to participate in a national mosquito-species-distribution study by submitting mosquito eggs and adults to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The data generated by participant submissions will be available to all mosquito submitters, making each student and school part of a larger project. This lesson plan has three objectives beyond the citizen science experience: (1) clarify the individual's role in protecting individuals, communities, and pets from illness; (2) raise awareness of pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes; and (3) participate in a national program to gather mosquito distribution data. The lesson and the associated supplementary material (available at http://www.citizenscience.us) can be used for middle to high school classes, as well as Advanced Placement classes, because the materials and presentations can be easily modified to classroom needs.

To keep students engaged, I have developed a small set of teaching animations using PowerPoint and Camtasia Studio software packages. A survey of students who learned four difficult topics with traditional written lessons and with these animations revealed that 80% of the students say that they learn better when animations are included. With such a majority reporting that cartoons engage them in learning, I wanted to share my simple method of creating them with the teaching community.

AB It has been noted that undergraduate project-based laboratories lead to increased interest in scientific research and student understanding of biological concepts. We created a novel, inquiry-based, multiweek genetics research project studying Ptpmeg, for the Introductory Biology Laboratory course at Brandeis University. Ptpmeg is a protein involved in axon formation in Drosophila melanogaster. In order to better understand Ptpmeg's functionality, students sought to find Ptpmeg's enhancers and suppressors by engaging in either a 4- or a 7-week modular research project. By the end of the semester, students were able to learn various laboratory techniques and acquire a deeper understanding of Drosophila genetics in both versions of the course.

ID SCIENCE; TEXTBOOKS
AB An essential element of science instruction is content literacy. In order to improve literacy specific to science, vocabulary must be addressed. As Jitendra et al. (2004) pointed out, "because learning vocabulary during independent reading is very inefficient for students with reading difficulties, vocabulary and word learning skills must be taught." We provide a summary of an investigation to improve the technology-based vocabulary of students with learning disabilities in a freshman high school biology class. The procedures for the project are provided, along with lessons learned about vocabulary instruction of students with disabilities.

AB Biology textbooks tend to assert the correctness of evolutionary concepts but mention very little of the evidence that supports them. This gives the impression that evolutionary theory is poorly supported, which discourages acceptance of the theory. A case in point is the age of the Earth. Biology textbooks usually mention that the planet is similar to 4.6 billion years old but neither tell how that was determined nor give evidence that the method (radiometric dating) is reliable. Students are therefore given insufficient reason to doubt that the Earth is any older than the 6000 years that the Genesis account suggests. Here, therefore, I review the evidence for an old Earth, to provide a concise but thorough reference for teachers who wish to supplement the meager information in textbooks with further details. Earth's age is relevant to biology because an old Earth is necessary for macro-evolution to occur and also because some dating methods (e.g., dendrochronology, varves) use materials of biological origin.

TI Chromosome Connections: Compelling Clues to Common Ancestry
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Hominid chromosomes; common ancestry; DNA fusion; hypotheses tested
ID FUSION; ORIGIN
AB Students compare banding patterns on hominid chromosomes and see striking evidence of their common ancestry. To test this, human chromosome no. 2 is matched with two shorter chimpanzee chromosomes, leading to the hypothesis that human chromosome 2 resulted from the fusion of the two shorter chromosomes. Students test that hypothesis by looking for (and finding) DNA evidence of telomere segments at the fusion site, thus reinforcing the likelihood of our common ancestry with chimps and showing that we all carry the molecular fossils of telomere fusion! Students see how multiple lines of evidence make a compelling case for common ancestry.

AB Scientists researching biological control should engage in education because translating research programs into classroom activities is a pathway to increase scientific literacy among students. Classroom activities focused on biological control target all levels of biological organization and can be cross-disciplinary by drawing from subject areas such as ecology, molecular biology, physiology, and chemistry. We evaluate published "how-to" biological-control activities to determine whether they meet National Science Education Standards and use a constructivist pedagogical approach. We also provide an example classroom activity developed from our research that scientists can use as a template to develop their science-education activities.

TI Education's Missing Link: How Private School Teachers Approach Evolution
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DE Teaching evolution; Lutheran secondary schools
ID BIOLOGY TEACHERS; CREATIONISM; STANDARDS
AB Over 5 million students and 28,000 schools are consistently marginalized or left out of statistics that describe evolution and science education. Although they are relatively few in number compared with their public school counterparts, the millions of students and hundreds of thousands of teachers in private schools need to be counted in research about teaching and learning in the biology classroom. Assumptions have been made about how teachers in these often religious schools teach evolution, but do we have verifiable data? Could teachers in these schools be similar to those in public schools in their teaching of evolution, or is there a silent undercurrent that has not been detected? It is the purpose of this study to reveal more about this underrepresented segment of the population of science teachers.

AB The structure and function of the cell is one of the essential topics in the biology classroom because it is one of the foundations for studying other topics in biology. Monocelly is a digital board game designed to help high school students identify and understand the structure and function of cells and the various organelles within them. This game was developed using Google Sheets to be easy to use and can even be modified by the teacher as needed to help students learn other materials using game-based learning designs.

DE flipped classroom model; inquiry-based learning; 5E instructional model;
   science practices; animal adaptation; natural selection
AB Nontraditional teaching modalities have become the new normal, where hybrid and online education are bound to become an integral component of education at all levels. This paper suggests the coupling of the flipped classroom model with the 5E instructional model for students to develop science understandings and practices in a hybrid and online environment. We demonstrate our model through a middle school unit on animal adaptation and natural selection. In our model, the teacher involves students with asynchronous online activities that raise students' curiosity and help them develop the concepts before the face-to-face or synchronous class activities. The complementary interactive online asynchronous and face-to-face or synchronous activities aim to promote critical thinking and communication on one hand and NGSS Core Ideas and Science Practices on the other. This paper concludes that science teachers can benefit from this model to engage students in inquiry-based activities in both hybrid or remote learning.

AB Teachers ate eager for professional development on teaching evolution, especially if it includes direct ties to relevant curricula and detailed lesson plans. Howard Hughes Medical Instituters BioInteractive Online Professional Learning: Evolution course was developed to provide educators with free, in-depth, multimedia resources that highlight important scientific concepts and studies in evolution and engage participants through interactive activities that link to student resources. Our goals in the development of the asynchronous, nonfacilitated course were to (I) deepen teachers' content knowledge of evolutionary concepts essential to NGSS and AP Biology courses, (2) increase teachers' confidence and comfort in teaching evolution content to general biology and AP Biology students, (3) have teachers identify major evolutionary concepts in scientific studies, authentic data, or educational media used to teach evolution, and (4) assist teachers in identifying and incorporating relevant Biolnteractive resources to illustrate evolutionary content and science practices in their own course(s). Our results from a postcourse survey that included prepost retrospective confidence questions suggest that the course improved educators' knowledge in evolution and their confidence in teaching evolutionary topics. Overall, this course provides educators the opportunity to deepen their content knowledge and obtain exciting, relevant, and reliable resources to use in their classrooms.

ID GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; STUDENTS UNDERSTANDINGS; TRANSFORMATION
AB The Central Dogma is a crucial concept needed to understand biotechnology and molecular biology. High school students often struggle with a meaningful understanding of this abstract concept. This paper presents an inquiry-based approach to increase critical thinking and understanding of the Central Dogma. Commonly used in high school classrooms is Bio-Rad pGLO plasmid containing green fluorescent protein (GFP), because of its accessibility and the fluorescence it emits when exposed to ultraviolet light. We use the expression of GFP in a high school hands-on class project so that students can visualize and understand the abstract concepts of the Central Dogma. Students will also explore protein structure and its importance for a functional protein. During the entire project, students will be guided by the instructor to build hypotheses and design experiments to test those hypotheses, exercising the scientific method.

DT Article
DE biology; evolution; science practices; NGSS; argumentation; high school
AB Arguing from evidence is one of eight key science practices in which students should engage. It is an essential component of science, yet students have difficulties with this practice. We describe a scaffolded claimsevidence-reasoning (CER) argumentation framework that is embedded within a new eight-week, freely available curriculum unit developed by the Genetic Science Learning Center - Evolution: DNA and the Unity of Life. The scaffold provides high school students with practice in both developing and evaluating written arguments. It is designed to incrementally build student skill week-by-week, starting with an introduction to the CER components of an argument, and ending with students evaluating data and constructing a supported written argument. We also present evaluation findings from field testing the argumentation scaffold in the context of the complete Evolution unit in dozens of classrooms. And we discuss how this integrated, scaffolded approach to argumentation influenced both student and teacher learning.

   Generation Science Standards; NGSS; curriculum design; scientific
   process
AB Model-based inquiry, inquiry-based learning, and phenomenon are all popular terms in K-12 science education right now. Science education in our public education system is rapidly changing due to the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). These standards ask teachers to move away from direct instruction to having students develop their understanding of the natural world through guided-learning activities. Under NGSS, students are expected to develop this understanding through one of the main scientific practices, model building, which requires a complex, real-world phenomenon to drive the learning experience. Phenomena work best in the classroom when they apply to students' lives and pique their interest. Finding such phenomena can be hard - especially finding ones that have not already been thoroughly explained on the internet. A great way to find a complex, real-world phenomenon that will interest students is to partner with a local research lab to bring part of their research project into the classroom. This article lays out a process for bringing a local research project into the classroom and designing NGSS-aligned curricula around this project to create a more authentic learning experience for high school students.

AB The purpose of the proposed lesson is to help students develop media literacy skills, which are necessary across the curriculum and in students' everyday lives. Students will do so by evaluating a provided conspiracy theory and, later, a pseudoscience claim (alternatively, students may supply either material). In order to thoroughly evaluate the claim, students will generate and answer media literacy questions, with instructor or peer support as needed. Once students have practiced using the media literacy questions to evaluate the conspiracy theory, they will progress to more challenging material, such as a pseudoscience claim about a fad diet. Finally, the instructor may choose to extend the lesson to allow students time to apply their media literacy skills to a curricular pseudoscience claim, perhaps regarding climate change or the efficacy of vaccines. To complete the lesson, students will reflect on the content of the claims, why the misinformation matters, and the process of evaluating the material to draw appropriate conclusions.

AB We designed and implemented two instructional approaches to plant education, with the intention of supporting positive attitudes toward plants among sixth-grade students (11-13 years old). In one instructional approach, students prepared a book about plants that have interesting characteristics. In the other approach, students visited a botanical garden. The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of these approaches on students' attitudes toward plants. A matched-pairs experimental design was used in the research. A total of 56 students (28 in each group) participated in the study. Data were gathered by using the Plant Attitude Questionnaire. This instrument consisted of 28 items using a five-point Likert scale and included four dimensions of attitudes toward plants: importance, urban trees, interest, and utilization. Our results indicate that instruction via writing a book about plants with interesting characteristics is a good way to support students' positive attitudes toward plants; this approach was especially effective in the dimensions of interest and utilization. The botanical garden trip was also effective, though in a more limited way, in supporting students' positive attitudes toward plants; this approach was most effective in the dimension of urban trees.

AB Starch granules in fresh and processed foods are routinely identified by a variety of chemical and microscopic methods. In the teaching laboratory, the use of cross-polarized light in a microscope (monocular or binocular) quickly demonstrates the presence of starch granules by their characteristic birefringence, often called a Maltese cross. In the present study, we first identified raw potato starch granules by their birefringence, followed by three overlapping chemical methods to confirm the presence (or absence) of starch. First, Lugol's iodine solution, a starch indicator, immediately stained the granules black. Second, amylase digested the small starch granules within 30-60 minutes. Third, glucose test strips demonstrated the presence of glucose that resulted from the enzymatic breakdown of starch granules by amylase. Fourth, we also confirmed that the starch granules were broken down by the enzyme amylase by observing the "digested" product under crossed polarization and noting the disappearance of the birefringent effect. Although the demonstration of starch has long been a staple in teaching laboratories, we have combined the optical and chemical demonstrations of starch for the same lab, with each serving as a confirmation for the other.

AB Statistical methods are indispensable to the practice of science. But statistical hypothesis testing can seem daunting, with P-values, null hypotheses, and the concept of statistical significance. This article explains the concepts associated with statistical hypothesis testing using the story of "the lady tasting tea," then walks the reader through an application of the independent-samples t-test using data from Peter and Rosemary Grant's investigations of Darwin's finches. Understanding how scientists use statistics is an important component of scientific literacy, and students should have opportunities to use statistical methods like this in their science classes.

AB While learner-centeredness is important to quantify, education researchers disagree on how best to measure it. The overall aim of this research was to measure the learner-centeredness of introductory biology classrooms with a valid and reliable instrument that offers a different perspective than self-reported faculty surveys or expert observation protocols - Palmer et al.'s (2014) syllabus scoring rubric. We investigated whether syllabus rubric scores aligned with both faculty self-reports and expert observations of learner-centeredness from the same classrooms, and whether these other metrics predict an instructor's total syllabus score better than instructor gender or years of teaching experience. Course syllabi from eight instructors who taught the same nonmajors biology course were scored independently using this syllabus scoring rubric. Our results suavest that syllabus learning objectives link to learner-centeredness and, interestingly, that other external metrics of learner-centeredness may predict syllabus rubric scores derived from Palmer et al.'s instrument.

ID SCIENCE
AB Scientific literacy is a complex topic that is often cited, but rarely fully defined. Teaching scientific literacy often focuses solely on scientific reading and writing. However, to be scientifically literate, one must also be able to distinguish between credible and non-credible sources of information. Such ability involves a thorough knowledge of referencing and the peer-review process. To incorporate such issues into the teaching of a specific aspect of scientific literacy, a two-part module was developed with one module focusing on each of the aforementioned topics. Pre-tests and post-tests assessed the efficacy of within-module assignments in terms of increasing student knowledge and confidence in understanding scientific literacy. Following completion of the modules, students were involved in a project that required the writing a scientific paper. Statistically significant gains were observed in student confidence after student completion of the module-specific assignments. Similar findings occurred in knowledge of basic formatting and peer-review after completion of the written paper. The timing in which gains occurred suggests that procedural learning occurred prior to declarative learning. Thus, a multistep process appears effective in explaining a complex topic such as scientific literacy to undergraduate students.

ID TETRAHYMENA
AB The centrifuge is an important piece of equipment for any biology lab, necessary for a wide variety of experiments. Cost, however, often prevents the use of centrifuges in many teaching labs, greatly limiting educational experiences for students. As a result, we describe how to construct a "homemade" single-speed mini-centrifuge using inexpensive parts easily acquired online or at hardware or other stores (e.g., a 4.7-quart plastic bowl and lid, standard computer cooling fan, AC/DC adapter, electrical wire, etc.). We further used this design and a commercial mini-centrifuge to pellet 1-mL samples of Tetrahymena thermophila, and we found that the two performed comparably. Finally, because our plans and the materials needed to build this device are all open source, we call our design the OPN Minifuge, and we hope that it will help to expand the scope of experiments that students can run in introductory and upper-level biology teaching labs.

AB The interdependency of relationships and energy flow in ecosystems are crucial biological concepts that students frequently find hard to understand. They are one of the foundations to the survival of living things and the complex processes that balance life on Earth. The ability to interpret food chains and food webs is fundamental in the communication and understanding of relationships between organisms in the domain of biology. I examine the ways elementary-level students read a simple food web diagram and the effect this has on their understanding of the encapsulated biology concepts. Diagram reading approaches are described along with analysis of how meaning making is influenced by students' preconceived ideas. The results indicate the students experienced a range of difficulties in reading the food web diagram. I conclude that food web instruction must address prior knowledge, challenge preconceptions, and involve deep diagram processing. The research provides insights into the difficulties high school students have in comprehending food webs and understanding relationships in ecosystems.

ID CLASSROOM; EVOLUTION
AB Biology teachers inevitably struggle with how best to teach evolution. Students arrive in their classrooms with preconceptions, many of which are overwhelmingly skeptical, and science teachers are increasingly being pressured to adhere to an arbitrary degree of objectivity that makes discussing scientific worldviews challenging. These challenges have resulted in evolution being taught largely as a series of explanations for questions arising from observations of the living world. In so doing, students may not have a chance to grapple with the worldview that produced those explanations, or develop a more mechanistic intuition for inheritance and change in the world they see around themselves. Here we put forth all the tools necessary for a class to build a simulation of an evolving population experiencing natural selection from scratch in a Google Docs spreadsheet. Not only will this activity help students experiment with the natural world more mechanistically, but it will also allow them to learn as actual evolutionary biologists do.

DE Natural history; identification tests; ringer
AB To encourage greater depths of both processing and retrieval by students during testing, the authors inserted one new, unfamiliar plant (i.e., a "ringer") into the pool of samples assembled for each plant-identification quiz. Each ringer was chosen to be superficially similar to - and yet distinctively different from - a plant species covered earlier in the course. The addition of the ringer made the tests both more authentic and more valuable by training students to look beyond the superficial details and make substantive, evidence-based identifications.

ID HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY
AB The interdependence of living organisms and related ecology concepts are often difficult for students to grasp if they only study them from textbooks. To really understand how habitat fragmentation affects biodiversity, it is best to allow students to study it in the field. In the activities described here, I used inquiry as a basis for experiential learning. Focusing on two natural areas of unequal size, students investigated the areas to assess arthropod species richness and examine whether it was correlated with the size of the area. By establishing 10 daily observation periods and identifying arthropods in each session, students observed firsthand the relationship of species richness to biodiversity and that the size of the natural area was not significant. This translated to a greater understanding of biodiversity and its role in the relationships of living organisms in a local ecosystem. Students also gained valuable insight into how scientific studies are conducted.

AB The term frequency dependence describes scenarios in which the likelihood of an event occurring is strongly tied to how common a particular trait is. Understanding frequency dependence is key to understanding numerous biological processes relevant to evolution by natural selection, such as predation, mimicry, disease, and effective vaccinations. We use dodgeball to demonstrate frequency dependent selection in a hypothetical predator-prey community, and provide possible extensions into other topics. This activity can be used with biology students in high school through upper-level undergraduate courses.

DE Taste; genetics; nutrition; public health
ID TASTE PREFERENCES; ACCEPTANCE; BITTERNESS; CHILDREN
AB Research into human eating behavior is complex. Innate preferences for sweet and aversions to bitter tastes may explain why we choose certain foods. Some segments of the population, called "supertasters," are more sensitive to bittertasting foods because of a genetic polymorphism. These individuals may reject bitter vegetables like broccoli, potentially putting them at risk for obesity and chronic disease. However, learned associations with food, including rewards, social experiences, and modeling, have also been shown to explain food choice. The respective roles of taste and learning in food choice are explored here in a classroom investigation designed for undergraduates.

ID MICROORGANISMS
AB Diverse communities of arthropods and microbes provide humans with essential ecosystem goods and services. Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant macroscopic animals on the planet, and many remain to be discovered. Much less is known about microbial diversity, despite their importance as free-living - species and as symbionts. We created "Bugs on Bugs" as an inquiry-based research project in which students investigate both arthropod and microbe diversity by - collecting arthropods and culturing their symbionts. "Bugs on Bugs" was developed as a multiple-course project in which students from different disciplines specialize in parts of the project and collaborate in project design and data analysis. We provide instructions for use of "Bugs on Bugs" in active-learning courses, share experiences in which a biodiversity course and a microbiology course completed "Bugs on Bugs" together at our institution, and share suggestions for implementation based on our experiences.

DE 3D printing; student engagement; project creation; professional skills
AB Student engagement during the development of a three-dimensional visual aid or teaching model can vary for a number of reasons. Some students report that they are not "creative" or "good at art," often as an excuse to justify less professional outcomes. Student engagement can be low when using traditional methods to produce a model, but 3D printing gives both the teacher and the student new ways of experiencing classroom activities. The simple (and free) software offers students valuable skills, "professional" modeling results, a stronger understanding of the topic at hand, and new confidence.

DE Guided inquiry; laboratory; statistics; tree rings; undergraduate
AB Undergraduate biology labs often explore the techniques of data collection but neglect the statistical framework necessary to express findings. Students can be confused about how to use their statistical knowledge to address specific biological questions. Growth in the area of observational ecology requires that students gain experience in sampling design and the scope of inference relevant to observational studies. I developed a laboratory-based guided inquiry that illustrates these concepts by comparing ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees in northeastern Washington State. This approach presents a hands-on experience whereby students apply the statistics they learn in the classroom to a field-based investigation, giving students an appreciation of the design and interpretation of observational studies in ecology.

AB Research shows the importance of active learning, especially within science classes. One way to achieve this goal is to incorporate student-driven projects into the course (e.g., posters). Traditionally, science-poster assignments follow the spirit of the science fair in which a student conducts an experiment and analyzes the results. This article offers an alternative take on science posters: position posters, another way to get students engaged. Students pick their own topic and then present the scientific evidence for their topics and come to a conclusion of their own. Choosing their own topics encourages them to become more invested in the process of completing the poster, and overall, students enjoy the learning process.

AB Pioneering Mars: Turning the Red Planet Green with the Earth's Smallest Settlers (http://pioneeringmars.org) provides a partnership model for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning that brings university scientists together with high school students to investigate whether cyanobacteria from Antarctica could survive on Mars. Funded by NASA, and aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards, this work engages high school students in every aspect of the scientific method, culminating with students designing and implementing experiments in a university lab - experiments that will be replicated on board the International Space Station. Beyond the potential scientific breakthroughs it may produce, Pioneering Mars provides a STEM education model for project-based learning using university and school partnerships. Our team consists of a university marine science professor, a STEM education researcher, four high school science teachers, and 85 high-achieving students. The model can easily transfer to leaders and learners across the United States who will be able to replicate and extend this effort in their own educational settings.

DT Article
DE Evolution; SPORE; video game; teaching game; edutainment
AB The video game SPORE was found to hold characteristics that stimulate higher-order thinking even though it rated poorly for accurate science. Interested in evaluating whether a scientifically inaccurate video game could be used effectively, we exposed students to SPORE during an evolution course. Students that played the game reported that they spent an average of 3 hours more a week with class material; these same students also scored about 5% higher on examinations and in the course. Methods to use SPORE to teach evolution are included; to create a teaching community that uses this game might make this edutainment product an even more effective tool.

Students measure skull shape in fetal, infant, juvenile, and adult chimpanzees and compare them to adult skulls of Homo sapiens, Homo erectus, and Australopithecus afarensis. They conclude by re-interpreting their findings in light of Ardipithecus ramidus.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Editorial Material
DE Birth control; case study; decision making; active learning
AB Case studies generate active discussion and decision-making skills. This 50-minute case-study lesson teaches high school and undergraduate students about a fundamental and private aspect of their lives, birth control methods. Students direct their own learning by researching, teaching one another about, and making recommendations about the methods. Students are more likely to apply what they have learned to their own lives after being involved in and practicing decision-making skills during the cases. Because students openly discuss their ideas in relation to the cases, instructors can correct misconceptions about birth control without embarrassing students.

TI Using an Active-Learning Approach to Teach Epigenetics
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Editorial Material
DE Active learning; epigenetics; genetics education
AB Epigenetics involves heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. I developed an active-learning approach to convey this topic to students in a college genetics course. I posted a brief summary of the topic before class to stimulate exchange in cooperative groups. During class, we discussed the genotypic and phenotypic differences between monozygotic twins and the role of epigenetic mechanisms in these differences. I also presented the molecular mechanisms that lead to these epigenetic changes as well as techniques used to study them. Students were particularly interested in pondering the relationships between environmental interactions, epigenetic changes, and phenotypic consequences, including human behavior.

ID STUDENTS QUESTIONS
AB Large data sets invite students to engage in scientific practices such as question asking, identifying correlations, using visualizations, and practicing data literacy in an authentic context. However, authentic data sets are rarely introduced in the biology classroom. We prepared an online inquiry activity based on authentic gross characteristics of a gazelle data set. These included gazelle's weight, location (longitude and latitude), collection date, and measured lengths of body parts. In constructing the activity, we considered the following design principles: use of high-quality authentic data, choice of a wide data set to allow multiple research questions, and exposure of the participants to basic data science tools. The activity starts with an introduction to data sets and guided data analysis, and it ends with independent research of a large gazelle data set. The activity was experienced by 121 teachers and was found to promote higher-order research questions. Before the activity, most of the teachers' questions focused on gazelle properties-first-order questions, according to Dillon's (1984) classification of research questions. Following the activity, most questions belonged to the comparison and contingencies categories (second- and third-order questions, respectively). Thus, this activity might serve to expand the biology teacher's toolbox in teaching inquiry and data literacy.

ID ARGUMENTATION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Case studies are valuable tools for instruction but are often limited to a single topic and a single class period. Courses such as evolution that synthesize multiple concepts around a common theme, however, can use a single case study type project that extends over the entire semester to develop and link core concepts. A central theme in evolutionary biology is determining if complex biological traits represent adaptations that arose by natural selection. The instructional model presented here engages students in a step-by-step process to answer this question of adaptation for a trait of their choosing. In this process, the instructor first introduces the major concepts required to address adaptation. As each major concept is developed in class, students apply this concept to their particular trait, using information gathered from published studies. Students then report their research back to the class. At the end of the semester, each group synthesizes their evidence into a paper developing an argument as to whether or not their trait fits the criteria of being an adaptation. This project provides students with ownership of course material, gets students to act as practicing scientists, and helps them integrate and apply theoretical material to real questions.

DE CRISPR; de-extinction; DNA; gene editing; mammoth; protein synthesis
AB Scientific modeling is a practice that we use frequently in our undergraduate biomedical applications course for nonscience majors. We use case studies in which students apply course concepts to create cause-and-effect models. In this article, we describe a case study assessment on protein synthesis that examines the use of CRISPR to bring back the mammoth (i.e., de-extinction). Students learn about protein synthesis throughout the course and work on various case study scenarios to apply those concepts. Their final assessment is a team project to illustrate how protein synthesis is influenced by gene editing, including gene expression and its regulation, transcription, translation, protein structure and function, and the ultimate impact on an organism's phenotype. Although we use this case study as an assessment, it is also appropriate as a class activity in which students practice modeling the CRISPR gene-editing system.

AB Storytelling can stimulate learning by delivering scientific content within a narrative that increases comprehension and engagement. In this article I describe the coevolutionary arms race between toxic newts and predatory garter snakes. This engaging story centers on the use of a deadly neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX) as an antipredator defense. Some species of newts contain TTX in their tissues, but resistance to TTX has developed through convergent evolution in garter snakes and other species. TTX resistance results from mutated voltage-gated sodium channels. These channels, whether TTX resistant or not, are found in all animals and are vital to the function of nervous and muscle tissues. Through reciprocal selection, coevolution has created phenotypic matching between toxic newts and TTX-resistant garter snakes across their range in the western United States. In other words, as newts became more poisonous, garter snakes became more resistant. These results and the scientific process behind them are discussed in detail. This story can be used by educators to provide a unifying and engaging backdrop as students learn multiple aspects of biology, such as protein structure, genetics, phylogenetics, electrical signaling, evolution, and the process of science.

AB How genetic variation influences phenotypic variation is of importance to many biological disciplines, including evolutionary biology, biomedicine, and agriculture. Nevertheless, students frequently struggle to make connections across levels of biological organization, which can make it challenging to facilitate understanding of how nucleotide variation gives rise to organismal variation. At the same time, biology students are now expected to gain early experience with cornerstone techniques from molecular biology, so that these skills can be reinforced and expanded upon. Here we describe a five-to-seven-week sequencing project that examines genetic and phenotypic variation in wild-type and yellow-bodied fruit flies and, in the process, exposes students to several foundational techniques in molecular biology. In addition, students analyze partial yellow gene sequences from PCR products using the freely available bioinformatics suite UGENE and in doing so are introduced to core bioinformatics skills. The entire project is framed around the axiom that if the yellow gene controls phenotypic differences in body color between wild-type and yellow-bodied flies, it should be possible to identify causal variation in yellow sequences from wild-type versus yellow-bodied flies. This project relies on guided inquiry and can be used in 1000- or 2000-level molecular biology courses and advanced high school laboratories.

AB Through experience and surveying undergraduate microbiology curriculum, we found that most schools discuss biofilms in lecture classes but not laboratory courses. Biofilms are a concern for both industry and the medical field and should be studied in student laboratories. To study this at an institution, there would need to be an affordable method to assay them. As a sample specimen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as it proliferates into biofilms when it is starved for nutrients, which can be easily simulated in a laboratory environment. Known assays for studying biofilms are expensive, and most departments do not have the materials. In Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB), P. aeruginosa can also be induced to form a biofilm, but the technique is not seen very often because it has not been sufficiently standardized for undergraduate microbiology education laboratories. To account for the absence of specialized reagents, we incubated bacteria for longer periods of time as a means to diminish nutrients or starve the specimen. Using a two-tailed West, we were able to show that glass tubes inoculated with P. aeruginosa in TSB for 48 hours were forming distinct biofilms on the glass surface, which is appropriate for undergraduate microbiology laboratory studies.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) can have benefits for many students, especially those who lack access to traditional apprenticeships for research. As part of an effort to create more opportunities for students to have access to primary research and move away from traditional cookie-cutter labs, we have created a multicourse CURE spanning three undergraduate teaching labs in which students can pick and choose to take any of the courses that most interest them. This CURE explores the essential understanding of the entergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as high-throughput sequencing and mutagenesis screens. These low-cost modular labs are designed to be flexible and integrated into any single teaching lab to increase exposure to both fundamental lab skills and primary research.

AB The Board of Curiosity is an easy tool that allows students to ask anonymous questions and perform their own research. This tool was particularly effective in a group of adult learners, who commented that the board was a fun way to increase the breadth and depth of the course without derailing class time with tangents. Overall, this simple intervention helped foster a collaborative atmosphere of group accountability.

AB Recommendations for undergraduate biology education include integration of research experiences into the curriculum, regardless of major. While non-biology majors and biology majors differ in affective characteristics, it is not clear if they differ in their incoming science process skills. We created a scenario-based assessment instrument - designed to gauge science process skills - that was accessible to nonmajors and majors. We evaluated nonmajors' and majors' open-ended responses using a rubric. We also assessed students' science identity, confidence, and attitudes with a pre-course survey. While affective differences between the populations are evident, we did not detect meaningful differences in science competency. These findings indicate that nonmajors and majors are skilled in the process of science and have the ability to engage in meaningful scientific inquiry, confirming our hypothesis that, in supporting a scientifically literate citizenry, educators must emphasize teaching strategies that target affective differences between nonmajors and majors.

AB One of the goals of the Science Mutation Against Drug Abuse Partnership (SEADAP) is to increase student knowledge about drugs through the implementation of an inquiry-based curriculum. A science teacher who was a participant in the SEADAP program served as a facilitator for middle school students participating in an after-school program to assist them with designing their own experiment using planarians (flatworms) exposed to caffeine, sugar, and an energy drink. Results indicated that the average velocity of the planarians in 1 mM caffeine, 1 mM sucrose, and 0.1% Monster Energy drink increased in comparison to their behavior in spring water. The students also learned that substances such as energy drinks can be lethal to planarians.

TI The Misuse of Genetics: The Dihybrid Cross & the Threat of "Race
   Crossing"
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Mendelian genetics; eugenics; race; history of biology
AB Biology teachers consider basic Mendelian genetics to be value-free, objective science, immune to misinterpretation and misuse. It may thus come as a surprise to learn that in the early days of genetics a cornerstone of genetics education, the dihybrid cross, was employed to support claims of the racial superiority of whites over blacks and to provide a "scientific" rationale for laws prohibiting interracial marriages. In 1917 the prominent eugenicist Charles B. Davenport warned of the danger of "disharmonious combinations" of physical and behavioral traits in the second generation of "wide race crosses," equivalent to the F-2 generation of a dihybrid cross. He tried and failed to find data to support his arguments in a study of the mixed-race inhabitants of Jamaica. Davenport's analysis was deeply flawed, especially by the racist assumptions underlying this work. Although these events occurred a century ago, biology teachers may still be able to use this regrettable episode as an example of how even the most basic science may be misapplied by those with a social or political agenda.

AB Solving conservation problems requires students to apply their knowledge of ecology and evolution. We present the Endangered Species Conservation through Habitat Suitability Analysis laboratory Activity, in which students perform habitat suitability analyses for endangered freshwater species, compelling application of ecological and evolutionary principles. Students gather natural history information for endangered species native to Illinois, synthesize publicly available GIS/map data and habitat requirements for an endangered species, and present evidence-based proposals identifying geographical regions that should be set aside for protection. Students discuss current freshwater conservation issues and develop conceptual understanding of evolution, ecology, and conservation principles and processes. Students are prompted to consider human inclusion in freshwater ecosystems and its consequences. This laboratory investigation is effective in highlighting naive conceptions of ecology, evolution, and conservation because students are prompted to provide rationale for their management decisions and engage in scientific discourse as they conduct their habitat suitability analyses.

ID GAMES
AB Role-playing scenarios in science education offer students an active way to engage in learning as well as to discover how their decisions as citizens, voters, or policymakers can affect environmental and public health. In this activity, students take on the role of environmental consultants, helping city planners decide the best location for a new recreation area located on the fictional community's major waterway. The objective of the game is to engage the students in critical thinking to determine the most relevant water tests needed to accept or reject the four proposed locations, given their knowledge of possible pollutants from different land-use activities. Students work in teams to integrate methods used in determining water quality, such as chemical testing, macroinvertebrate surveys, and bacterial monitoring, into a defendable decision for their recommendation. This activity was designed for and tested by high school students enrolled in AP Environmental Sciences and could be modified for undergraduate ecology or biology courses.

AB This classroom exercise aims to help students understand the three Ps of genetic complexity: polymorphic, polygenic, and pleiotropic. Using coin flips and dice rolls, students are able to generate the genotype and phenotype of a random individual. From there, students find a mate for this individual and determine the phenotype of their offspring. The randomness generated by the coin and dice mechanics illustrates the principles of independent assortment and segregation, variable gene expression, and environmental effects.

TI Can Six Minutes of Culturally Competent Evolution Education Reduce
   Students' Level of Perceived Conflict Between Evolution and Religion?
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE evolution; religion; perceived conflict; curriculum; attitudes
ID SCIENCE
AB Evolution is foundational to biology but is controversial for many undergraduate students. Although evolution and religion are potentially compatible, students' perceived conflict between their religious beliefs and evolution can negatively affect their acceptance of evolution. In a previous study, we found that illustrating the potential compatibility of religion and evolution decreased the number of students who perceived a conflict between religion and evolution by 53 percent. However, in the previous study, the instruction on the potential compatibility of religion and evolution took a significant amount of instructional time, which could be a barrier for implementation. In this current study, we condensed the instruction illustrating the potential compatibility of religion and evolution to six minutes. By conducting qualitative analyses on data gathered from ten students who perceived a conflict before the evolution module, we found that eight of these students reduced their level of perceived conflict after the evolution module. We identified eight distinct aspects of the evolution instruction that students stated reduced their perceived conflict, including that the instructor did not force student acceptance of evolution, the instructor was respectful of students with multiple viewpoints on evolution, and students experienced a greater exposure to evolution content.

AB Traditionally, science and art are not combined as an instructional method in the undergraduate biology laboratory. This research examined the differences in the construction of biology content knowledge in student work in an inquiry-based lab and in an inquiry- and arts-based lab. The qualitative research findings indicated that the students developed deeper understanding of the content knowledge when an arts-based instructional method (storytelling) was included as part of the inquiry-based instruction.

DT Article
DE Hardy-Weinberg; mathematics; geometry; evolution; manipulative
AB Introducing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium into the high school or college classroom can be difficult because many students struggle with the mathematical formalism of the Hardy-Weinberg equations. Despite the potential difficulties, incorporating Hardy-Weinberg into the curriculum can provide students with the opportunity to investigate a scientific theory using data and integrate across the disciplines of biology and mathematics. We present a geometric way to interpret and visualize Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allowing students to focus on the core ideas without algebraic baggage. We also introduce interactive applets that draw on the distributive property of mathematics to allow students to experiment in real time. With the applets, students can observe the effects of changing allele frequencies on genotype frequencies in a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Anecdotally, we found use of the geometric interpretation led to deeper student understanding of the concepts and improved the students' ability to solve Hardy-Weinberg-related problems. Students can use the ideas and tools provided here to draw connections between the biology and mathematics, as well as between algebra and geometry.

AB Regeneration has long fascinated humanity, and its documentation has progressed from simple descriptive observations to the intense molecular and cellular investigations of today. The overarching goal of this work is to make the key methods and tools being used in modern regeneration and stem cell biology research accessible to docents and students in the classroom. We have designed a series of experimental activities with accompanying protocols using four inexpensive, commercially available planarian species indigenous to North America: Girardia sp., Dugesia dorotocephala, Phagocata morgani, and Phagocata gracilis. These planarians are fast and robust regenerators, and can easily be maintained in the classroom. The activities presented here can be used to guide students through hypothesis-driven experiments, and range from simple manipulations aimed at high school students (e.g., planarian husbandry, feeding, and cutting experiments) to gene expression and protein function analyses suitable for college students. Regeneration time courses, the more complex whole worm in situ hybridizations, and RNA interference for gene knock-down experiments are described for each of the four species. Cumulatively, the suggested methods and experiments will facilitate the exploration of animal regeneration biology and promote curiosity-driven, hands-on application of the scientific method.

   inquiry-based learning; model; neuromuscular
AB We have developed an experimental module that introduces high school students to guided scientific inquiry. It is designed to incorporate environmental health and ecological concepts into the basic biology or environmental-science content of the high school curriculum. Using the red worm, a familiar live species that is amenable to classroom experimentation, students learn how environmental agents affect the animal's locomotion by altering sensory neuron-muscle interactions and, as a result, influence its distribution in nature. In turn, the results of these experiments have direct application to human-caused environmental disruptions that cause changes in species distribution and indirectly increase the recognition that environmental chemicals affect human health. Students undertake a series of explorations to identify how red worms sense their environment and then apply that knowledge to understand the effects of chemical exposure on locomotor behavior. The activities are designed to generate critical thinking about neuromuscular processes and environmental pollutants that affect them.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB We used personal mobile electronic devices (PMEDs) to engage students in a lesson to support evolutionary thinking in an undergraduate biology course. Community-college students enrolled in Biodiversity & Evolution, a core majors biology course, met for an optional field trip at the University of Idaho's McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS) in central Idaho during the summer of 2014. Ten students participated in the classroom and outdoor activities. Students were provided with directions and objectives for the lesson, and students' own PMEDs were used to capture images of the community of organisms in and around the outdoor campus. After returning from the field, students analyzed their digital data in the context of morphological similarities and differences to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis for the relationships of the organisms observed. Students' comments were solicited regarding the activity, and feedback was generally positive. From the teachers' perspective, students appeared highly engaged and the novel method was a success. We discuss the theoretical basis for using PMEDs and provide a detailed lesson plan.

AB Repeatability underpins a basic assumption in science which students must learn in order to evaluate others' research findings as well as to communicate the results of their own research. By attempting to repeat the methods of published studies, students learn the importance of clear written communication, while at the same time developing research skills. I describe three examples of published field studies that can be used as the basis for course exercises on the repeatability of methodology, as well as field sampling techniques, all grounded in the overall topic of environmental change. Two of the exercises returned students to the exact location of the past research that they had previously read from the primary literature, making it possible to clarify the difference between reproducibility and repeatability in field-based research. When student-collected data differed from published results, students explored, through both post-project discussions and written work, factors that could explain this variation, including methodology, ecological succession, and climate change. Assessments and student comments on course evaluations showed that these exercises have a positive impact on students' communication skills and engagement with the scientific process.

AB Students often have difficulty understanding inheritance patterns and issues associated with the nature of science as a process. To help address these issues, we developed a unit plan based on Gregor Mendel's well-known research on inheritance patterns among pea plants. The unit introduces students to Mendel's background and the questions he sought to address. Students then conduct their own investigation, using Virtual Genetics Lab II (VGLII) software to attempt to confirm Mendel's results. In the course of completing their investigations, students learn about alternative inheritance patterns to Mendelian genetics. The unit was created in the context of a college introductory biology course but could be implemented in a high school course.

AB We highlight some important conceptual issues that biologists should take into account when teaching evolutionary biology or communicating it to the public. We first present conclusions from conceptual development research on how particular human intuitions, namely design teleology and psychological essentialism, influence the understanding of evolution. We argue that these two intuitions form important conceptual obstacles to understanding evolution that should be explicitly addressed during instruction and public communication. Given that a major issue in evolution is understanding how very different forms may share common ancestry - antievolutionists have argued that this is inconceivable - we suggest that evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), which provides concepts and evidence that large morphological change is possible, could be used to address the intuitions that organisms have fixed essences (psychological essentialism) and that their structure indicates some kind of intentional design (design teleology).

ID CANCER
AB An understanding of how genomics information, including information about risk for common, multifactorial disease, can be used to promote personal health (personalized medicine) is becoming increasingly important for the American public. We undertook a quantitative content analysis of commonly used high school textbooks to assess how frequently the genetic basis of common multifactorial diseases was discussed compared with the "classic" chromosomal-single gene disorders historically used to teach the concepts of genetics and heredity. We also analyzed the types of conditions or traits that were discussed. We identified 3957 sentences across 11 textbooks that addressed multifactorial and "classic" genetic disorders. "Classic" gene disorders were discussed relatively more frequently than multifactorial diseases, as was their genetic basis, even after we enriched the sample to include five adult-onset conditions common in the general population. Discussions of the genetic or hereditary components of multi factorial diseases were limited, as were discussions of the environmental components of these conditions. Adult-onset multifactorial diseases are far more common in the population than chromosomal or single-gene disorders; many are potentially preventable or modifiable. As such, they are targets for personalized medical approaches. The limited discussion in biology textbooks of the genetic basis of multifactorial conditions and the role of environment in modifying genetic risk may limit the public's understanding and use of personalized medicine.

AB This simple inquiry-based lab was designed to teach the principle of osmosis while also providing an experience for students to use the skills and practices commonly found in science. Students first design their own experiment using very basic equipment and supplies, which generally results in mixed, but mostly poor, outcomes. Classroom "talk and argument" is then used to determine how their experiments could be changed to gather more reliable data. The final assessment consists of both formal and subjective testing, requiring students to explain their design choices.

AB Genetics, one of the most influential fields, underlies all of biology and produces discoveries that are in the news daily. However, many students leave introductory biology and genetics courses lacking a coherent framework of knowledge to use in their daily lives. We identify substantial "missing links" in the teaching of foundational concepts in genetics that should be addressed, as well as provide examples and suggest activities toward integration. Teaching in this manner can help students build on their knowledge in more advanced courses and allow them to use this knowledge throughout their lives.

TI Clay Caterpillar Whodunit: A Customizable Method for Studying
   Predator-Prey Interactions in the Field
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Ecology; predation; caterpillar; camouflage; field experiment;
   hypothesis testing
AB Predator-prey dynamics are an important concept in ecology, often serving as an introduction to the field of community ecology. However, these dynamics are difficult for students to observe directly. We describe a methodology that employs model caterpillars made of clay to estimate rates of predator attack on a prey species. This approach can be implemented as a field laboratory in almost any natural or seminatural setting, and is designed to allow educators to pursue any number of student-generated hypotheses representing varying degrees of scientific sophistication ranging from middle school to college level.

DT Article
DE Scientific method; inquiry; science writing; ecology; Apis mellifera
AB Many high school science students do not encounter opportunities for authentic science inquiry in their formal coursework. Ecological field studies can provide such opportunities. The purpose of this project was to teach students about the process of science by designing and conducting experiments on whether and how honey bees (Apis mellifera) avoid predators. Students summarized their findings in scientific papers and presentations to research scientists. We found that this project increased student knowledge of the scientific process, scientific writing, what scientists do, and the importance of the environment.

DT Article
DE Diabetes; animal welfare; experimental mistakes; Nobel Prize;
   self-experimentation; trial-and-error procedure
AB The nature of scientific research sometimes involves a trial-and-error procedure. Popular reviews of successful results from this approach often sanitize the story by omitting unsuccessful trials, thus painting the rosy impression that research simply follows a direct route from hypothesis to experiment to scientific discovery. The discovery of insulin is a classical case study in this genre that begs for an explanation to our students because it is so often ignored or misrepresented even in biology and physiology textbooks.

   chemistry
ID BACTERIA; RESISTANCE; DIVERSITY; SOIL
AB Tannins are plant chemicals that humans find useful in products as diverse as tea and leather. Why do plants produce these compounds? One possible answer is defense against pathogens and herbivores. In this series of laboratory exercises, student inquiry begins with a simple question: What happens to the multitude of leaves that drop each autumn? This inquiry brings students from the outdoors to the laboratory, where they observe differences in leaf decomposition rates and the natural abundance of bacteria and tannin concentrations in leaf tissues of red oak, white oak, and tulip poplar. In the process, students increase their understanding of plant chemistry, bacterial culture, graphing, and natural history, while experiencing the iterative nature of scientific inquiry.

AB Teaching biology, science, or for that matter any subject involves signals of how we view and value our students and community. It is easy to send signals that students interpret differently than we intend just by a lack of awareness. Depending on your district's culture, creating community can have different challenges. Here, we will outline two areas where everyone can adjust their signals to create an environment that is inviting to students, colleagues, and our school community. Being aware of the intellectual and physical space we are creating can encourage students to be open to learning and help them to feel valued as a part of our learning community.

TI Assessing the Importance of Chemosensory Cues in Web-Building Spiders:
   An Inquiry-Based Investigation for Secondary Education Students
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE inquiry-based learning; NGSS; chemosensory detection; spiders
ID ARANEAE
AB Spiders rely on chemosensory cues to help locate prey, evade predators, and select mates. This reliance on chemosensory detection makes spiders an ideal organism for inquiry-based projects that students can design and conduct on a shoestring budget. This investigation, designed for secondary education grades (6-12), encourages students to examine whether chemosensory cues influence web construction of harmless female spiders collected from backyard habitats. Students work in groups to develop hypotheses that they later test by introducing spiders into a simple T-maze containing some mix of chemosensory cues. To pilot this study, I designed two experiments to determine how female spiders construct their webs in response to chemosensory cues of potential prey or dangerous fire ants. The data from both projects were compiled and statistically analyzed using open-source software available online. In a classroom or laboratory setting, your students can work in groups to develop their own hypotheses, design and run their experiments, and statistically analyze their results using the same free software. Although simple in design, this activity provides students with an opportunity to develop novel lines of research inquiry and engage in the practice of science.

TI Radiocarbon in Dinosaur Bones Revisited: Problems with Collagen
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE dinosaurs; creationism; radiocarbon; collagen; recrystallization;
   carbonate; contamination; fossilization
ID FOSSILS COMPATIBILITY; MIDDLE; AGE; MILLIONS; DATES; SITE
AB Evidence from isotopes other than radiocarbon shows that dinosaur fossils are millions of years old. Despite that, bone mineral from Mesozoic dinosaur fossils yields a falsely young radiocarbon date of less than 50,000 years, due to its accumulation of new radiocarbon via recrystallization. Similarly, the so-called collagen fraction of Mesozoic fossil bone (actually the total organic fraction) yields a falsely young date, due to the presence of organic contaminants, including glue that is added during fossil excavation. The contaminants are responsible for the falsely young radiocarbon date. That problem can be overcome by the HYP method: subjecting only the hydroxyproline (the part of the collagen fraction that is specific to collagen) in the collagen fraction to radiocarbon dating. Science educators need to be aware of the details of these phenomena, so as to be able to advise students whose acceptance of biological evolution has been challenged by young-Earth creationist arguments that are based on radiocarbon in dinosaur bone collagen.

AB Teaching cellular respiration in the secondary classroom requires a carefully crafted approach. The discipline, though complex, represents the cornerstone of cellular metabolic transactions. Therefore, this article proposes a method to engage students in the subject through an agricultural lens. Specifically; this will be done by having students consider why animals eat feed and where feed energy goes. After developing an appreciation for such feeding dynamics in animals, students will be better suited for studying the molecular nature of cellular respiration.

AB Evolutionary anthropologists commonly describe humans as a highly cooperative species, based on our evolved socio-cognitive capacities. However, students and the general public may not necessarily share this view about our species. At the same time, fostering our ability to cooperate is considered a key foundation for achieving sustainable development, and students' understanding of the conditions that enable or hinder cooperation is therefore an important learning goal in sustainability education. In this article, we describe a small classroom activity that explored students' and preservice biology teachers' preconceptions about the human capacity to cooperate around shared resources in comparison to the capacity of our closest relative, the chimpanzee. Results indicate that students and teachers had limited knowledge about the evolved human capacity for cooperation around shared resources in small groups, most often viewing chimpanzees as more capable of cooperation and sustainable resource use. Based on the results of this classroom intervention, we highlight important learning opportunities for educators in biology on teaching human evolution and human behavior, particularly as related to current challenges of sustainable development.

AB Students sometimes struggle to organize complex concepts and visualize the connectedness of hierarchical groups, yet much of the biological sciences depends on ranking, ordering, or grouping of information. Diagnosing disease, converting units, and evolutionary relationships all follow stepwise ranking of groups of information. This article presents a cooperative, low-stakes, inexpensive method for novice students to organize hierarchical information. As an example, students work together placing and rearranging animal cards according to taxonomic and evolutionary relationships along a string using shared characteristics. The cards provided address Next Generation Science Standards pertaining to inheritance/variation (LS3) and unity and diversity (LS4). I provide a detailed description of the activity as well as the tools needed to perform this lesson.

AB The proposed lesson, a model active-learning activity designed to give college students experience in synthesizing information and developing a solution, can be used to address socioscientific issues across fields. As a consequence of climate change, global temperatures are anticipated to rise. This rise in temperature is expected to have a negative impact on agricultural systems due in part to increased disease incidence and decrease in crop yields. This activity is written in the context of plant pathology and agricultural systems to emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication among scientists or experts in different fields to address global agricultural issues. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of agriculture on a global scale and work together to develop a solution through the development of an agricultural policy.

ID ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE
AB Computational thinking (CT) is a thought process composed of computer science ideas and skills that can be applied to solve problems and better understand the world around us. With the increase in technology and computing, STEM disciplines are becoming interwoven with computing. In order to better prepare students for STEM careers, computational literacy needs to be developed in K-12 education. We advocate the introduction of computational literacy through the incorporation of CT in core science courses, such as biology. Additionally, at least some of this integration should be unplugged, or without computers, so that all schools can participate in developing computational literacy. These lessons integrate unplugged CT and science content to help students develop CT competencies and learn natural selection content simultaneously through a series of lessons in which unplugged CT is leveraged for natural selection learning within varying contexts. In these lessons, students engage in the creation of handwritten algorithmic explanations of natural selection. Students build CT skills while making sense of the process, resulting in converged learning about CT and science. This article presents a description of CT, the specifics of the classroom implementation and lessons, student work and outcomes, and conclusions drawn from this work.

AB The ability to make criteria-based and thought-out decisions in everyday life as well as to answer questions pertaining to society at large, such as those regarding climate change and the loss of biodiversity, is becoming more and more important against the backdrop of an increasingly complex world with a wide range of options for action or inaction. Using the method of "data-based decision making," this article presents a decision-making strategy for improving the evaluation competence of students that is particularly suitable f or teaching socioscientific issues in the context of sustainable development. Using the example of human consumption of insects (sometimes termed "entomophagy," although this term is defined as the consumption of insects by any organism), the students will evaluate the potential for insects as an alternative, sustainable source of protein as compared with conventional meat.

AB Innovation in assessment of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses in subjects such as biology and biochemistry is a widely discussed topic. We report the use of a novel, research-integrated course assessment designed to increase students' self-motivation and improve their learning outcomes. We encouraged submissions to peer-reviewed journals, supported by stepwise supervision on writing by the instructor, which led to possible publication of some student-written articles. We compared the results from two classes in 2015 and 2016, assessing the quality of the published articles on the basis of journal impact factor, journal Scopus score, and number of citations of each article, using supervised assignments to fulfill this goal. Assessment of research-integrated biology learning via potential publishing may motivate students to actively learn a biochemistry topic and encourage early-career professional development.

AB Collecting meaningful data in an undergraduate human physiology lab course can be difficult for a variety of reasons. I describe a way of creating an inquiry based, semester-long project that allows students practice in designing retrospective research questions using a large database containing common physiology data. The database generated during this project has the capability of adding new participants each semester the course is taught. This approach can be used with a variety of different physiology acquisition systems and can easily be specialized for the learning outcomes of a given physiology laboratory course.

   Classroom Action Research in Biology Classroom
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Classroom action research; cultural-historical activity theory; teacher
   as researcher; reflective practice; qualitative research
ID TEACHERS
AB Classroom action research (CAR) represents a midpoint between teacher reflection at one end and traditional educational research at the other. CAR is a process in which a teacher identifies problems in the context of his or her own classroom and then engages in investigative methods to address the problems. Teachers sometimes shy away from CAR, due to their lack of training in research methodology, time constraints, and the fact that not all schools value or support such a scholarship of teaching and learning. I show how cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) could be used as a practical lens when engaging in CAR, and how this could help biology teachers become more reflective practitioners by using a rigorous tool to analyze data. Third-generation CHAT is explained and the reader is shown, through a practical example, how research findings could be analyzed and interpreted through a CHAT lens.

AB Trees are the largest organisms students usually encounter in their daily lives. However, most are unaware of the critical roles trees play in their local environments. As critical components of green infrastructure, trees improve air quality, mitigate storm-water runoff, and provide food and habitat for other organisms. Using the cross-platform and open-source software Bioimages Collection Manager (BCM), we created an online interactive arboretum guide for a university campus arboretum. Faculty, students, and visitors can scan tree tags with their mobile devices and access biological metadata, participate in self-guided tree tours, and learn about the ecology and ethnobotany of individual tree species. Importantly, this approach may be replicated for other campuses, school yards, and additional green spaces.

TI Use of Crime Scene Investigations in Anatomy and Physiology: Potential
   for Going Beyond Knowing in NGSS Dimensions
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE scientific practices; crime scene investigation; blood; inquiry; NGSS;
   anatomy and physiology
AB To create and implement meaningful tasks that go beyond the cognitive processes of understanding and that integrate all three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is challenging for both educators and curriculum makers. This issue is compounded when considering a content-rich biology course such as anatomy and physiology that requires first familiarity and understanding before engagement in higher-order thinking. The use of crime scene investigations that encourages students to examine evidence even as they learn specific biology concepts can encourage meaning making about scientific practices and science content. This paper deconstructs the implementation of a crime scene investigation titled the "Jewel Heist," created by the New York Hall of Science and implemented in twelfth-grade anatomy and physiology classes in a diverse urban high school in the northeastern United States. The NGSS, the Framework for K-12 Science Education, along with Bloom's taxonomy and Krathwohl's revisions, are implicated in this process.

DE life history; ecology; body size; reproduction
ID EVOLUTION
AB Life history trade-offs provide an opportunity for students to learn about concepts in ecology, evolutionary biology, and natural history. Here I present a simple activity that I created to help students use data from museums and online life history databases to explore the relationship between body size and reproductive ability in birds. This activity, which guides students in hypothesis development and testing, data collection, and statistical analysis, is applicable to students at the high school and undergraduate levels. In addition, although I focused on birds, this activity can also be applied to other taxa where life history data are available.

ID SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; RACE; GENES; GENETICS; BELIEFS
AB Race is a hot-button topic in American society, but one that needs to be addressed in the biological science curriculum. This paper examines how college students in a large introductory course came to understand race through the exploration of four key concepts about the nature of human biological and genetic variation. Using clicker data collected from four courses (n = 296), change in starting and ending understanding of content was compared using paired t-tests and mean difference scores. Results indicate statistically significant improvement in student understanding of common fallacies of the "biological race concept" after a single exposure to content.

AB In efforts to develop a unique pedagogy for underrepresented high school and undergraduate students, we developed a pilot study to determine the effectiveness of vertically integrating STEM research education from high school students through Ph.D. candidates. The interdisciplinary research project's overarching goal is to assess the impact of environmental pollutants (specifically, platinum group elements found in road dust) on eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and develop computational models to predict the outcomes of exposure. Ultimately, the project involves elements of fate and transport of platinum group elements in soil, water, and air and their impacts on environmental microbiology, eukaryotic cell signaling, and environmental computational modeling. Our vertically integrated and aligned mentorship model paired high school students with undergraduates, M.S. students, and Ph.D. students in various laboratories. To complement their laboratory research exposure, students also attended professional development seminars on resume preparation, literature mining/searching, preparation of manuscripts, presentation of data, and critical reading of peer-reviewed articles. Our pilot study was very successful in exposing future STEM workers (high school students and college undergraduates) to meaningful research experiences that they translated into seven poster and oral presentations, three review articles (in preparation), three journal articles, and improved attitudes toward STEM careers.

AB Class discussion can be a valuable way to meet educational standards and make student ideas visible. Tools like Twitter can be used to encourage discussion both in and outside of class. In this article, we provide (1) a concise explanation of Twitter and its use (including a comparison to similar digital communication tools); (2) a brief overview of educational gains and experiences in using Twitter; and (3) a step-by-step introduction to conducting Twitter discussions using hashtags. We conclude with an introduction to #scistuchat, a monthly Twitter discussion between scientists and students that addresses many of the core ideas in the biological sciences. We invite instructors to join this ongoing discussion series or use the ideas within this paper to begin their own discussion groups on social media.

AB Streams and stream macroinvertebrates are ideal natural systems for ecological inquiry. We present three simple experiments that students can use to conduct field-based investigations which illustrate the importance of algae-based food webs in streams and measure the effects of sediment pollution (scour and deposition) on stream ecological processes. Over the past 5 years, we have conducted these experiments 19 times with our students. We report on the results and reliability of these experiments and make suggestions for other educators who may want to conduct them.

   organization; dehydration synthesis; organelles; plastids; amyloplasts;
   starch; sugar; glucose
AB Bananas can be used in many classroom lab activities to make carbohydrates easier for students to understand. I detail a simple series of banana activities that can be used to investigate carbohydrates across a wide range of levels of organization and that serve to connect carbohydrate concepts that might otherwise seem disparate to students. For example, the taste of a banana is linked to carbohydrate hydrolysis, as well as to organelle content within banana cells. Bananas can be used safely in any classroom, and inquiry-based learning can be used to progress through related course content. In addition, students will gain expertise in understanding cells viewed through the microscope as they try to examine the starch in the bananas.

   TRAITS; ANATOMY; DEGENERATION; CONSERVATION; CONSTRAINTS; INHERITANCE
AB Lists of vestigial biological structures in biology textbooks are so short that some young-Earth creationist authors claim that scientists have lost confidence in the existence of vestigial structures and can no longer identify any verifiable ones. We tested these hypotheses with a method that is easily adapted to biology classes. We used online search engines to find examples of 21st-century articles in primary scientific literature in which biological structures are identified as vestigial. Our results falsify these creationist hypotheses and show that scientists currently identify many structures as vestigial in animals, plants, and single-celled organisms. Examples include not only organs but also cells, organelles, and parts of molecules. Having students repeat this study will give them experience with hypothesis testing, introduce them to primary scientific articles, and further their education on vestigial structures.

AB Achieving a deep understanding of the many topics covered in middle school biology classes is difficult for many students. One way to help students learn these topics is through scenario-based learning, which enhances students' performance. The scenario-based problem-solving module presented here, "The Strawberry Caper," not only meets but connects ecological and genetic concepts that are required standards in middle school. Here, students are required to provide expert witness for a patent-infringement claim against an organic strawberry farmer by a large neighboring company. The students must think critically and formulate and test hypotheses to provide evidence for the case. Through phenotypic and genotypic analyses, the students are immersed in an inquiry-driven investigation that provides a real-world context for topics covered in the classroom. This, interspersed with integration of concepts, promotes understanding and application of these topics.

ID CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT
AB One of the key aspects of natural selection is competition, yet the concept of competition is not necessarily emphasized in explanations of natural selection. Because of this, we developed an activity for our class that focuses on competition and provides an example of the effects of competition on natural selection. This hands-on activity models the field study completed by David Lack on Darwin's finches. By using this historical study, we also give students an example of the nature-of-science concept of multiple methods. Although this activity was created for a college introductory biology course, it is appropriate for high school. We also provide an additional objective for upper-level ecology and evolution courses.

DE Creationism; Carl Baugh; paleontology; Paluxy "man tracks"; teaching

AB The alleged "man tracks" beside dinosaur tracks near Glen Rose, Texas, are among the most enduring pieces of evidence used by young-Earth creationists to reject evolution. Despite the tracks' fame, their most persistent advocate - that is, Carl Baugh of the Creation Evidence Museum - has published neither (1) peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals about the tracks nor (2) clear, convincing, unenhanced photographs of unaltered tracks taken during an excavation. I participated in an excavation sponsored by Baugh's Creation Evidence Museum that uncovered three "man tracks" that Baugh and his assistants verified as being made by humans. These "tracks" are presented here and are among the first clear, unenhanced photographs of freshly uncovered "man tracks" taken during a Baugh-led excavation. They look no different than any of the countless other scuffs, cracks, and erosion marks in the area.

AB Evaluating the potential health impacts of chemical, physical, and biological environmental factors represents a challenging task with profound medical, public health, and historical implications. The history of public health is replete with instances, ranging from tobacco to lead and asbestos, where the ability to obtain evidence on potential environmental hazards has been impaired and the publication of results delayed because of commercial interests. The burden of proof is heavy on those trying to change the status quo when that involves highly profitable industries. When evaluating potential hazards that are linked with industrial activities, it is often the case that only after proof of human or environmental harm becomes undeniable are steps finally taken to control or reduce future hazards. This approach has the net effect of delaying and postponing action, allowing dangerous practices to continue until health or environmental risks have become undebatable.

AB The National Science Foundation's GK-12 program provides a unique opportunity for STEM collaboration between the K-12 classroom and university research. This partnership benefits students through experiential learning, exposure to research, exceptional mentorship, and preparation for postsecondary education. Additionally, researchers gain valuable skills by explaining difficult scientific concepts to high school students and broadening their exposure to secondary education. We present graduate-research-based activities focused on understanding the genetic causes of Down syndrome. Modification of these activities could accommodate educational levels from middle school to entry-level college biology. This lesson involves several biological and data-collecting techniques. These experiential activities help students understand genetics and Down syndrome, and introduce

AB Understanding how DNA banding patterns in a gel can aid in the conviction or exoneration of suspects and be utilized for positive identification of biological fathers in paternity cases can be intimidating. In reality, the logistics and technology used in such cases are rather straightforward. This exercise is designed for use in high school environments as a stand-alone paper lab and as a primer to an actual wet-lab experience, if available. Upon conclusion of the experience, students will have confidence in understanding how DNA fingerprinting can constitute strong evidence in forensic analysis.

TI Ecology Content in Introductory Biology Courses: A Comparative Analysis
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Content coverage; ecological literacy; introductory biology;
   institutional location; NABT recommendations
ID 20-1ST CENTURY; CONSEQUENCES; CURRICULUM; EDUCATION; MAJORS
AB In recent years the need for ecological literacy and problem solving has increased, but there is no evidence that this need is reflected by increased ecology coverage at institutions of higher education (IHE) across the United States. Because introductory biology courses may serve to direct student interest toward particular biological categories such as ecology, time devoted to topics in these categories within introductory biology courses may be crucial for captivating student interest. In a 2009 survey, members of the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) College and University Sections identified 20 topics they considered essential for inclusion in introductory biology courses. The NABT members, acknowledging the importance of ecological concepts, considered two ecological topics essential. The present study evaluated the actual coverage of ecology and other topic categories compared to recommendations and according to location. For this purpose, lecture and lab syllabi were collected from 26 rural, suburban, and urban IHEs from the Mid-Atlantic region. Course content was divided into eight categories, including ecology, and percentages of total lecture and lab time per category were calculated. This actual coverage was compared to the NABT recommendations. Actual coverage of ecology was not significantly different from coverage recommended by the NABT members, whereas cell/molecular/biochemistry and evolution were lower and genetics, development, and taxonomy were higher than recommended. Course content was also compared by location, with no significant effect of institutional location on ecology coverage. We conclude that although students taking introductory biology courses in Mid-Atlantic IHEs are likely to receive the NABT's recommended coverage of ecology instruction regardless of institutional location, actual ecology coverage has not increased, regardless of the increased need for ecological literacy.

AB The process of protein translation and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can often be challenging for introductory college biology students to visualize. To help them understand how proteins become oriented in the ER membrane, I developed a hands-on activity in which students use Play-Doh to simulate the process of protein insertion into the ER membrane. After completing the hands-on activity, students are better able to solve problems in which they have to predict the membrane orientation of a protein.

AB Evaluating the strength of evidence in noisy data is a critical step in scientific thinking that typically relies on statistics. Students without statistical training will benefit from heuristic models that highlight the logic of statistical analysis. The likelihood associated with various coin-tossing outcomes gives students such a model. There is a point at which a majority of students will doubt the underlying fairness of a coin-tossing game, and that student-generated cutoff can be used as a critical value in a nonparametric analysis of paired data. Following this approach, student lab reports come to more closely model scientific thinking.

AB The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a common technique used in high school and undergraduate science teaching. Students often do not fully comprehend the underlying principles of the technique and how optimization of the protocol affects the outcome and analysis. In this molecular biology laboratory, students learn the steps of PCR with an emphasis on primer composition and annealing temperature, which they manipulate to test the effect on successful DNA amplification. Students design experiments to test their hypotheses, promoting a discovery-based approach to laboratory teaching and development of critical-thinking and reasoning skills.

AB All scientists use the scientific method to investigate the unknown by developing a hypothesis, designing an experiment, collecting data, and interpreting findings. The purpose of this activity is to teach middle school students about the scientific method and foraging ecology as they investigate a foraging behavior (strand feeding) of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We tested this activity on middle school students and found that the activity promoted student inquiry, ingenuity, and critical thinking as the students used the scientific method to answer questions about strand feeding.

AB This article presents a brief overview of the impact that antibiotic use in clinical medicine and in other settings, such as agriculture and animal farming, exerts on antimicrobial resistance. Resistance has been described to all antibiotics that are currently in use, and resistant strains were sometimes reported as soon as months after specific antibiotics became commercially available. There are many examples in which the increasing prevalence of resistant microbial strains jeopardized the continuing effective use of the respective antibiotics in clinical medicine. In addition to resistant infections that occur in health-care establishments, one of the recent challenges is the emergence of pathogens, such as MRSA, in the community, among individuals without any apparent risk factors for the infection. The transmission of resistant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance determinants across different components of the ecosystem transforms antibiotic resistance into a topic that extends beyond the scope of clinical medicine and needs to be visualized through an integrated global perspective that should incorporate a broad range of disciplines, including molecular genetics, microbiology, food science, ecology, agriculture, and environmental science. Understanding this complex multi- and interdisciplinary framework will enable the implementation of the most appropriate interventions toward determining the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance, limiting the emergence and spread of resistant strains, and ensuring the ongoing effective and safe use of antibiotics.

   cellulose-degrading microbes
AB We present a laboratory-based exercise that is used to teach basic lab skills (e. g., aseptic technique and enumeration) using naturally occurring microbial communities in a real biological context. Students examine the colonization by microbial communities of leaves that fall into streams. Leaf decomposition reflects enzymatic activity by microorganisms such as aquatic fungi and bacteria and maceration by invertebrate shredders. The microorganisms help facilitate the cycling of nutrients and energy in the stream's ecosystem. This exercise effectively teaches students to use lab skills to quantify microorganisms found in nature, investigates groups of microorganisms involved in leaf degradation in streams, and stimulates interest in both microbiology and ecology.

AB Clay models have proved to be useful teaching aids for many topics in biology that depend on three-dimensional reasoning. Students studying embryonic development struggle to mentally reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of embryos and larvae by observing prepared slides of cross-sectional slices. Students who build clay models of embryos and slice them into cross sections, however, have a much easier time interpreting the slices of real embryos and gain a deeper understanding of development in three dimensions.

AB Designing classroom assessment tasks that can gather meaningful assessment information is a complex undertaking. This is especially the case when it comes to developing assessment tasks to evaluate students' abilities to plan scientific investigations. Such assessment tasks should adequately elicit students' cognitive understandings related to designing valid and reliable experiments, not just their hands-on manipulative skills. This article proposes a set of guidelines for developing written assessment tasks that can surface students' cognitive understandings related to planning scientific investigations. We show how the checklist created based on the design guidelines can be used to analyze two classroom assessment tasks. The guidelines will be useful for teachers as they develop new or modify existing classroom assessment tasks to meaningfully evaluate students' abilities to plan scientific investigations.

TI Teaching Nutrient Cycling and Climate Change Concepts Using Excretion
   Experiments with Common Fish
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE nutrient cycling; inquiry; climate change
AB Many high school students learn about nutrient cycling during biology, environmental science, and agriculture classes. These lessons often focus on soil and plants, and nutrient cycling is usually taught independently from climate change. Scientists know that animals, including fish, can have strong effects on nutrient cycling (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) in ecosystems. Additionally, research has shown that nitrogen and phosphorus excretion rates of animals increase with water temperatures. We worked with high school students to design and conduct nutrient excretion experiments using common fish (zebrafish) to explore the impact of climate change on nutrient cycling. This allowed students to have hands-on laboratory experience. In 2021, we worked with students participating in a residential summer program in Georgia. Meanwhile, in 2022, students enrolled in the local high school visited the university campus on two occasions to participate in the experiments, and we once again worked with students in Georgia. Students from all three groups showed an increased understanding of the role of animals in nutrient cycling and ways climate change may impact these processes, despite variable results from the excretion experiments. Students also showed increased understanding of science processes and were more likely to feel like part of the science community. We believe that these experiments can be done in high school classrooms to expand students' understanding of the scientific process, nutrient cycling, and climate change.

ID UNDERGRADUATE BIOLOGY; BLOOMS TAXONOMY; MODELING THEORY
AB Organismal biology (OrgBio) comprises the diversity, structures, and functions of all organisms from bacteria to humans. Arguably, OrgBio is often the most poorly taught and least conceptually rigorous section of the introductory biology sequence offered at most U.S. institutions of higher education. This article reports on the successful implementation of conceptual and pedagogical reforms in an introductory OrgBio course offered at a large public university. Conceptual reforms were based on a theoretical framework consisting of universal physical and chemical laws, deep molecular homologies, and diverse structure-function relationships. Pedagogical reforms involved the development of group active engagements (GAEs) that were designed to encourage students to develop their abilities to engage in principles-based reasoning. A new model for characterizing different approaches toward principles-based reasoning in biology was developed to analyze these GAEs. Two surveys indicated that OrgBio students developed more favorable perceptions about the effectiveness of GAE-based course offerings, as compared to similar lecture-based versions.

AB Students are often intimidated by genetic evolution equations because they do not relate to everyday concepts. We developed and piloted an instructional scaffolding patterned after income tax return forms that students use to calculate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, natural selection, and mutation-selection balance of alleles. Students sequentially solve these evolution equations by entering variables into a series of cascading calculations similar to an Internal Revenue Service Tax Form 1040. We discuss suggestions for implementation of this exercise and demonstrate through assessment data that students have improved understanding of these equations after its application.

AB Scientific practices are still largely absent from undergraduate curricula. Incorporating primary scientific literature (PSL) and podcasting into course curricula is an engaging way to provide instruction in scientific practices to undergraduate students. We present an innovative class project for biology undergraduates where students read a piece of PSL, develop annotations to learn more about the research contained within the PSL, and develop and produce a podcast episode to share the research findings with a general audience. To understand student perceptions of the project, we conducted surveys to obtain qualitative responses along with measures of science identity and project ownership. We found that the students felt like the project belonged to them and that their work on the project would ultimately benefit the scientific community. Here, we include a project handbook, schedule, and materials that can be used by any instructor to carry out this project.

ID CLASSROOM
AB In this manuscript, we share a free, downloadable activity to teach viral transmission, efficacy of vaccination, and the value of safety compliance measures. It takes approximately 30-40 minutes to conduct following a 5-minute introduction. Additional discussion / out-of-class-assignment time can be varied and adapted to meet the level and time of classes. Sophomore pharmacy majors taking an anatomy and physiology class and junior and senior biology / molecular biology majors taking virology or immunology classes were given a set of questions to assess their comprehension of risk factors for COVID-19 and vaccine prioritization before conducting the activity and after performing the activity. In general, 35% of the time, all groups of students correctly identified the appropriate order of factors assessed according to their impact on COVID-19 risk. Juniors and seniors had markedly greater depth of understanding as a result of completing the activity. While sophomore improvement was less impressive, the sophomores improved their understanding of all addressed complicating factors for COVID-19 infection. Students were also asked to rate the activity for fun and learning effectiveness: 73% of sophomore students and 79% of junior and senior students graded the activity an A or a B for fun, and 74% of sophomore students and 90% of junior and senior students gave the activity an A or B for helping them to understand viral transmission.

AB Globally, most human caloric intake is from crops that belong to the grass family (Poaceae), including sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), rice (Oryza sativa), maize (or corn, Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The grasses have a unique morphology and inflorescence architecture, and some have also evolved an uncommon photosynthesis pathway that confers drought and heat tolerance, the C-4 pathway. Most secondary-level students are unaware of the global value of these crops and are unfamiliar with plant science fundamentals such as grass architecture and the genetic concepts of genotype and phenotype. Green foxtail millet (Setaria viridis) is a model organism for C-4 plants and a close relative of globally important grasses, including sugarcane. It is ideal for teaching about grass morphology, the economic value of grasses, and the C-4 photosynthetic pathway. This article details a teaching module that uses S. viridis to engage entire classrooms of students in authentic research through a laboratory investigation of grass morphology, growth cycle, and genetics. This module includes protocols and assignments to guide students through the process of growing one generation of S. viridis mutants and reference wild-type plants from seed to seed, taking measurements, making critical observations of mutant phenotypes, and discussing their physiological implications.

AB Soil provides innumerable valuable ecosystem services, such as the production of food and the direct support of wildlife, by ensuring the availability of adequate habitat. However, unsustainable human activities are resulting in degradation of soils worldwide. Hence, it is of utmost importance to raise awareness about this often-overlooked environmental issue. This article presents an inquiry-based activity that challenges students to assess the ecological quality of soil in the surroundings of their classroom. Plus, students and teachers are invited to become citizen scientists by sharing their data with researchers, thus contributing to a future endeavor to map soil quality through broad geographic ranges.

AB This hands-on lab allows students to explore concepts and quantify effects of ocean acidification. Many laboratory activities simplify ocean acidification through computer simulations or dripping acid on nonliving materials (e.g., sea shells) but do not provide adequate opportunities for students to measure, inquire, or see real consequences for living organisms. Thus, we developed this low-cost, easily accessible experiment to imitate ocean acidification on living, calcifying organisms.

AB Biomimicry, the process of using nature to guide innovative thinking and development, can be useful in helping students grasp scientific concepts. Teachers interested in incorporating biomimicry into lesson plans might find that experiential learning at informal science institutions (ISIs) with natural models and artifacts is a valuable tool to accompany classroom learning. Visiting these ISIs, students have the opportunity to observe nature in real time and be immersed in inspiration. As students explore these natural models in habitats and exhibits, educators might ask students to consider the interesting features they observe and to creatively consider innovative designs that these features could inspire. For example, an elephant's trunk might inspire a robotic arm. These direct experiences at ISIs might draw upon students' innate biophilia to learn more about living organisms and lead to increased creativity and design output. I developed this guide based on my experiences as an informal biomimicry educator and my 2017 keynote address presented at the Annual Docent Conference at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.

AB Human rights issues can be topics of conflict, resistance, and indifference; thus, these issues are seldom broached in traditional college STEM courses. In this article, I share process, content, and sources used to introduce college students to the biology of the singularity of race and the biology of sexual identity. One or two class meetings on the connections between biology and human rights were all that was necessary for students to recognize that science courses in fields such as human anatomy and physiology should address human rights issues; science courses can be used as venues to help explain human differences, and these discussions can be of personal significance and use to students.

AB Teaching evolution in high school and in entry-level college courses can be challenging due to the inherent misinformation, misunderstanding, and biases with which students approach the topic. In this setting, it is critical to both teach the basic concepts and address common student misconceptions about evolution. We present two paired activities that allow students to (1) explore the processes of natural selection in a direct and experiential way and (2) address common misconceptions in evolutionary theory. The first activity, the "Natural Selection Game," has students simulate a bird population and experience shifts in phenotype frequency as a result of selective pressures. Following the end of the game, students discuss the outcomes and connect them to real-life examples. The second activity encourages students to actively research common misconceptions with the use of personal technology in order to distinguish between scientifically supported data and poor information online. Both activities can be incorporated in high school and university-level general biology curricula. They will allow students to connect their firsthand experiences to lecture-based instruction and, as a result, develop a stronger understanding of the mechanisms of evolution.

AB Instructors at rural, two-year institutions have many insights that can inform biology instruction at other colleges to promote rural students' success in the sciences. We present four principles, derived front three case studies of experienced rural instructors, to consider when teaching rural students. These include connecting to students' lives, being attentive to their needs in and out of the classroom, having a rigorous curriculum, and providing expansive learning opportunities. These principles capitalize on the strengths of rural students rather than their shortcomings.

AB Object-based learning is an approach that aims to foster observational skills and sensory awareness. Paradoxical plant objects that do not lend themselves to all-too-easy explanations and interpretations can be used to practice the search for ecological explanations and the formation of evolutionary hypotheses. They can be the basis of particularly fruitful and rewarding learning experiences. Gleditsia triacanthos, the honey locust, is a commonly planted ornamental tree. It exhibits striking structures of defense against - and fruit that point to a mutualism with - large animals. These structures, possibly developed in coevolution with Pleistocene faunas, invite a discussion of the complex, neither fully antagonistic nor fully mutualistic, relationships between plants and animals.

AB Open textbooks are free, online resources that can replace traditional textbooks and save students money. The costs of traditional textbooks continue to increase, and this can particularly affect at-risk low-income students. Few studies have analyzed student perceptions of open textbooks and how they influence academic achievement, but the emerging trend is positive. In the present study, I assessed student perceptions of an open textbook and calculated the subsequent cost savings. Although there were some limitations to my study, such as a low sample size my results closely mirror previous studies in that most students had favorable opinions of the open textbook and would prefer to use them over traditional textbooks. the average cost savings per student was $81 for one course, determined using a novel method that does not assume all students buy new textbooks. These savings were likely important to the students, the majority of whom worked five hours or more and have received Pell Grants or other tuition waivers.

ID RACE; PERFORMANCE; STUDENTS; GENDER
AB Higher education must improve student retention and graduation rates to meet increased demand for STEM degrees in the workforce projected for the next ten years. The high rate of attrition among STEM students entering college compels institutions to implement strategies that improve student retention because more states now employ performance-based funding models with increased pressures to improve student outcomes, such as first-and second-year retention rates. We piloted a two-year hierarchical mentoring model as part of a first-year experience course developed for biology students (BioSkills) to increase retention rates among first-time-in-college (FTIC) students. We describe the mentoring structure we adopted and how the design of BioSkills supports and educates future biology professionals. Our findings show that FTIC students who participated in this program earned significantly higher first-year GPAs and were retained at higher rates than students who did not participate, which documents the impact of BioSkills as a successful first-year intervention. However, we were surprised that the benefit of BioSkills was not replicated among under-represented minority (URM) students. We briefly speculate on explanations for this finding. Lastly, we offer best practice suggestions for future implementation.

ID GRAVITROPISM; EXERCISES; STUDENTS
AB Presented here is a simple teaching lab to illustrate the dynamic qualities of plant movement using smartphones to create movies of gravitropism and circumnutation. Within as little as 90 minutes, students can observe dramatic changes in plant position using the easy-to-grow, simple genetic model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Student assessment revealed that 64 percent of students stated that this lab increased their interest in plants; and interestingly, 46 percent of students showed their movies to individuals who were not associated with the teaching lab, strongly suggesting that this teaching method can be used to propagate interest in plants to individuals in society at large.

AB As the world's population grows, sustainable food production and consumption has emerged as a complex biological problem. Managing this problem will require informed action by all citizens, which necessitates heightened comprehension of complicated quantitative datasets from multiple sources of information. This makes it imperative that undergraduates develop quantitative skills and information literacy in the context of biology. This laboratory module provides a framework for conducting discovery experiments that examine the resource demand (i.e., water use) of cultivation methods (compost-based, hydroponic) and their impact on the nutritional value of microgreens. Students use experimental and published data to compare the nutritional value and resource demands of microgreens to that of vegetables produced on industrial farms. Quantitative analyses culminate in critical thinking and discussion through which students come to a consensus on the potential of microgreens to be a sustainably produced crop that serves human nutritional needs.

AB Traditionally, exploration of ecosystems in the context of undergraduate education has been restricted to connections within conventionally defined habitats (i.e., within a stream, within a forest). Further, instruction regarding the aquatic-terrestrial interface has emphasized directional inputs from land to water. However, a relatively new body of research has characterized reciprocal interactions and draws attention to fluxes from water to land, including the emergence of aquatic insects that serve as prey for terrestrial predators. We present a guide to an inquiry-based lesson for undergraduate biology that explores interactions and connections across aquatic and terrestrial habitat boundaries. The focus is on cross-habitat linkages within ecosystems, specifically addressing the question, What is the role of insect emergence in connecting the web of life linking aquatic and terrestrial habitats and organisms? Students (1) engage with a documentary film, (2) explore insect emergence and make observations of riparian insectivores, (3) explain the collected data, (4) elaborate on alternative study designs and a measure of ecosystem health, and (5) evaluate their new understanding. This lesson addresses core concepts and competencies for undergraduate biology education, as identified in the Vision and Change report.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate how assessment instruments could be used in the college biology classroom for purposes other than researching instructional strategies (as they have been used in the past). Through participatory action research, a science educator and a biology faculty member examined how the CINS (Concept Inventory of Natural Selection) could be incorporated into the biology faculty member's classroom instruction. This paper shows that biology faculty members can use assessment instruments to build in-class activities and labs, to formatively assess student knowledge, and to confront student misconceptions. Several recommendations for incorporating assessment instruments in biology instruction and assessment are provided.

AB All teachers hope that students learn to apply and analyze, rather than simply memorize or parrot back, the teacher's words. One method of encouraging the development of students' higher-level thinking skills is to give learners practice in identifying appropriate analogies for biological concepts, and in forming their own. Analogies focus on the larger concepts we are trying to teach, rather than specific biological details or actual biological examples. They are fun to practice in class, and this practice prepares students for similar test questions.

TI Comparing the Efficacy of Flipped vs. Alternative Active Learning in a
   College Genetics Course
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English

DE Flipped learning; active learning; genetics; higher education
ID STUDENTS
AB Active learning is known to be a key component of student engagement and content mastery. Flipped learning is a pedagogical approach that moves passive, initial instruction out of the classroom (usually as recorded videos) and reserves class time for active-learning exercises that fortify learning. Reports have demonstrated the success of flipped learning, but it is unclear whether that success is due to students watching videos at home (i.e., the "flipped" structure of the flipped classroom) or to the active learning that takes place in class. I sought to answer that question by comparing two sections of sophomore-level college genetics. One section was flipped and the other taught traditionally, but with extensive active learning included as homework. Student satisfaction, performance on quizzes and exams, and overall achievement of course learning goals were compared. Interestingly, after taking into account the diversity of academic strength in both sections, there was no difference between the sections for any of the measured parameters. Although flipped learning may offer no additional benefit over other forms of active learning, it is far easier and more efficient to embed and integrate active learning into a flipped classroom.

AB Based on the life experiences of six prominent environmental voices - Fritjof Capra, David Quammen, Brian McLaren, Douglas Wood, Sylvia Earle, and Louise Chawla - I recommend changes in curriculum content for general science courses, specifically biology courses, to increase the ecological identity of our next generation. Experiences that allowed these individuals to develop an emotional connection to the natural world were an important component of their ecological identity. Coupling outdoor experiences with the development of systemic and ecological thinking skills was also crucial. Changing the science curriculum to reflect more holistic and systemic thinking by integrating with humanities and reflective practices is a necessary step to create a population with a highly developed ecological identity.

AB The common ancestor and evolution by natural selection, concepts introduced by Charles Darwin, constitute the central core of biology research and education. However, students generally struggle to understand these concepts and commonly form misconceptions about them. To help teachers select the most revelant portions of Darwin's work, I suggest some sentences from On the Origin of Species and briefly discuss their implications. I also suggest a teaching strategy that uses history of science and curriculum crosscutting concepts (cause and effect) that constitute the framework to explain the evolutionary history of ratites (flightless birds) as described by Darwin, starting in the Jurassic, with the breakup of Gondwanaland, as first described by Alfred Wegener in The Origin of Continents and Oceans.

AB This exercise utilizes nightcrawler decomposition to guide students through the methods of science, including forming hypotheses, conducting an experiment, statistically analyzing data, and writing a lab report in the style of a scientific journal article. Additionally, students gain experience with dissection, anatomical terminology, and the biological process of animal decomposition. Students interested in forensic science will enjoy exploring the topic of decomposition. The materials for this experiment are inexpensive and easy to obtain, and several extension activities make this a versatile activity that can be used at many different educational levels.

DT Article
DE Ants; attitudes; experience; hands-on; insects; learning enjoyment;
   secondary school; Temnothorax
AB Acorn ants (genus Temnothorax) are a powerful model organism for illustrating the variety of interactions in an ecosystem. We developed five teaching units with acorn ants as the exemplary insect. The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of secondary school students' attitudes before and after teaching units. Students (N = 459) from 22 classes participated in the study. Students' attitudes were measured using a two-stage test design. We investigated the influence of class level, gender, teaching units, and time period of participation on students' attitudes. Additionally, we surveyed a subsample of students on their learning enjoyment in 10-minute interviews. The findings suggest that students' previous investigations with insects in science classes had been few. The results indicate an influence of gender, time period, and the autonomous keeping of ants on attitudes toward the social insects. Although no changes in attitudes were observed for students of lower and higher secondary school, students at the intermediate level had slightly higher attitude scores on the posttest than on the pretest. The majority of students evaluated teaching units positively. Our findings suggest that ant research may offer new opportunities for directing students' attention to native woodland inhabitants.

AB We present a practical field exercise for ecology and animal behavior classes that can be carried out on campus, using urban wildlife. Students document an animal's feeding behavior to study its interactions with the surrounding environment. In this approach, an animal's feeding behavior is quantified at experimental food patches placed within its habitat. Following a lecture on foraging ecology and an outdoor discussion about the animals on campus, students formulate questions and hypotheses. Simple statistical analyses are used to construct results and draw conclusions.

In this exercise, students have the opportunity to observe live chick embryos and stain the apical ectodermal ridge, a key tissue required for development of the vertebrate limb. Impressively, every student who has tried this protocol has been successful, making it a good introduction to the use of the chick model system in studying development. The array of materials about limb development, using chick embryos in teaching laboratories, and the history of this experiment provide a rich background for teachers and students.

ID LITERACY; BIOLOGY
AB I present an activity to help students make the connection between meiosis and genetic variation. The students model meiosis in the first phase of the activity, and by that process they produce gametes of a fictitious reptilobird species, "Chromoseratops meiosus." Later on, they will "mate" their gametes and produce a zygote and a resulting reptilobird. They will determine the phenotype of the resulting reptilobird and draw it. As they compare their reptilobirds, they will be able to see all the resulting variations and to discuss the sources of this variation. This activity can be easily used as a basis for sequel activities that will emphasize the implications of genetic variation on natural and sexual selection.

AB Cultivation of microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria is often not included in scientific inquiries conducted in school because of the difficulty of manufacturing a suitable medium. A method using dry rehydratable film to reduce the need to manufacture a suitable medium and shorten incubation time was developed as an efficient microbial testing method. Using this method, students can easily perform experiments on microorganisms in schools where time and space are limited. For example, we carried out an inquiry on the possibility of drinking refrigerated milk that is already past its expiration date. Through this activity, we could raise issues related to the current shelf-life labeling system implemented in Korea. In addition, the method can measure microorganisms in several ways through air, direct contact, and indirect contact, making the procedure easier to use in scientific activities at school.

AB Writing-to-learn (WTL) is an effective instructional and learning strategy that centers on the process of organizing and articulating ideas, as opposed to writing-to-communicate, which centers on the finished written product. We describe a WTL model that we have developed and tested with various student groups over several years. With effective instructor guidance (through prompts and in-class discussion), students demonstrated greater scientific literacy after participating in writing activities about engaging socio-scientific issues. We believe that WTL activities are underused in secondary and post-secondary biology courses.

Students develop their ability to identify macroinvertebrates, compare aquatic fauna from different sources of water samples, evaluate water quality using an index, document and analyze data, raise questions and hypotheses, and discuss other possible issues that could be investigated at a later time. These sets of activities were designed for freshman high school students but are applicable to middle school students as well.

AB We propose a procedure for the assay of fermentation in yeast in microcentrifuge tubes that is simple and rapid, permitting assay replicates, descriptive statistics, and the preparation of line graphs that indicate reproducibility. Using regression and simple derivatives to determine initial velocities, we suggest methods to compare the effects of experimental variables. This technique is straightforward enough to facilitate design of an inquiry lab based on a scenario that explores modifications to enhance the rate of fermentation.

AB We describe a laboratory exercise developed for the cell and molecular biology quarter of a year-long majors' undergraduate introductory biology sequence. In an analysis of salmon samples collected by students in their local stores and restaurants, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to detect market substitution of Atlantic salmon for Pacific salmon. This allowed students to apply molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing to a socially relevant issue.

AB Epigenetics is emerging as one of the most dynamic and vibrant biomedical areas. Multiple lines of evidence confirm that inherited genetic changes alone cannot fully explain all phenotypic characteristics of live organisms, and additional factors, which are not encoded in the DNA sequence, are involved. The contribution of non-genetic factors is perhaps best illustrated by monozygotic twins, which, despite sharing nearly identical DNA sequences, are often discordant for diseases they develop. Even when twins develop the same condition, they may experience different clinical manifestations or clinical onset at different ages. Epigenetic mechanisms explain how a zygote can differentiate into >220 different cell types that form an adult organism and, with rare exceptions, share the same DNA. Increasingly, epigenetic factors emerge, in addition to genetic ones, as important contributors to carcinogenesis. Epigenetic modifications also explain the biological impact of environmental factors, including chemical and dietary compounds, physical agents, pathogens linked to cancer, and social-emotional interactions. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes are reversible, a characteristic that opens unprecedented therapeutic avenues, exemplified by the first epigenetic drugs that were recently approved. Understanding the combined contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to gene expression will be essential to dissect the biological networks shaping development and disease, and to develop a new array of prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications.

TI Darwin's Error: Using the Story of Pangenesis to Illustrate Aspects of
   Nature of Science in the Classroom
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE History of science; Charles Darwin; heredity; nature of science
AB This article discusses a number of aspects of the nature of science that can be illustrated by considering the development of pangenesis, a principle proposed by Charles Darwin to describe the rules of inheritance, explain the source of new variation, and solve other natural history puzzles. Pangenesis - although false - can be used to illustrate important nature of science ideas such as the need for empirical evidence, the use of inductive reasoning, the creative component of science, the role of bias and subjectivity, social and personal influences on science, and the notion that scientific knowledge is tentative but durable, yet self correcting.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Confirmation bias; controlled experiments; double-blind experiments;
   empirical data; observations; optical illusions; pheromones;
   repeatability; synaesthesia
AB Science requires the acquisition and analysis of empirical (sense-derived) data. Given the same physical objects or phenomena, the sense organs of all people do not respond equally to these stimuli, nor do their minds interpret sensory signals identically. Therefore, teachers should develop lectures on human sensory systems that include some common examples of sensory limitations, variations, deficiencies, malfunctions, and diseases (as discussed herein) because they have important implications for conducting scientific investigations, science education, and introspection that are seldom included in biology textbooks. Students need to be made aware of the human tendency to self deception in order to avoid the cognitive error of confirmation bias.

AB The accumulation of plastic in the oceans is an ever-growing environmental concern. Plastic debris is a choking and entanglement hazard for wildlife; plastics also leach toxic compounds into organisms and ecosystems. Educating students about the marine debris problem introduces fundamental concepts in toxicology, ecology, and oceanography. Students will learn about the toxicity of plastics, collect and analyze data on plastic debris, and put their new knowledge to work by writing a congressional bill that addresses the problem of marine debris.

AB Immersive experiences contribute to and enhance diverse curricula. Although more commonly applied to language curricula, student travel has much to offer science courses as well. Here, several options are described for secondary and college-level biology courses to participate in field-based study. The experience of one high school with one Amazonian field station is considered in detail, and several alternative opportunities for science-based student travel are provided as well. Traveling to the Amazon as an extension of classroom-based hypothesis generation and experimental design contextualized content for one high school biology course in a way that is powerful and repeatable.

AB Fostering science literacy by engaging students as active participants and communicators of scientific ideas can enhance learning as well as a sense of personal investment. Science "zine" projects can be an effective way to structure this kind of participatory science literacy and flexibly build on specific course content as well as skills in the research, conceptualization, and communication of scientific ideas. When students are engaged as media producers and educators, their role and responsibility in the "ecology of scientific information" becomes more apparent and potentially more rewarding.

The results indicated a strong tendency toward student funding of applied medical research at the expense of basic research. Exposure to a few examples of important basic research moderates this tendency.

AB At a time when all course instruction had been moved online, it seemed wishful thinking for a group of undergraduate students to begin authentic, independent research. With curious, creative, and motivated mindsets; however, we learned not only that such research was possible during a global pandemic, but that it could provide vital learning opportunities in our careers as students and scientists. Guided by mentors of UW-Madison's honors biology Biocore program, we worked as a team of three undergraduate scientists and were given significant autonomy over all aspects of our research project. We planned, conducted, and communicated our science and here we provide a commentary of our learning throughout the process, as well as recommendations for instructors of other undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math programs based on the factors that best facilitated our learning.

AB Evolution by natural selection and adaptation are core concepts in biology that students must see and correctly understand their meaning. However, using these concepts in evidence-based learning strategies in the classroom is a difficult task. Here, we present a 5E lesson plan to address the Next Generation Science Standards performance expectation HS-LS4-4, to "construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations." The Functional Frogs lesson provides multiple hands-on activities to engage students in the development of hypotheses, collection and analysis of empirical data on frog swimming, presentation of results, and construction of explanations supported by evidence for the results. The lesson's central idea is for students to understand the trait values that provide an advantage in the aquatic environment, increasing a frog's survival. The link between morphological changes and survival is used to explain how natural selection acts on populations, leading to adaptive evolution.

DE writing assignments; compare and contrast; biology
AB Writing is a high-impact tool that is often used to improve student learning, success, and critical thinking. Science courses typically implement writing in the form of laboratory and/or research reports. To extend the use of writing and use it as a tool to learn biology, both in-class/informal and out-of-class/formal writing assignments were designed. All the assignments focused on two important skills biology students are expected to gain: To compare and contrast biological processes and present and defend an argument. The assignments were implemented throughout the semester with a final, cumulative out-of-class assignment to give students an opportunity to review whole class material. The assignments were used in in-person, hybrid, and online General Biology I course at a community college. These assignments can be used as is, modified by the instructor, or used as preparation for valuable classroom debates.

AB Through the artistic planning tool known to comic book artists and animators as storyboarding, students will embark on comic book-style adventures to plan, describe, and visualize the complex life of genes through the non-Mendelian concept of epistasis. Using storyboard templates, conceptual layouts, sketch booking, and cut-out genetic elements, students will construct their interpretation of the gene-gene interactions of epistasis. The incomplete story of the epistasis of human eye color will serve as the theme for this storyboard, which will also become its own assessment tool, inviting educators into a realm of a true STEAM experience.

AB Teaching ecological concepts and field methods for introductory biology courses can be challenging, especially when class sizes are large and activities or topics depend on environmental conditions that can change dramatically from semester to semester. We provide a laboratory module that can be used throughout the year, where students can explore plant-insect interactions on campus trees in urban environments using nondestructive measures. Students are provided a transparent grid, a measuring tape, and a random selection protocol to estimate gloomy scale (Melanaspis tenebricosa) insect density on preselected Acer rubrum tree trunks. Students are also given a pace-to-plant protocol to evaluate how impervious surfaces around trees in urban environments may be associated with scale insect abundance. This module highlights ecological concepts, such as population dynamics, species interactions, competition, and food webs, among others. Through this module, students also learn skills in ecological field sampling techniques, particularly how to randomly sample, how to estimate insect abundance, and how to use observation skills to inform scientific inquiry.

AB The concepts of osmosis and diffusion are essential to biology; and student difficulties with them are well documented, along with multiple ways of assessment and diagnosis. We add to the literature by sharing how we used drawing and reasoning prompts with first-year undergraduate biology students to gauge learning before and after an osmosis and diffusion lab. We also share the development and validation of a three-point analytical rubric to score the keywords, student drawings, and reasoning prompts. The qualitative and quantitative nature of this exercise provides instructors with the unique opportunity to diagnose difficulties not only in introductory biology but throughout the undergraduate curriculum. Implementation strategies throughout the undergraduate curriculum are discussed.

ID INQUIRY-BASED SCIENCE
AB Plastic pollution is ubiquitous and there is growing concern about its consequences. Given that current research findings often reach the public insufficiently, the issue should be addressed at school. To create a fruitful learning experience, we propose three associated hands-on, inquiry-based learning activities that require little equipment. Students learn about the origins and properties of plastics, investigate everyday sources, learn about recycling, address and reflect upon the material's (dis)advantages, and are encouraged to consider solutions. All activities align with the Next Generation Science Standards and are primarily designed for the middle school classroom; we further provide modifications for elementary and high school settings.

AB Hands-on, inquiry-based laboratory activities are excellent opportunities to introduce first-year undergraduate students to the lab environment and to catalyze new interest in topics they may not yet know or be as enthusiastic about studying. We describe a multisession introductory laboratory activity that couples the research areas of medicinal drug discovery and plant biology. Selecting from a diversity of native California plants and broadly recognized medicinal plants, students learn and apply an assortment of basic phytochemical assays, analyze preliminary data, and then formulate hypothesis-driven follow-up experiments. Working in small groups, students develop shared project management and collaboration skills, and present activity results to peers in multiple modalities. Furthermore, we summarize findings from 163 student experiments using 29 plant species into an Instructor's Resource Table to facilitate guiding students through their preliminary and follow-up experiments. Lastly, we include student responses from pre- and post-activity surveys on their changing attitudes toward plant biology.

AB In an age-appropriate activity developed by a researcher-teacher team working together under the auspices of the American Chemical Science Coaches Program, middle school students at the Greensboro Montessori School (1) learned about the microbiological basis of fermentation, (2) learned about the chemical changes that take place during the fermentation of milk into yogurt, (3) applied this basic knowledge to designing and implementing experiments to test different conditions for culturing yogurt, (4) assessed the outcomes of different culturing conditions, and (5) developed a method for producing yogurt. This exercise includes hypothesis formulation, experimental design, and hypothesis testing and serves as an example of how empirically derived knowledge can be applied to the design of a food product.

DE Soil; enzymes; antibiotics; Streptomyces; bacterial diversity
AB Microbial biodiversity and its rich arsenal of natural products is an important and complex biological concept. We propose the use of Streptomyces, one of the most diverse bacterial genera and a major inhabitant of soil, as a model to explain the relevance and importance of this concept. Students will perform experiments ranging from isolation and selection of Streptomyces species, to performing fungal and bacterial challenge assays to evaluate their biocontrol capacity, to screening for specialized metabolic properties such as the production of lipases, amylases, and cellulases. Accompanied by active discussions on the experimental process and results, and integrated into the general microbiology curriculum, this real-life discovery-based lab exercise engages students in current topics concerning natural product discovery and reinforces their understanding of several important concepts in microbiology and biotechnology.

AB We describe a structured inquiry-based lesson about the human ear and sound that can lead to long-term retention of content knowledge and reduce the gender gap in science subjects. The lesson integrates the subjects of biology and physics for students about 15 years of age and is suitable with high or low pre-knowledge and for both genders equally. Students learn in hands-on experiments about sound formation and properties; the human outer, middle, and inner ear; and limits to human hearing, both natural and resulting from damage to the inner ear. This lesson is suitable for beginners in inquiry-based learning and teaching. It is designed as structured/level 1 inquiry-based science. The topic and how it is analyzed is provided by the teacher in the lesson material, but students are strongly invited to actively think about why they expect certain results to happen and how the results can be interpreted.

ID PHOSPHATE AVAILABILITY; SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
AB This lab gives students hands-on experience with visualizing the root architecture of plants exposed to varying concentrations of the vital nutrient phosphorus. By maintaining Brassica sp. seedlings in the presence of different quantities of phosphate, students am quantify changes in the number of lateral roots as an example of how the environment influences plant pattern formation. Additional variables in the experimental design, such as the use of plant mutants altered in plant regulator action or the presence of plant regulators in the plant growth medium, allow for exploration of how plant growth regulators are involved in root development. The quantitative and qualitative nature of this nine-day activity provides instructors opportunities to introduce students to various data analyses in botanical study. Additional ties to plant anatomy and the agricultural use of plant growth regulators that alter root development make this activity a rich source of exploration for broadening student exposure to plants and their development.

AB We describe a series of engaging exercises in which students emulate the process that researchers use to efficiently develop new pharmaceutical drugs, that of rational drug design. The activities are taken from a three- to four-hour workshop regularly conducted with first-year college students and presented here to take place over three to four class periods. Although targeted at college students, these activities may be appropriate at the high school level as well, particularly in an AP Biology course. The exercises introduce students to the topics of bioinformatics and computer modeling, in the context of rational drug design, using free online resources such as databases and computer programs. Through the process of learning about computational drug design and drug optimization, students also learn content such as elements of protein structure and protein-ligand interactions. Based on our assessment, students enjoy the exercises, become more interested in bioinformatics and computer modeling, and demonstrate an increase in content knowledge relevant to the topics.

AB Only about half of Americans are convinced that human activity is the major cause of climate change. This statistic highlights the increased need for high-quality climate science education but also highlights the fact that lessons on this subject are often complicated as denial argumentation abounds in classrooms. In order to achieve greater efficacy of and receptivity to climate science instruction, I propose the inclusion of lessons on the nature of science and the reframing of lessons in terms of risk management.

   analysis; heat fixation; live cells
AB In educational and research settings, Tetrahymena is an excellent model organismfor engaging students to investigate function, morphology, structure, phagocytosis, and ciliary motion. Here, we present applications of Wright stain and Sytox green as useful low-cost tools for phenotypic analysis. We used heat-fixed Tetrahymena followed by Wright-stain-labeled organelles at different stages of its life cycle. In addition, a low concentration of Wright stain, at 1 percent (vol/vol), enabled visualization of filled vacuoles with stain in live Tetrahymena. Furthermore, we identified that Sytox green fluorescence labels not only nuclei of pre-incubated cultures of Tetrahymena, but also nuclei and some notable cytoplasmic staining after heat fixation. These applications can be used alongside inverted, battery-operated, bright field, fluorescence microscopes (Miller et al., 2010), as well as Cellcams (Martin & Shin, 2016) for acquiring images and time-lapse movies. In the future, these useful approaches can be applied broadly in many lab inquiry settings, such as toxicology and molecular genetics.

AB Insects provide an excellent model for examining concepts in endocrinology in the classroom. They are relatively inexpensive to rear, short-lived, and free from animal welfare regulations. Using the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) as a model, we have developed a simple laboratory experiment to demonstrate the role of hormones in development. In this experiment, students will use a readily available agonist to disrupt insect development, preventing metamorphosis. This exercise fits well into the AP lab curriculum and the NGSS LSB. 1 objectives.

   transformation; misconceptions; active learning; simulation
AB Undergraduate introductory biology students at the university level often struggle to trace movement of matter and energy through catabolic and anabolic processes in biological systems. A sequential guided simulation of cellular respiration and photosynthesis provides students an opportunity to actively model and visualize matter transformation and energy accumulation and degradation through the movement of molecular and energy "game pieces." The activity was designed to help students generate a simplified outline of these two highly complex processes, while reinforcing the principles of conservation of matter and energy. My students participated in this activity during peer-led review sessions in an undergraduate, introductory, majors biology course (ca. 150 students in 18 SI sessions over two semesters), but instructors could also easily adapt it for use in small lecture or laboratory classrooms, introductory cell biology, physiology, and ecology courses, or with high school students.

AB Many high school and undergraduate students enter science courses feeling intimidated by course content and unsure of their abilities. Teachers are frequently challenged in mixed-level and interdisciplinary courses to ascertain and honor students' levels and areas of experience. In these cases, the application of critical pedagogy techniques can create a culture of caring and thereby allay student anxiety and increase student motivation and success. Here I describe a simple instant polling exercise that employs critical pedagogy to stimulate dialogue about students' experiences with course content. This exercise is especially useful for mixed-level and interdisciplinary science courses, and can be easily adapted for small or large classes.

AB Territoriality and the factors that influence the outcome of animal contests are easy to study in a lab using convict cichlid fish (Archocentrus nigrofasciatus). I present a two-week laboratory experiment suitable for high school and college students. In the first week, students observe resident and intruder convict cichlids interacting in the presence of flowerpot territories, allowing them to develop hypotheses about factors that might determine the outcome of contests over resources, including relative size of competitors ("resource holding potential" hypothesis) and ownership ("resource value" hypothesis). They then work with their teacher to design and set up an experiment to test these two hypotheses, providing specific predictions that would support each hypothesis. In the second week, students observe contests between each owner and a larger or smaller intruder. The winner is defined as the individual that spends the most time in the pot and bites more. Students graph their data and decide what statistics are most appropriate for analyzing their results. They determine which hypothesis is supported by their findings and present their findings in scientific paper format.

AB Although animal dissection is common in classrooms, growing concerns for animal welfare and advances in nonanimal teaching methods have prompted the creation of policies that allow students to choose humane alternatives to classroom animal use. We assessed the prevalence and content of policies that allow students to opt out of animal dissection in states and large public school districts across the United States - data that have not previously been collected or analyzed. We found that such policies exist at the state level in 22 states (plus the District of Columbia) and in many large public school districts in the other remaining states. These data illustrate that at least 63% of students in U.S. public schools have access to some kind of dissection choice, although the content of these policies varies widely. We discuss these results and recommend components of a comprehensive student dissection-choice policy.

AB This article features a four-step pedagogical framework that can be used to transform the undergraduate biology laboratory into an authentic research experience. The framework utilizes a four-step scaffolding structure that not only guides students through the process of science and helps them gain mastery of relevant scientific practices, but also simplifies and streamlines the instructor's process of designing and implementing an authentic research experience in a biology lab course. We used this pedagogical framework to design an authentic research experience in which students investigated various factors affecting the growth and viability of a mammalian cell line, Vero cells isolated from kidney epithelial cells extracted from an African green monkey. Although this particular lab was designed for a cell and molecular biology course for university sophomores, the flexibility built into the pedagogical framework allows it to be used to design research experiences that can be implemented within a wide variety of lab courses at varying levels, effectively increasing the amount of authentic research experiences in biology lab courses nationwide.

AB We present a simple strategy that professors and research students can use to coordinate scientific education-outreach programs in the wider community. The focal points of this strategy are the use of preexisting community networks and the development of a simple but engaging educational program. Employing this straightforward model can help reduce the activation barrier for lab members who are interested in becoming involved in scientific outreach.

AB We designed a course based on inquiry learning using WISE, an online inquiry-based science environment platform, and the 5E instructional model. This article summarizes guidelines used in designing the course, analyses of student needs and school environment, setting of course objectives, modification of materials, and evaluation of student performance. A "Healthy Life" course based on those guidelines was implemented, along with a teacher-training workshop, in two schools, and pretests and posttests were administered to evaluate the achievements of the project participants. The results showed that the participants had constructed scientific concepts and improved their level of cognitive knowledge. An efficiency questionnaire and semistructured interviews demonstrated the effectiveness of the course, thus indicating that we should share the guidelines and features of the Healthy Life course with other course designers and teachers.

AB Active learning exercises can help students understand and remember complex, three-dimensional processes. By modeling molecular processes with their bodies, students gain an appreciation for the three-dimensional nature of these processes and the physical sequence of events that constitute them. The exercises presented here focus on DNA replication and the translation of mRNA into amino acid sequences, multistep processes that require specific series of events. The exercises help students appreciate the spatial and temporal frameworks of these essential cellular functions. They can be incorporated into classes when these concepts are introduced or used as review exercises for exams.

DT Article
DE Giving-up density; predation; competition; optimal foraging theory
ID PREDATION-RISK; PREFERENCE; SQUIRREL
AB Optimal foraging theory explains that organisms whose foraging is as energetically efficient as possible should be favored by natural selection. However, many individuals must exhibit trade-offs between foraging and other factors in their environment (i.e., predation risk, competitive interactions). We present a hands-on activity for undergraduates using just a deck of cards, bingo chips, and dice to introduce ecological concepts of foraging theory, predator-prey interactions, and energy trade-offs. Specifically, this activity will focus on optimal foraging theory and giving-up density. Students should gain an understanding of how organisms balance predation risk and competitive interactions with energetic demands. Further, this activity can be scaled for nonmajors and introductory courses to introduce general ecological concepts, or for upper-division courses to explore advanced topics in foraging theory.

AB Teachers are being challenged to engage students in ways that will elevate student interest and understanding of concepts in science and encourage students to gather evidence to support what we know about science. It is critical for teachers to have budget-friendly, supporting activities that are aligned with current educational standards, that are easy to present, and that incorporate a variety of skills important to the study of science. This simulation activity is an inexpensive exercise that challenges students to hypothesize the evolutionary outcome of genotype selection in a population and then gather and analyze a set of unique data. Connections to recent evolutionary changes in familiar organisms ground the activity for students, helping them grasp the importance of such investigative work.

AB The molecular basis of evolution is an important concept to understand but one that students and teachers often find challenging. This article provides training and guidance for teachers on how to present molecular evolution concepts so that students will associate molecular changes with the evolution of form and function in organisms. Included are examples that illustrate how mutation followed by selection causes populations to evolve. Next month we will share lab activities that illustrate the concepts and reinforce the complementary roles of mutation and selection in the overall process of evolution.

DE Organogenesis; lumopathies; heart; kidney; stenosis; hydronephrosis
AB A major challenge in teaching organ development and disease is deconstructing a complex choreography of molecular and cellular changes over time into a linear stepwise process for students. As an entry toward learning developmental concepts, I propose two inexpensive hands-on activities to help facilitate learning of (1) how to identify defects in heart and kidneys and (2) what evolutionarily conserved strategies from organ development can be applied to understand how to repair these defects. The ease of assembling these activities, combined with traffic flow as a metaphor for physiological function of heart and kidneys, provides students the opportunity to explore and discover biological concepts in organ formation and disease.

DE Post-secondary and adult learning; andragogy; transformational learning;

AB It has become apparent through the work of many researchers and practitioners that adults learn differently than their younger counterparts in the educational system. This is especially important to those educators teaching in colleges and universities in the sciences. Biology education in the post-secondary setting is inundated with teachers who know biology backward and forward but lack the skills to effectively teach that knowledge to others. By applying the theories of andragogy, transformational learning, and experiential learning, and by integrating practices of self-directed learning and critical reflection, we can improve the effectiveness of biology education in American colleges and universities.

DE Biological order; second law; DNA; open system
AB By growth in size and complexity (i.e., changing from more probable to less probable states), plants and animals appear to defy the second law of thermodynamics. The usual explanation describes the input of nutrient and sunlight energy into open thermodynamic systems. However, energy input alone does not address the ability to organize and create complex structures or explain life cycles - in particular, growth regulation and dying in the presence of adequate nutrients. Understanding the roles of macromolecules such as DNA, with their apparent information-processing capability, affords opportunity to understand biological order.

AB Analytical and quantitative thinking skills are core components of science but can be challenging to teach in introductory biology courses. To address this issue, modest curriculum modifications, including methods of hypothesis testing, data collection, and statistical analysis, were introduced into existing exercises in an introductory biology laboratory course. After completing the updated course, students demonstrated improved ability to understand and interpret statistical analyses. Furthermore, students were more likely to understand that hypothesis development and quantitative data analysis are important parts of biology. This study indicates that small changes to laboratory curricula can effect important changes in student learning and attitudes.

AB A continuing challenge in life-science education is to foster student engagement with complex, occasionally dry material. One approach to this challenge is to build connections between classroom topics and the "real world." We outline here an active-learning assignment in which students write to a local representative concerning a current social or environmental problem. In their letters, students present the scientific basis of the problem, evaluate opposing viewpoints, and describe their own science-based recommendation. This assignment empowers students by recognizing their ability to build connections and contribute insight. By fostering student engagement and interdisciplinary understanding, this can be a useful and exciting complement to classroom learning.

AB In this activity, groups of students assume the roles of human body organs. They work together to acquire the knowledge needed to develop a skit to "act out" the argument that their selected organ is the most important one in the body. The students learn and reinforce their understanding of the composition and functions of organs and organ systems and how they interrelate to allow for the survival of the body as a whole while maintaining homeostasis throughout life.

AB How can science instruction help students and teachers engage in relevant genetics content that stimulates learning and heightens curiosity? Project-based science can enhance learning and thinking in science classrooms. We describe how we use project-based science features as a framework for a genetics unit, discuss some of the challenges encountered, and provide suggestions for enactment. This serves as an example of how project-based approaches can be integrated into high school science classrooms.

AB The United States still has one of the lowest evolution acceptance rates in the world. Biology educators have been diligent in their methods to increase evolution acceptance and knowledge, with much success. However, misconceptions still arise through education, textbooks, and even social and religious settings that may influence our citizens' low evolution acceptance rates. Much research has been done on such misconceptions. But with new technology and electronic advances, we now have a wide variety of information available at our fingertips. Advents such as social media, popular culture, and smart devices may incorporate new and unique misconceptions not seen before in evolution education. We see a younger generation raised in an era where they may experience a bombardment of evolution misconceptions daily, from the games they play to the posts or memes they read on social media. Research into these effects is lacking but may be essential to push the boundaries of evolution education into the future.

ID INTERFERENCE
AB Gene expression plays a pivotal role in the development, differentiation, and maintenance of organisms by allowing genes to encode for an observable trait (i.e., phenotype). To understand the function of a particular gene, several approaches can be taken, ranging from removing the gene entirely to targeting the product of the gene (i.e., the protein). RNA interference (RNAi) has been shown to be a powerful approach used to silence gene activity and examine the connection between DNA and protein along with controlling gene expression. The course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) described in this article is a hands-on molecular biology lab-based lesson that allows students to examine the impact of RNAi on Caenorhabditis elegans reproduction and development through the examination of the central dogma of biology. Through these activities, students gain practice in the scientific method of inquiry by designing experiments to observe how genotype connects to phenotype and, subsequently, organism behavior.

AB The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of the 5E model on the understanding of the molecular genetics concepts taught in general biology. The research had a quantitative focus and a quasi-experimental design, and the participants were 40 undergraduate students from a private university in the west of Puerto Rico, which were divided in two control groups and one experimental group. The initial data was obtained through a pretest that measured the understanding of molecular genetics concepts. The treatment lasted six weeks and consisted of the instruction of the topics of DNA structure and replication, transcription, translation, and mutations. The after-instruction understanding of the concepts was evaluated through a posttest. The results showed that the 5E model had a significant effect (p < 0.05) in generating a higher understanding of the concepts presented.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are one way instructors can increase engagement and learning of material. One of the goals in the report Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action is to increase active learning activities. By implementing a CURE or CURE-type model, instructors provide students with the opportunity to develop a better understanding of science content, to apply what they have learned, and make an impact in real-world science. Our classes replicated a subset of the work being completed in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. We had students complete biodiversity surveys through collection and classification of ant species using field and lab techniques. DNA barcoding analyses are commonly used techniques in biology labs worldwide. Polymerase chain reaction and cycle sequencing will be taught to illustrate how the extracted DNA can be amplified at different markers and used to identify species. We utilized the CURE model to have students complete a biodiversity survey of both a southern intermountain-west and a southeastern state through collection, classification, and genotyping and barcoding of ant species.

Using qualitative methods, we explored the relationships between undergraduate students engaged in research and their mentors in faculty-led laboratories, with particular attention to the roles that mentors play in the enculturation of undergraduates into science. Students rarely considered faculty as their primary mentors, rather whomever they spent the most time or worked most closely with--usually a graduate student or postdoc. There was a large disparity between women and men students identifying as scientists, and in the criteria by which they claim science identity. However, nearly all faculty members considered undergraduate researchers as scientists. This suggests that faculty members might boost the science identity of -undergraduate women by simply calling them scientists.

AB Inquiry-driven teaching methods allow students to take on an active role in their own education. Through this framework, students are able to cultivate an understanding of scientific concepts and their connections while experimenting in the classroom. Our project centered around teaching students about habitats of urban moths, which are abundant in most environments. Based on the students' hypotheses on where moths might be, homemade moth traps were placed either in a local nature preserve or in the school playground over the course of two nights. Overall, 27 moths were captured. Students then learned how to pin moth specimens and assessed what they could infer from how many moths were captured in each of the collection areas. This project created an environment for students to approach Next Generation Science Standards performance expectations about the diversity of life and how organisms interact with their environments.

AB Computer simulations provide students the opportunity to observe and interact in realistic biological experiences. This designed simulation, "The Trio of Genetic Diversity," made it easier for students to grasp the reasons for genetic diversity. During and after meiosis, the three processes (crossing over, independent assortment, and random fertilization) that occur are the primary sources of diversity. A separate module was designed for each of the three processes and presented in the order of occurrence. It will take three to five minutes for student to try each module. The simulation in this study was developed using Java programming language in the NetBeans IDE 8.2 development environment, along with the Swing GUI module. Java was used in the simulation so that it can be run easily in almost every operating system; furthermore, the interface is included in the Java library. The NetBeans IDE 8.2 software allowed the simulations to show the range of possibilities for genetic diversity. Chromosome images were created and converted into a transparent structure, and the coding process was started. The images and button actions in the simulation interface were carefully designed so that the user could understand them easily. This article introduces the simulation program and its features.

DE cellular respiration; modeling; photosynthesis
AB Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are core concepts in high school biology, as they are at the core of all living things. However, perhaps because students can't see them happening, they very often have difficulty understanding them. Further, students often come into biology with a limited understanding of the law of conservation of matter as it relates to chemical reactions. These problems compound to create a great deal of misconceptions about these two important processes. In these lessons, I implemented the use of modeling to overcome these misconceptions and give my students a firm understanding of chemical equations, photosynthesis, and cellular respiration.

AB Timeline Challenge (https://timelinechallenge.hudsonalpha.org) engages students in a Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) task while they investigate critical advances in agriculture and biotechnology. This freely available digital resource scaffolds students' investigation of biotechnology by presenting a current and ongoing agricultural problem. The Timeline Challenge utilizes the Progress of Science biotechnology time-line as the backdrop for a series of agriculture-based challenges, such as producing meatier chickens, non-browning apples, or perennial wheat. This web-based module allows students to choose a specific biotech tool to address the challenge and then compare their plan to ongoing modern research related to the challenge. Along the way, students are presented with a real-world complication to encourage thinking about the problem from multiple perspectives.

AB The recent discovery of radiocarbon in dinosaur bones at first seems incompatible with an age of millions of years, due to the short half-life of radiocarbon. However, evidence from isotopes other than radiocarbon shows that dinosaur fossils are indeed millions of years old. Fossil bone incorporates new radiocarbon by means of recrystallization and in some cases, bacterial activity and uranium decay. Because of this, bone mineral - fossil or otherwise - is a material that cannot yield an accurate radiocarbon date except under extraordinary circumstances. Mesozoic bone consistently yields a falsely young radiocarbon "date" of a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years, despite the fact that it is millions of years old. Science educators need to be aware of the details of these phenomena, to be able to advise students whose acceptance of biological evolution has been challenged by young-Earth creationist arguments that are based on radiocarbon in dinosaur fossils.

AB A feature of science is its production of evidence-based explanations. Scientific models can both provide causal explanations and be predictive of natural phenomena. Modeling-based inquiry (MBI) is a pedagogical strategy that promotes students' deep learning about phenomena via engagement in authentic scientific practices. Some university instructors have begun to facilitate MBI in their courses, notably those aimed at aspiring K-12 science educators who, per the Next Generation Science Standards, are encouraged to implement MBI. Yet exploration of curriculum and teaching with MBI in postsecondary environments is scarce. We detail a novel MBI curriculum implemented in a postsecondary ecology course that included students interested in future careers in education. The curriculum engages students in modeling why there is greater biological diversity in tropical than in temperate regions. This biological phenomenon continues to be of great interest to the scientific community. We briefly detail how the curriculum impacted students' understanding of participation in aspects of scientific practices and their comfort with facilitating MBI.

AB Interactions are at the core of many ecological and evolutionary forces in nature. Plant-soil interactions provide a rich example of the interconnectedness of living systems, but they are hidden from everyday view and overshadowed in the classroom by more popular teaching examples involving animals, reptiles, or invertebrates. To highlight the importance and relevance of plant-soil relationships, we devised a simple role-playing activity suitable for college students. Specifically, the activity simulates how feedbacks between plants and soil environments influence plant species abundance and community richness. With this activity, students will gain a better understanding of these prolific, but overlooked, forms of biological interactions that impact the diversity and functioning of ecosystems.

TI The Innovative Use of Mathematica to Teach Biodiversity
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE biodiversity; inquiry; technology; mathematical reasoning; ecology
AB We investigated using Mathematica to create an interactive exercise that allows students to explore biological concepts. Exporting these active learning experiences to the Wolfram Computable Document Format (CDF) lets students enter data and modify parameters with only a browser plug-in and without needing to know how to use Mathematica. This exercise enhances student understanding by allowing them to focus on the biological concepts and visualize the data and calculations without the tedium of hand computation. In this article, we will highlight an interactive version of a biodiversity laboratory that explores Simpson's Diversity Index. Students are walked through sample calculations with a small data set, and then analyze a larger data set, which is presented as a set of interactive graphs and automatic calculations so that they can explore the data to answer questions. For our non-major audience, this laboratory leads to a more sophisticated discussion without getting stuck on the calculations. We will present the exercise and assessment results.

   Biology and Physiology Laboratory Using the Chick Embryonic Heart
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE authentic research; heart development; chicken embryo; developmental
   biology laboratory; physiology laboratory; undergraduate research
ID INQUIRY
AB The lab presented in this paper utilizes a proven four-step pedagogical framework (McLaughlin & Coyle, 2016) to redesign a classic Association of Biology Laboratory Education (ABLE) undergraduate lab (McLaughlin & McCain, 1999) into an authentic research experience on vertebrate four-chambered heart development and physiology. The model system is the chicken embryo. Through their research, students are also exposed to the embryonic anatomy and physiology of the vertebrate heart, the electrical circuitry of the developing heart, and the effects of pharmacological drugs on heart rate and contractility. Classical embryological micro-techniques, explantation of the embryo, surgical removal of the beating heart, isolation of the heart chambers, and more advanced tissue culture methods are also conducted. In this laboratory paradigm, students work in pairs to ask their own questions concerning the effects of two human cardiovascular drugs, denopamine (TM) and acebutolol (TM) on both in vivo and in vitro chicken embryonic heart rate and contractility, develop testable hypotheses based on information gathered from relevant scientific literature, devise and carry out a controlled experiment, and present the data in a professional scientific manner pertaining to a topic of clinical significance.

ID LIFE-STYLE INTERVENTION
AB A Socratic seminar can be a powerful tool for increasing students' ability to analyze and interpret data. Most commonly used for text-based discussion, we found that using Socratic seminar to engage students with data contributes to student understanding by allowing them to reason through and process complex information as a group. This approach also provides teachers with insights about student misconceptions and understanding of concepts by listening to the student-driven discussion. This article reports on Socratic seminar in the context of a high school type 2 diabetes curriculum that explores gene and environment interactions. A case study illustrates how Socratic seminar is applied in a classroom and how students engage with the process. General characteristics of Socratic seminar are discussed at the end of the article.

ID TEMPERATURE; MALARIA; DYNAMICS; SPREAD
AB Global climate change will affect all living things on this planet. For many species, the change in their environment may mean extinction. However, there is one organism, the mosquito, that may benefit from changes in the climate. This paper addresses the possible effects of climate change on mosquitoes, including longer breeding seasons and increased hatch rates of populations. The enlarged population will cause mosquitoes to seek more territory, and the warmer climate will in turn make more territory available. If mosquitoes increase in population, there may be an amplification of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, Chikungunya virus, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile virus, and the Zika virus. This trend of increased range because of climate change has already been observed in dengue fever. This information can be used as an engaging segue into teaching students about climate change and vector-borne disease.

AB Phylogenetics has a central role in the biological sciences. We suggest a hands-on exercise to demonstrate the task of character coding and its importance in phylogenetic systematics. This exercise is appropriate for undergraduate students in life sciences and related courses. The teacher must provide a single group of masks in which color patterns, textures, and formats provide the characters to fill the data matrix. (The masks could be replaced by a set of other complex objects.) In this case, because there is no actual phylogeny, students will not be concerned with recovering the correct topology. Character coding is the aim of the exercise. After the character matrix is completed, a phylogenetic tree is drawn and the students interpret the evolution of a single character, starting from the common ancestor, based on the topological pattern of the tree and on the data matrix. In sequence, the students name and provide a full diagnosis for the group of masks as revealed by the topological pattern. The comparison between group results is also educational: there will be some common patterns between trees, but others will differ as in biological systematics.

ID NATURAL-SELECTION; CONCEPTIONS
AB Introductory biology for nonmajors provides an opportunity to engage students with the complexity of life. In these courses, instructors also have the opportunity to experiment with course material and delivery, especially with an intent to overcome common misconceptions about biology. Fortunately, frameworks exist that can be integrated into a completely novel classroom framework: the AP biology curriculum and the tree of life. In addition, assessments are available that specifically address common misconceptions. I tested whether such a novel approach, covering the four big ideas in biology equally and structured around an accurate depiction of biodiversity as a branching history of evolution, can improve student comprehension of difficult biological concepts. In the end, I found that students improved significantly in their understanding of biology and were much less likely to have common misconceptions about difficult topics.

ID EDUCATION
AB Species identification is essential to biology, conservation, and management. The ability to focus on specific diagnostic characteristics of a species helps improve the speed and accuracy of identification. Birds are excellent subjects for teaching species identification because, in combination with their different shapes and sizes, their plumages have distinctive colors and patterns that vary characteristically from species to species. Bird feather tracts have specific names so that proper descriptions of colors and patterns on those tracts can improve the precision and conciseness of identification criteria. We use popular social media (Twitter) to engage students in an exercise designed to familiarize them with avian species identification and improve their use and comprehension of vocabulary. This exercise can be used in higher education for ornithology and other identification courses, as well as in primary education as a basic introduction to species and biodiversity.

AB We describe an alternative to the kinds of observation-based lab exercises that are often used to cover animal and plant evolution with respect to transitioning from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. We wrote this activity to address these objectives, but also to model the process of scientific inquiry and to require students to collect and analyze quantitative data. Additionally, we designed this activity so that students must consider the evolution of plant and animal traits in an integrated fashion.

AB This study investigates the relationship among (1) college major, (2) knowledge used in reasoning about common health beliefs, and (3) judgment about the accuracy of those beliefs. Seventy-four college students, advanced biology and nonscience majors, indicated their agreement or disagreement with commonly believed, but often inaccurate, statements about health and explained their reasoning. The results indicated that while the direct impact of college-level biology coursework on judgment accuracy was minimal, biology major was associated with increased reliance on advanced biological reasoning, which mediated judgment accuracy. However, the overall association of advanced biological reasoning with judgment accuracy was small. The discussion calls for strengthening the science-daily life connection in biology education for majors and nonmajors.

AB A standard part of biology curricula is a project-based assessment of cell structure and function. However, these are often individual assignments that promote little problem-solving or group learning and avoid the subject of organelle chemical interactions. I evaluate a model-based cell project designed to foster group and individual guided inquiry, and review how the project stimulates problem-solving at a cellular system level. Students begin with four organism cell types, label organelles, describe their structures, and affix chemicals produced or needed for each organelle's function. Students simulate cell signaling, cell recognition, and transport of molecules through membranes. After describing the project, I present measures of student participation and a rubric, compare individual versus group work, and highlight future modifications, including alignment with the Next Generation Science Standard of "Structure, Function, and Information Processing."

The lesson plan provides background information on the hellbender, reviews basic genetics, and exposes students to the scientific process that is used during PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and the analysis of microsatellites in order to calculate allele and genotype frequencies for understanding genetic variability. Once completing the lesson, students should make the connection between molecular research and conservation of a rare, cryptic, and interesting species.

AB In species that reproduce sexually, an individual's fitness depends on its ability to secure a mate (or mates). Although both males and females are selected to maximize their reproductive output, the mating strategies of the two sexes can differ dramatically. We present a classroom simulation that allows undergraduates to actively experience how differences in parental investment lead to differences in reproductive behavior. Students will understand why males generally compete for mates whereas females generally choose among mates. The activity provides a foundation for exploring advanced topics in animal behavior, or it can be adapted for introductory biology courses.

AB The growth of a pine tree is examined by preparing "tree cookies" (cross-sectional disks) between whorls of branches. The use of Christmas trees allows the tree cookies to be obtained with inexpensive, commonly available tools. Students use the tree cookies to investigate the annual growth of the tree and how it corresponds to the number of whorls on the tree. Height-diameter and height-age relationships are also investigated. While aimed at high school classes, the procedure can be adapted for younger students.

DT Article
DE Behavioral ecology; ecology lab exercise; plant-animal interactions
ID HANDLING TIME; DECISIONS
AB We developed an exercise for a university-level ecology class that teaches hypothesis testing by examining acorn preferences and caching behavior of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.). This exercise is easily modified to teach concepts of behavioral ecology for earlier grades, particularly high school, and provides students with a theoretical basis for examining commonly observed squirrel behavior. Students gain experience in testing hypotheses and revising predictions. They evaluate how well predictions of competing hypotheses are supported by statistically analyzing and interpreting class data using t-tests and chi-square tests.

TI Scan & Learn! Use of Quick Response Codes & Smartphones in a Biology
   Field Study
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Teachng biology; biology field study; natural fauna; QR code; smartphone
AB The purpose of this article is to introduce and develop a teaching method and process that incorporates quick response (QR) codes and smartphones into field trips for biology classes. The teaching process using QR codes and smartphones consisted of four steps. The first step was the selection of a suitable field study site and identification of species at the site. For this study, a tidal mudflat in Korea was selected and 24 species were identified at the field site. The second step was the generation by the instructor of QR codes for the 24 species, construction of QR code sheets for the species, and installation of a "QR code decoding app" on students' smartphones. In step 3, students explored and identified species at the field study site using the QR code sheets and shared their results with classmates via a social network system (SNS). The final step was the presentation and discussion of results in follow-up classes. The teaching method developed for this study led to active classroom discussion via smartphone social-networking services. Besides detailing the "scan and learn" teaching method and process, the paper offers a quick checklist for teachers and simplified specifics for the creation of a customized and illustrative field-study guidebook that motivates students.

AB Podcasts (digital audio files) can be utilized creatively to supplement classroom learning. They can be both easily created by instructors and conveniently accessed by students. Students are very receptive to the use of this type of technology as a way to reinforce conceptual understanding of course material. An activity combining a podcast with an active-learning worksheet references the literary classic "The Lord of the Rings" as an analogy to help students understand the many proteins, cells, and processes involved in the human immune response. This activity has helped a significant number of students improve their understanding of this subject.

ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
AB After numerous calls for action, science education within the United States is increasingly moving toward student-centered instructional models that emphasize science as a process and phenomena-based learning. In turn, this shift in instructional practice is driving the need for classroom-tested curricula that develop students' science process skills and engage students in authentic science learning. In this article, we present a set of materials that were used to deliver inquiry-based science instruction for middle school students exploring the impact of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) on human health. Using the highly adaptable zebrafish model organism (Danio rerio), our activities guide students through the process of asking a scientific question, developing and testing a hypothesis, and using evidence to draw conclusions. Finally, we provide recommendations for implementation based on our experience with both in-classroom and distance learning modes of implementation.

AB As the dual crises of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and worsening climate change show, the public must be accurately informed about science. However, many barriers hinder effective messaging about science to the public, including little formal communication training for scientists and an abundance of misleading information from nonscientific sources. Being able to communicate with the public is a vital skill that should be a formal component of scientific training. Here, we synthesize the rationale for incorporating public science communication into undergraduate biology programs and provide specific examples of curriculum efforts to improve undergraduates' skills in this area. We review the literature about the importance of communicating scientific concepts to the public and previous efforts to integrate communication into biology curricula. Next, we provide examples of two courses aimed at developing public science communication skills and describe their integration into an undergraduate biology curriculum. We conclude with future directions and recommendations.

DE parasitology lab; livestream; microscope; online laboratory instruction
AB Teaching biology laboratories remotely presents unique problems and challenges for instructors. Microscopic examination of specimens, as is common in parasitology labs, is especially difficult given the limited quantity of teaching specimens and the need for each student to have access to a microscope at their remote location. Observing images of parasites on the internet coupled with written exercises, while useful, is unrepresentative of real-world laboratory or field conditions. To provide a more realistic microscopy-centered synchronous experience for our parasitology class during the coronavirus pandemic, we used a smartphone mounted on a student microscope to livestream examination of parasite specimens to remote students via the Webex meeting app. This allowed two instructors, working from separate locations, to present and narrate the view of the specimens through the microscope in real time to the remotely located class. While less than ideal, livestreaming microscopic views of parasite specimens together with simultaneous instructor narration provided a reasonable remote substitute for a hands-on parasitology lab experience.

ID IMPACT; WETLAND
AB Ecological succession explored at the secondary and postsecondary level is often limited to terrestrial ecosystems. The emphasis is traditionally placed on how deforestation leads to ecological succession. However, aquatic ecological succession is just as important and allows for many connections to be made with other ecological concepts. Succession initiated by beavers (Castor canadensis) in particular links both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems over time. We present a guide to an inquiry-based lesson for AP Environmental Science and undergraduate ecology courses that explores the effects of aquatic and terrestrial ecological succession initiated by deforestation and beavers. Specifically; the focus is ecological succession and its effects in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this lesson, students (1) engage with a preassessment and broad overview of ecological succession, (2) explore authentic research data representing secondary center dot succession in beaver ponds, (3) explain data using detective activities, (4) elaborate with a mystery pond, and (5) evaluate their new understanding by comparing a pre- and postassessment. This lesson plan meets the objectives for AP Environmental Science Biology courses as well as the core concepts and competencies for undergraduate biology education from the Vision and Change report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2011.

DE biomechanics; Cartesian diver; cell size; cell mass; cell density;
   testate amoebas
AB Cell size is an important variable in the study of cellular growth, metabolism, and the cell cycle. The large size of Amoeba proteus and the ease with which it can be collected and cultured have made it a star in biology education-and it was a model for research on cell biology before the introduction of molecular genetic methods. Measuring the cytoplasmic density of a single amoeba without modern instrumentation seems like a difficult task, but this was done with supreme accuracy in the 1940s. The solution was based on the familiar Cartesian diver that is used to demonstrate Archimedes's principle. It required the fabrication of a tiny diver that would respond to the additional mass of a cell. Experiments using this method allowed investigators to study changes in size and density associated with feeding, starvation, and cell division. This research is an illustration of the ingenuity of cell biologists in the pre-molecular genetic era of their field, which is often overlooked by contemporary scientists. The consideration of the mass, density, and buoyancy of free-living amoebas encourages a new hypothesis about the evolution of testate amoebas.

TI Educators' Views on Dissection Alternatives at the Onset of the COVID-19
   Pandemic
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE alternatives; dissection; education
AB When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, many schools made the decision to cancel face-to-face classes and move instruction online. To better understand how the pandemic affected science educators' plans to conduct classroom animal dissection exercises, we conducted a nationwide survey of biology teachers (n = 2131) and asked about their experience as classes transitioned to online. Our survey revealed that 72% of biology educators had planned on having their students participate in classroom animal dissection exercises in the spring of 2020. Of those educators, 29% shifted to the use of dissection alternatives, such as web-based programs, as a result of remote learning. Our survey investigated which alternatives were most used, whether teachers were already familiar with the alternatives, how teachers identified those alternatives, and whether the educators planned to use dissection alternatives again for inperson or online learning. These survey results provide insight into biology educators' use of dissection alternatives during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as their post-pandemic plans and may increase awareness and usage of dissection alternatives within the educational community.

AB Ecological illiteracy exists, in part, because students may be technologically advanced but often lack intellectual curiosity about their natural environment. Botanical illiteracy, often referred to as "plant blindness," results from several interacting factors, including a lack of interest in plants and insufficient exposure to plant science before students reach college. We were interested in understanding how a hands-on activity planting native plant species translates across undergraduate majors in improving botanical literacy, as well as increasing awareness and concern about the loss of plant and pollinator biodiversity worldwide. We conducted a survey of both life-science majors and nonmajors to examine their attitudes toward native plants and pollinators. We also examined the change in attitudes of science majors following a hands-on native garden planting activity. We found that life-science majors generally had a stronger understanding and valuation of native plants and pollinators than nonmajors. We also found that life-science majors demonstrated an increase in their knowledge and valuation of native plants and pollinators after participation in the gardening activity. We suggest that this type of activity is important in alleviating plant blindness and in increasing ecological literacy, even among already knowledgeable science students.

ID DIFFUSION; OSMOSIS
AB The inability of students to properly understand the principles underlying osmosis and tonicity leads to misconceptions that further impair their ability to apply these concepts to physiological situations. We describe a simple and inexpensive visual exercise using beads and water to mimic solutions. Using these model solutions, students will understand the concepts of tonicity and osmolarity. The hands-on exercise is supplemented with a worksheet that reinforces the concepts they learned in doing the activity. This exercise has broad application with respect to both the level of students targeted and the courses in which it can be utilized, and it is flexible enough to personalize for each situation.

TI Reconsidering the Use of the Passive Voice in Scientific Writing
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE active voice; ESL science writers; American; European; world scientific
   journals
AB I briefly review the use of the passive and active voices in scientific writing and formulate an argument in favor of the active voice's use. I provide fictitious examples of each narrative type and make a side-by-side comparison. Each style has advantages and disadvantages. Papers written in the active voice are concise and clear, although they are also considered colloquial and unsophisticated. Those written in the passive voice, in turn, are centered on the actions - rather than on the individuals - and are perceived as more objective but can also be ambiguous and pompous. I conclude this essay by noting that the active voice - with its greater economy, simplicity, and precision - is now pervasive in scientific writing, and I urge educators to greatly reduce teaching and enforcing the use of the passive voice.

TI Modeling RNA Translation with Craft Supplies
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE model; pipe cleaners; protein synthesis; tRNA; translation
AB Students often struggle with the concept of protein synthesis, which incorporates two main processes: transcription and translation. This article describes an activity in which students use craft supplies to physically model the process of translation. The teacher creates the modeling kits, and then students use a worksheet to prepare the kit for a specific amino acid sequence. They practice the process of translation, including the start, tRNAs movement through the ribosome, the amino acid chain building, and the stop. This article describes how to create the model kits and implement the activity in the classroom. We have performed this hands-on activity in college classrooms as large as 170 students. Students appreciate the hands-on approach and find the activity extremely useful in understanding translation. While students model translation, the teaching team identifies and helps students overcome any misconceptions and gaps in their knowledge.

AB A partnership between a community college biology professor and a local high school teacher was established to engage high school students in authentic microbiology research. High school students isolated actinomycetes from soil samples and tested them for their ability to produce antimicrobial chemicals. They also designed and carried out their own experiments with these isolates. Laboratory reports, written assignments, and quizzes were used to assess the scientific learning of the subject covered by the research project. The students' attitudes about science and scientific research were assessed using a standardized survey and written reflection questions. In completing this project, the students applied their knowledge of the scientific method and experimental design to address authentic research questions. They also learned several hands-on laboratory skills, including serial dilution, aseptic technique, isolation of pure cultures, Gram staining, microscopy, and antimicrobial testing. Student feedback was overwhelmingly positive - many expressed an increased interest in pursuing a career in science, and most felt that the project helped them gain confidence in their ability to do science. This project illustrates the importance of establishing partnerships between secondary schools and academic institutions to successfully introduce research to younger students.

AB Student participation in authentic research, as citizen scientists, can improve classroom engagement, achievement of learning objectives, and perceptions of science. We present DNA barcoding of invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans) prey as an example student citizen-science project, though the protocols, objectives, and outcomes can be generalized to any piscivorous fish. The objective of this five-lab conservation genetics unit is to enhance student understanding of fundamental molecular and ecological concepts through applied use of DNA sequencing technologies. Student assessments were equivocal, indicating modest gains in conceptual understanding and maintenance of an overall high perception of science. More notably, student findings have contributed to an improved understanding of the impacts of invasive lionfish, including providing the first evidence that lionfish prey on economically important red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus).

AB The Bio-Rad pGLO bacterial transformation kit is commonly used to demonstrate this form of genetic exchange, which occurs in bacteria and eukaryotes and which differs fundamentally from transduction and conjugation. The basic experiment leads to the formation of green fluorescent colonies of Escherichia coli and can be extended to illustrate the specificity of the interaction between sugars and the AraC protein, the phenomenon of carbon catabolite repression, the substrate specificity of the beta-lactamase encoded by the plasmid, and the role of host restriction/modification systems in the transformation process. pGLO DNA also can be isolated using plasmid mini-prep kits, analyzed with restriction endonucleases, and used to study the conditions for transformation in more detail.

AB Biodiversity encompasses the variety within and between species in an environment. Native communities host a diverse array of species and interactions among members. Invasions by non-native species reduce biodiversity and a community's ability to support diverse assemblages, and are among the largest drivers of modern species extinctions. The Keep It Native Demonstration (KIND) Garden demonstrates the differences between invaded and intact plant communities. Utilizing this resource, we developed an inquiry-based activity for grades 5-7 that focused on observational data. Student groups recorded the number of animal and plant species in multiple habitat types. We then compiled data from the separate groups and averaged the number of species observed in each habitat type. The results were graphed to enable students to visualize the differences in species diversity among habitats. This exercise illustrated differences in species richness and diversity between invaded and native plant dominated areas, and allowed students to begin initial data interpretation. We provide methods for this activity, strategies for implementing the activity on other sites, and adaptations to accommodate different grade levels and the associated Next Generation Science Standards.

AB Students have little opportunity to observe or experiment with blood filtration in the nephron. Thus, we have developed a modeling activity on the blood filtration in the nephron for middle school students. The students present their mental models of the principles of blood filtration in small groups. They then participate in a hands-on activity to conduct the blood filtration process using a syringe filter, then revising their initial models based on the activity and data analysis. Through this modeling activity, the students can build their knowledge about the excretion principle.

TI Service Learning as Inquiry in an Undergraduate Science Course
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE service leaning; undergraduate science; inquiry
AB To engage students in applying scientific process skills to real-world issues, we implemented a service-learning project model in our undergraduate introductory biology course for science majors. This model illustrates how we integrate inquiry inside and outside of the classroom through four steps: service, learning, classroom, and community. Out-of-class activities engaged students in serving the community (Service step) while deepening their learning experience beyond what they would learn in a classroom (Learning step). To connect the service-learning project with scientific process skills, students were asked to identify problems that our community partners were trying to solve, identify proposed solutions, and design ways to evaluate those solutions (Classroom step). Additionally, students connected their service-learning topic with core concepts in Biology. After their service, students used metrics to analyze their impact. Students then synthesized the connection between their service, learning, and classroom projects by presenting their findings to the scientific and lay communities through a poster session (Community step). Here we provide details of the model, recommendations, and examples for others to execute an inquiry-based service-learning project.

AB In this inquiry-based lab, students are provided with a case study involving a young boy with a head injury exhibiting various symptoms, as well as simulated blood and urine samples to help diagnose the boy's disease. Throughout the course of the lab, students research, design, and conduct a series of tests culminating in a patient prognosis. All of the materials, which simulate the blood, urine, and testing compounds, are readily available at the grocery store or online. This real-world problem engages the students to think about negative feedback systems, patient symptoms, the hormones associated with blood glucose levels and urine production, as well as the detection techniques employed by physicians to diagnose patients. Diagnostic methods, testing procedures, and the disease itself make this lab extraordinarily relevant to the lives of students, as evidenced by our students' reactions to the lab.

TI Using <i>Drosophila</i> to Study How Genes Control Cell Migration
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Drosophila oogenesis; cell migration; gene expression
ID C/EBP
AB Cell migration is a basic developmental function that serves to build tissues, organs, and whole animals. Defects in cell migration are associated with birth defects and cancer, in particular the metastasis of tumors. Over the past forty years researchers have used the fruit fly to understand the genetic basis of development, including cell migration, but many of the tools and approaches used are beyond the skills and understanding of an undergraduate and advanced high school lab. We have developed a practical lab that allows students to use fly oogenesis to understand how genes regulate cell migration. Students learn to sort males from females, recognize fly genetic markers to identify wild type and mutant animals, hand-dissect ovaries, perform histochemical staining to reveal gene expression in this tissue, and visualize normal and aberrant cell migration using light microscopy to distinguish the effect of a key mutation in a gene required for cell migration. From this approach, students learn how mutations can aid in understanding gene function and how modern genetic tools and microscopy are used to study gene expression and development. Because these genes have human homologs, students learn how model organisms can be used to understand the molecular basis of disease and disorders, such as cancer.

ID BIOLOGY TEACHERS; SCIENCE; CREATIONISM
AB Evolutionary theory is critical for a comprehensive understanding of biology, yet students often fail to grasp its underlying principles. This results partially from ineffective teaching; however, the use of interactive activities could alleviate this problem. In this guided investigation of evolutionary mechanisms, students use LEGO bricks to simulate how mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural selection can affect the evolution of a population. This exercise was undertaken and assessed with college introductory biology students, but is also appropriate for advanced high school students.

   large-lecture; scenario-based learning; undergraduate education
AB Learning theorists have provided ample evidence supporting the use of active, student-centered, social learning environments. However, little action has been taken within U.S. university curricula to transform lecture courses so that they include such teaching methods. By adding cooperative and collaborative activities into large-lecture, introductory biology courses, I was able to measure the impacts of such active-learning strategies on student attendance and performance. I gathered data from two investigations involving 378 undergraduates from paired sections of biology, one section using active-learning activities and one not. In the first investigation, I used a mixed-methods approach to measure the effects of a cooperative pre-exam group discussion on student performance, confidence, and anxiety. In the second investigation, I used a quantitative approach to measure the effects on course attendance and performance of using scenario-based collaborative activities regularly throughout a semester. Students who engaged in cooperative pre-exam discussion did not show significant individual learning gains but did show an increase in confidence and a decrease in anxiety. Students who engaged in scenario-based collaborative activities showed significantly higher learning gains and course attendance. The identified gains are promising for course reform.

This assignment encourages students to explore animal behavior through online videos while developing research and critical-thinking skills. The approach allows students to get a field-like experience from a lecture-based class and enhances knowledge about behavior of animals beyond the students' geographic area. In addition, this assignment is consistent with the AAAS's vision of change in undergraduate biology teaching. This assignment is appropriate for both college and high school biology classes that cover animal behavior, ecology, or conservation.

Results revealed changes along various measured attitude variables. Most notably, participants saw significant positive shifts in their perceptions of biology as a scientific field that contrasted with their relatively stable perceptions of biologists as scientists. Implications are discussed in the context of the impacts of nonmajors biology courses on future K-12 science instructors and potential influxes of students into the science pipeline.

AB Astrobiology seeks to understand life in the universe through various disciplines and approaches. Astrobiology not only provides crosscutting content, but its study supports the three dimensions of learning promoted by the Next Generation Science Standards. While astrobiology research has been progressive and has accomplished great feats for science and society, astrobiology education in schools and colleges has lagged behind astrobiology research. Astrobiology can be used in the classroom as an engaging context for the Socratic method or in long-or short-term projects to encourage higher-order thinking.

AB Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) and evolution are examples of issues that are perceived differently by scientists and the general public. Within the scientific community, there are clear consensuses that human activities are increasing global temperatures (ACC) and that evolutionary mechanisms have led to the bio-diversity of life on Earth (evolution). However, there is much debate in the public discourse about the scientific evidence supporting these topics. The purpose of our study was to explore the relationship between a student's need for cognition (NFC) - preference to engage in and enjoy thinking -and the student's acceptance of ACC and evolution. The results revealed that students with a higher NFC were more accepting of both ACC and evolution. Future investigations should include evaluating the efficacy of different instructional techniques on NFC and acceptance of polarizing topics such as evolution and ACC.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a serious global health problem, resulting in >1.4 million deaths each year. Of increasing concern is the evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacterium that causes TB. Using this real-world scenario, we created a 90-minute activity for high school or undergraduate students to use online bioinformatics tools to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between a wild-type and a variant Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene that could confer resistance to a commonly used TB antibiotic, rifampin. Students write a scientific explanation, providing evidence and reasoning, to support their claim of antibiotic resistance or susceptibility. The entire lesson can be found online at http://www.stronglab.org/taylor.

TI A Mixed Exam Format Closes the Gap for Students with a Conflict between
   Their Religious Belief & the Theory of Evolution
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Evolution; religious conflict; learning assessment; introductory biology
ID ACCEPTANCE; CREATION
AB We assessed the performance of students with a self-reported conflict between their religious belief and the theory of evolution in two sections of a large introductory biology course (N = 373 students). Student performance was measured through pretest and posttest evolution essays and multiple-choice (MC) questions (evolution-related and non-evolution-related questions) on the final exam and posttest. The two class sections differed only in exam format: MC with or without constructed-response (CR) questions. Although students with a reported conflict scored significantly lower on the final exam in the MC-only section, they scored equally well in the MC+CR section, and all students in the MC+CR section performed significantly better overall. As a result, (1) a religious conflict with evolution can be negatively associated with student achievement in introductory biology, but (2) assessment with constructed response was associated with a closed performance gap between students with and without a conflict. We suggest that differences in exam format and focus on student acceptance of evolution (either evidence-based or opinion), rather than reported conflict, may contribute to the inconsistencies in student learning of evolution across research studies, and that CR questions may help students overcome other obstacles to learning evolution.

TI Using a Cyclical Diagram to Visualize the Events of the Ovulatory
   Menstrual Cycle
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Ovulation; menstrual cycle; holistic diagram
ID STUDENTS; CONTRACEPTION; COGNITION; THERAPY; TEXT
AB Over the past 10 years, college textbooks in human anatomy and physiology have typically presented the events of the ovulatory menstrual cycle in a linear format, with time in days shown on the x-axis, and hormone levels, follicular development, and uterine lining on the y-axis. In addition, the various events are often shown over a 28-day cycle, when they can take place over 21-35 days and may not be regular at all. Here, we propose a circular diagram that is independent of a set cycle time and readily shows the cyclic nature of the events. This diagram can be presented sequentially in organized layers, and additional complexity can be added. In addition, we present questions here that can promote self-learning before and critical thinking after the discussion of the cycle to enhance understanding of the physiological events.

AB This study explores upper-elementary and early-middle-school students' ideas about cells and inheritance and describes patterns of understanding for these topics. Data came from students' responses to embedded assessments included in a technology-enhanced curriculum designed to help students learn about cells and heredity. Our findings suggest that the instruction aided students in progressing to more sophisticated levels of understanding, especially by reviewing non-normative ideas and integrating new content into their previous understandings. Students, however, tended to struggle in distinguishing genes, chromosomes, and DNA and had some difficulties connecting the cell division process with the inheritance of genetic material.

AB Understanding human environmental health is difficult for high school students, as is the process of scientific investigation. This module provides a framework to address both concerns through an inquiry-based approach using a hypothesis-driven set of experiments that draws upon a real-life concern, environmental exposures to lead (Pb2+). Students learn how scientists use model organisms to understand basic biological concepts, and how these models relate to human and environmental health. Students observe how Pb2+ alters fish behaviors. Because many levels of biological organization are involved, this module has application for multiple units within general and advanced biology classes. Beginning with what is known about Pb2+ toxicity, students develop testable hypotheses about how it may affect behavior, apply this knowledge to human populations, and identify the "next experiment."

DT Article
DE GPS; geocaching; technology; trees; botany; plants
AB Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can be used to connect students to the natural world and improve their skills in observation, identification, and classification. Using GPS devices in the classroom increases student interest in science, encourages team-building skills, and improves biology content knowledge. Additionally, it helps educators meet the ISTE's Educational Technology Standards and the National Science Education Standards while increasing the environmental literacy of their students. This paper provides suggestions for utilizing GPS technology in student-led explorations of the local flora, as well as other innovative ideas for using these devices in science instruction.

TI Vaccination: A Public Health Intervention That Changed History & Is
   Changing with History

DT Article

ID HERD-IMMUNITY; MEASLES OUTBREAK; MMR VACCINE; AUTISM; PERTUSSIS; GENOME;
   IDENTIFICATION; POLIOMYELITIS; IMMUNIZATION; ASSOCIATION
AB One of the most successful prophylactic interventions in the history of public health, vaccination helped control some of the deadliest and most debilitating infectious diseases. As a result of vaccination programs, smallpox was eradicated worldwide, poliomyelitis was nearly eradicated and emerges as the next eradication target, and national programs helped reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in many countries. Other, more recent vaccines have already achieved a visible impact, as revealed by the ability of the hepatitis B vaccine to decrease the number of new hepatitis infections and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. While vaccination, like any other medical intervention, may have adverse effects, significant controversies gravitated, in recent years, around its supposed link to autism. One of the articles that provided substantial support for this link was recently retracted amid evidence of ample scientific and ethical misconduct. As studies from several countries found that the incidence of autism was increasing even after the removal of thimerosal from vaccines, it appears that, in all likelihood, this trend was not caused by the mercury-containing preservative, and potential causes have to be pursued somewhere else. Although many early vaccines were prepared empirically from live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, recent years have witnessed a shift toward a more rational strategy, in which concepts from disciplines including molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics are increasingly incorporated into vaccine design, transforming vaccinology into a dynamic and vibrant interdisciplinary field.

   standards; No Child Left Behind Act of 2001; standardized educational

AB Mandated biology curriculum standards and standardized tests may vary widely from one state to another, making academic-performance comparisons among the states problematic. This report outlines the effects of the "No Child Left Behind" law and uses California as a test case against which teachers in other states may make comparisons of their own biology curriculum standards and tests. Several sources are cited that offer sample multiple-choice questions that have appeared on previous California standardized tests for sciences/life sciences/biology. These examples, and critique thereof, may help teachers better prepare their own tests to improve student performance in meeting the state's curriculum standards in individual science classes and in mandated statewide tests.

AB Erasmus Darwin was a founding member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, the members of which were referred to as "Lunaticks." He is here described as a polymath, an 18th-century "natural philosopher" who was a physician, scientist (with interests in botany, zoology, meteorology, chemistry, among others), inventor, and poet who also advanced quite profound evolutionary ideas two generations prior to those of his grandson, Charles Robert Darwin.

DT Article
DE Flower; floral; structure; formula; formulae; virtual; dissection
AB The study of flower structure is essential in plant identification and in understanding sexual reproduction in plants, pollination syndromes, plant breeding, and fruit structure. Thus, study of flower structure and construction of floral formulae are standard parts of first-year university botany and biology courses. These activities involve developing a complex set of skills, and it is useful for students to review this material after practical sessions. The Virtual Floral Formula Web site provides students with a unique resource for practicing their floral structure interpretation skills. The site provides detailed dissection photographs of the flowers of 12 species, and floral formulae are progressively assembled via drop-down menus. When students are satisfied with their answers, they submit them, and any discrepancies from the "official" formula are highlighted. Students appreciate the interactivity of the application, the feedback they receive on any inaccuracies in their formulae, and the ability to make progressive improvements in their skills.

AB I describe three activities that allow students to explore the ideas of evolution, natural selection, extinction, mass extinction, and rates of evolutionary change by engaging a simple model using paper, pens, chalk, and a chalkboard. As a culminating activity that supports expository writing in the sciences, the students write an essay on mass extinction. All activities are geared for high school biology and perhaps introductory college biology classes. With little modification, activities 1 and 2 can be used successfully in middle school and perhaps in the higher elementary grade levels.

ID MELANOGASTER; EVOLUTION; RESISTANCE; LOCI
AB We propose an experimental model suitable for demonstrating allele frequency change in Drosophila melanogaster populations caused by selection against an easily scorable conditional lethal, namely recessive flightless alleles such as apterous and vestigial. Homozygotes for these alleles are excluded from reproduction because the food source used to establish each generation is accessible only by flight. The observed dynamics of flightless-allele frequencies generally follows the theoretically predicted pattern, with slight deviation toward less intense selection. We also suggest observing selection against flight-independent visible marker alleles in the same population as a meaningful comparison. The proposed experiments can easily be scheduled within one semester, and the expected data provide ample opportunities for discussion of quantitative evolutionary patterns.

TI A Class Project for Investigating Possible Future Local Effects of
   Global Climate Change through Student Analysis of Fossil Faunas
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE climate change; paleontology; fossils; Pleistocene
AB A common question posed to environmental scientists by nonscientists, particularly policymakers, is the following: In a world that is globally warmer, what will the new climate be like in specific geographical regions? This question has been and continues to be addressed by computer modeling, a technique that is out of reach for vast majority of students. However, an alternate approach to investigating this issue exists that is more practical for students. Past climates can be inferred for specific regions from fossils, utilizing climate tolerances of related modern organisms. When these inferred past climates correspond to periods of the Earth's history where levels of carbon dioxide were as high or higher than today, these data can be used to extrapolate possible future local climates in a globally warmer world. The last Pleistocene interglacial period (known as the Eemian), which occurred approximately 120,000 years ago, is an ideal time period for studies of this kind for the following reasons. First, carbon dioxide levels were elevated at this time to levels approximating modern global conditions, and the world was warmer as evidenced by a much higher sea level than exists today. Secondly, most Eemian-age animals (especially mollusks) still exist, have known climate tolerances, and are relatively common as fossils. Students examining fossil mollusk faunas have applied this methodology to infer the Eemian climates of South Florida and coastal Virginia and found unexpectedly that for both regions the Eemian climate did not greatly differ from the modern one. The methodology described here can be used to address other important questions and puts such authentic and potentially valuable scientific research within practical reach of student scientists.

ID PREFERENCES
AB First pioneered in 2010, Fish Cam provides the opportunity for students to engage in novel behavioral research without the need for extensive materials or for leaving the classroom. Fish Cam utilizes a robust behavioral paradigm, shoaling behavior in fish, and enables students to collect information from simple, easy-to-understand observations, allowing for student-led experimental design, data collection, analysis, and discussions on the scientific process. In these ways Fish Cam removes the cost and time-intensive aspects of doing this sort of work in the classroom. Shoaling behavior, which is well represented in the scientific literature, refers to social aggregations of fish. Almost all species of fish form shoals, and this process is easy to study under laboratory conditions. An evolutionary adaptation, shoaling provides individuals better access to resources and decreases the risk of predation. In its initial launch, Fish Cam was highly successful as a learning tool but suffered from difficulties associated with delivering the information online in 2010. Now, with the rapid development of online communication tools associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have the second iteration of Fish Cam. The flexibility of new delivery platforms enables partner organizations to view experiments and adapt the experience to their specific educational goals.

TI Sexual Selection as a Tool to Improve Student Reasoning of Evolution
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE evolution; sexual selection; biology education research;
   student-reasoning
ID MISCONCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; CHOICE
AB There is an emphasis on survival-based selection in biology education that can allow students to neglect other important evolutionary components, such as sexual selection, reproduction, and inheritance. Student understanding of the role of reproduction in evolution is as important as student understanding of the role of survival. Limiting instruction to survival-based scenarios (e.g., effect of food on Galapagos finch beak shape) may not provide students with enough context to guide them to complete evolutionary reasoning. Different selection forces can work in concert or oppose one another, and sexual selection can lead to the selection of trait variants that are maladaptive for survival. In semistructured interviews with undergraduate biology students (n = 12), we explored how leading students through a sequence of examples affected student reasoning of evolution. When presented with an example where sexual selection and survivability favored the same variant of a trait, students emphasized survival in their reasoning. When presented with a scenario where sexual selection selected for trait variants that were maladaptive for survival, more students described how two different selection forces contributed to evolutionary outcomes and described reproductive potential as a part of fitness. Moreover, these students considered how the maladaptive traits were inherited in the population. Scenarios where sexual selection and survival-based selection were opposed improved student ability to reason about how factors other than survival impact evolutionary change. When instructors introduce students to scenarios where survival-based selection and sexual selection are opposed, they allow students to change their reasoning toward inclusion of reproduction in their evolutionary reasoning.

AB As researchers, teachers, and practitioners we often encounter young professionals and lay adults who do not understand basics of mammalian body temperature regulation. Often their single solid piece of knowledge is that some vertebrates (mammals and birds) are warm-blooded and some (fish, amphibians, and reptile) are cold-blooded, which is incorrect. There are many thermal capabilities and regulatory strategies. We provide basics of body temperature regulation, including definitions, its evolution, examples of body temperature variability, unique examples of hibernation and torpor, and we explain how a better understanding benefits individuals in personal and professional lives. We suggest a simple replacement of the warm-blooded paradigm that can be used to inform even young students. As a starting point, students young and old are familiar with species of mammals (e.g., platypus and opossums) that do not maintain as constant or as warm of a body temperature as humans and dogs. Students also know that humans do not maintain a constant body temperature over time (they have a "temperature" when sick) or all part of their body (they have cold hands and feet outside in winter).

ID DIFFUSION
AB A simple homemade greenhouse was constructed as a part of the high school project during the learning-from-home period. The greenhouse was used to show CO2 absorption by Sansevieria trifasciata during the night, obeying Fick's law of diffusion, while the CO2 emission by the medium used to grow the plant does not. Although other plants can be used for this purpose, the use of Sansevieria is interesting and offers certain advantages because it absorbs CO2 during the night. The project could also provide a simple tool for high school students to investigate the absorption and emission of CO2 from home or in laboratory. Extension of this project to investigate the effect of plant respiration on the environmental parameters, such as decreasing temperature and increasing humidity, is also possible.

ID QUANTITATION
AB High protein shakes have become increasingly popular as nutritional supplements for adolescents, adults, and senior citizens. They are heavily advertised on television and in print media and are available in grocery and health food stores, at pharmacies, and from online distributors. In this project, students use colorimetric assays to determine the protein concentration of a particular product they bring to class and compare the results to the nutritional label. Students then use denaturing and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to characterize the protein composition of their protein shakes. These experiments promote critical thinking about common scientific procedures and should be of interest to both secondary school and college students.

AB Increasingly, students training in the biological sciences depend on a proper grounding in biological statistics, data science and experimental design. As biological datasets increase in size and complexity, transparent data management and analytical methods are essential skills for undergraduate biologists. We propose that using the software R and RStudio are effective tools to train first- and second-year undergraduate students in data visualization and foundational statistical analyses. Here, we present the redesigned laboratory curriculum for our Experimental Design and Statistics course, a required course for all first- or second-year biology majors at Lawrence University, a small liberal arts institution in northeast Wisconsin. We include an example 10-week syllabus and eight laboratory exercises (as supplementary materials) for undergraduate institutions that aim to introduce and guide students through acquiring a basic understanding of biostatistical analyses and skills using R and RStudio. We also provide a flexible framework and examples that are easily modifiable and cover the essential biostatistics and data science skills needed for biology undergraduates. Finally, we discuss the potential pitfalls and obstacles as well as the intrinsic benefits and expected outcomes of our laboratories.

TI Virtual Reality: Flight of Fancy or Feasible? Ways to Use Virtual
   Reality Technologies to Enhance Students' Science Learning
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Curriculum; instruction; virtual presence; virtual reality
AB Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technology that provides K-12 students with unique experiences for robust science learning by transporting them to a virtual world where they may engage directly with scientific phenomena. This is because VR creates lifelike three-dimensional spaces where students can manipulate objects; heat; see, and sometimes feel the environment; and explore places that mimic attributes of the real world. VR holds great utility in science education by engaging students in science topics that may be otherwise inaccessible to them in the real world. This inaccessibility may stem from the content (being too small, large, or abstract), safety issues (too hazardous or dangerous), not having access to the materials in their context, possessing physical or cognitive disabilities where they need to do the activity repeatedly or differently, or having cultural, religious, or ethical concerns related to conducting specific science experiments. This commentary discusses how three key types of VR hardware (VR viewers, desktop VR systems, and head-mounted displays) can be incorporated into science standards, curriculum, and instruction by delineating the pros and cons of each. The commentary concludes with specific, stepwise guidance in ideating, designing, and implementing VR-based experiences for K-12 students in the science classroom.

DE Homework; instructional practices; formative assessment; motivation;

AB Homework is an integral component of most science courses but can have an impact on student learning only when students actually complete the assignment. Low completion rate of homework, then, is an impediment to student success in science courses, and a source of frustration for instructor and students alike. Here, we outline a set of design principles supported by research in how students learn, intended to streamline outside-of-class assignments to address course goals, improve student buy-in and motivation, and provide instructors better formative assessment data. We also share examples of outside-of-class assignments aligned to these principles to aid instructors in shortening and focusing the homework they choose to assign in their courses.

TI Teaching Membrane Transport Concepts Using Flipped Teaching &

DT Article
DE flipped teaching; dramatizations; membrane transport; active learning
ID STUDENTS
AB Cell membrane transport is an important topic discussed in the biology classroom from the middle school to the graduate level. Membrane transport is complex, and students are often confused between different types of transport mechanisms. Dramatization is an active-learning strategy to engage students in learning. The flipped teaching method is designed to introduce lecture content prior to class meeting, thus creating time during class to adapt active-learning strategies such as dramatization. In this work, students were given a pretest prior to the dramatization activity. As each type of membrane transport was discussed, which included simple diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, and active transport, students were assigned specific roles to demonstrate the movement. The dramatization activity triggered many questions related to the topic, and these questions were addressed immediately. A posttest was conducted at the end of the dramatization activity. Our results demonstrated increases in the students' understanding, engagement, and confidence level. The combination of flipped teaching and dramatization thus serves as a studentcentered active-learning strategy for teaching difficult biological concepts.

AB Crosscutting concepts (CCCs) are superordinate in the scientific concept system, common across disciplines, and very abstract. These characteristics, with the addition of incoherence in their curricular presentation, can challenge instructors. We designed a modular course based on coherence and conceptual understanding. The course structure was arranged in accordance with intra- and inter-unit coherence of CCCs, and each lesson was prepared according to "concept-based instruction" and the "5E instructional model." The results of the pretest and posttest and the semi-structured interviews consistently showed that the participating high school students significantly improved their understanding of CCCs, thus supporting the effectiveness of the modular course.

AB Authentic, "messy data" contain variability that comes from many sources, such as natural variation in nature, chance occurrences during research, and human error. It is this messiness that both deters potential users of authentic data and gives data the power to create unique learning opportunities that reveal the nature of science itself. While the value of bringing contemporary research and messy data into the classroom is recognized, implementation can seem overwhelming. We discuss the importance of frequent interactions with messy data throughout K-16 science education as a mechanism for students to engage in the practices of science, such as visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting data. Next, we describe strategies to help facilitate the use of messy data in the classroom while building complexity over time. Finally, we outline one potential sequence of activities, with specific examples, to highlight how various activity types can be used to scaffold students' interactions with messy data.

TI Evaluating the Use of Avida-ED Digital Organisms to Teach Evolution &

AB The concepts of evolution and natural selection remain as some of the most challenging topics to teach. The difficulty in teaching these topics arises from the fact that evolution is difficult to observe, and computer simulations do not always result in a clear understanding of evolutionary principles. Recently, the Avida-ED software has been developed to simulate evolution in a laboratory setting. Unlike other simulations, Avida-ED allows students to manipulate the environment, change the genetics of the virtual organisms, and track offspring in real time. We have demonstrated, by using pretest and posttest questionnaires, that students gained a deeper understanding of evolutionary concepts by using this software. In particular, students showed the greatest increase in their ability to explain evolutionary concepts in answers to open-ended questions. Our results show that Avida-ED could be a useful tool in helping students understand and combat preconceived notions about evolution.

AB Molecular biology topics tend to be abstract and hard to visualize, and consequently pupils form many misconceptions about genetics and molecular biology. We describe how to make a hands-on educational set that provides visual and tactile modeling of DNA replication, transcription, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and random mutations so that students can examine these processes in detail. The set is inexpensive and easy to make, has been used successfully, and allows for modification to fit individual teachers' needs.

AB Learning about heredity is important across the K-12 continuum. However, these ideas may be challenging for students. We examined third-grade students' ideas about heredity in the context of a new, six-week, model-based science unit that uses corn as a model organism to support students' ideas about heredity. We analyzed data collected during implementation of the unit, including student artifacts and interviews. We compared these data to those from a pilot version of the curriculum - implemented in the prior year - that was focused on the same disciplinary concepts but was not designed around scientific modeling. Our findings illustrate levels of understanding in students' ideas about three target concepts underlying heredity: life cycles, trait inheritance, and trait variation. We also found that students experiencing the model-based version of the unit exhibited higher levels of understanding for two of the three target concepts than those experiencing the non-model-based curriculum. Analysis of student interviews also showed that students experiencing the model-based curriculum were better able to use key elements of life cycle, such as pollination and reproduction to support their explanations about inheritance. We discuss implications of this work for design and enactment of model-based curricula in elementary grades that can support students' learning about heredity.

AB Science departments in higher education have been adjusting their curricula to include more inquiry-based instruction, and research on inquiry-based teaching at the collegiate level has been increasing. However, more data are needed regarding the effectiveness of inquiry-based pedagogy in improving students' conceptual understanding and attitudes toward science. The investigation described here was focused on nontraditional students taking non-science-major science courses. The goal was to compare students' attitudes toward science before and after taking an inquiry-based or a traditional science course. The hypothesis that the inquiry-based course would significantly generate a more positive attitude toward science was supported. Nontraditional students' perceptions of an effective science curriculum were also explored. Students' perceptions were very positive regarding inquiry-based learning; however, those who had not been previously taught through inquiry-based methods had reserved perceptions of this teaching approach. Regardless of the course they were enrolled in, students agreed overall that an effective science curriculum includes three common themes: connection, interaction, and application.

AB Much evidence supports the role of writing-to-learn (WTL) assignments in improving student learning and argumentation skills. However, designing effective assignments can be challenging for instructors. We describe a process for modifying WTL assignments that were originally developed for small undergraduate biology classes (24 students) for use in large introductory cell biology courses (>80 students). Students explore a socioscientific issue (cancer treatment) intended to engage them. Students learn content through reading journal articles and textbook chapters, attending class, and participating in discussions. All along, students participate in iterative writing assignments and engage in peer evaluation and self-evaluation. Finally, students write persuasive arguments about how best to treat cancer. We describe how instructors can develop their own WTL assignments in their large biology courses.

AB The Hardy-Weinberg principle and associated calculations are often challenging for students to learn for three reasons. First, several assumptions need to be understood to correctly apply the principle. Second a series of calculations are required for proper application. Third, the principle, assumptions, and calculations are often taught separately from students observing population changes over time. We describe a classroom activity in which students investigate how the allele frequencies of soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) populations change over time as a result of environmental disturbances by simulating the effects on population data These classroom population changes are then compared to authentic research data collected on populations of M. arenaria. This activity was implemented at three institutions in introductory- and senior-level biology courses. Students reported that the activity helped them better understand and apply both the principle and its calculations.

ID MYRIAPODA; ORDERS
AB Commensalism is the association of two organisms, one of which derives benefit while the other is unaffected. These relationships are common in nature and in unexpected environments. A good example of commensalism is the survival of nematodes in the intestine of millipedes. The diversity of life capable of living in such an environment is remarkable, sometimes with as many as eight species of nematodes living in the same region of the intestine. The primary goal of this work is to inspire students to gain the requisite skills to discover new life in host organisms that are readily available, accessible, and, in most cases, inexpensive or free. We have created a laboratory protocol to study the diversity of nematode life living inside the millipede intestine. This exercise is designed to teach students to test hypotheses, use taxonomic keys, dissect a millipede, recover nematodes, record data, and formulate a written conclusion. There is a high likelihood that students will discover new species of nematodes during this exercise. The suggested experimental design will catalyze students to investigate the potential of discovering new life in a backyard organism, and simultaneously ignite curiosity and promote a hands-on approach to the application of the scientific method.

TI An Emerging Amphibian Infection as a Model for Teaching Phylogenetic
   Reconstruction
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Emerging infection; amphibian; Ranavirus; phylogenetic reconstruction;
   evolutionary relationships
AB Phylogenetic analysis and interpretation can be challenging for many students, but emerging infections can provide a rich tapestry for addressing these topics while maintaining student interest. Ranaviruses are a group of emerging infections in amphibians that have been associated with morbidity and mortality events around the globe. They have also been implicated in population declines and local extirpations of some amphibian species. Many ranaviruses have been subject to intense study by scientists as they seek to understand the impacts of these viruses on a variety of ectothermic animals. A large amount of sequence data is available on GenBank and is easily accessible for students to use to study phylogenetic relationships between different viral species, strains, and isolates. This article examines the general process of obtaining sequence data, sequence alignments, and tree building by using databases, servers, and computer programs that are freely available to all high school and undergraduate students and their instructors. Providing students with a guided framework for exploring their own questions with respect to the evolutionary relationships of ranaviruses can produce some very unique and thought-provoking results.

DE Nature of science; NGSS; culture; society; authentic exploration;
   climate; data; interdisciplinary; bioethics; culturally relevant science
AB Image analysis of African rock art creates a unique opportunity to engage in authentic explorations of science and culture using rock art images as data. African rock art and its context provide insights into the intersection of science, scientific research, research ethics, intellectual property, law, government, economy, indigenous people, and crime. This article specifically considers the rock art and other cultural contributions of the San people of Southern Africa, which offer a rich interdisciplinary exploration of biology-including the climate and weather of biomes, plant biology, human physiology, and more. An understanding of the nature of science, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is implicated.

TI A Technique for Expediting Comprehensive Written Feedback on Assignments
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Feedback; assessment; workload
AB Providing detailed feedback in large classes is challenging. We describe how we develop an archive of comments while marking - noting good points, what needs improvement, and how to correct shortcomings. Comments are recorded in a single document with codes. Relevant codes are marked on students' work where issues arise. Each student's annotated assignment is returned with a copy of the comments for the class. Thus, they receive specific feedback on their own work, plus all comments given to the class. Instructors save on marking time because comments are written once on the master list, and only codes and a personalized summary statement are written on the assignment. Markers may collaborate in preparing comments to assist in moderation; some generic comments (e.g., presentation and grammar) are portable across different assignments and years; and comments from past years may form a rubric for sharing with students before they start an assignment.

ID SCIENCE
AB Models are simplified representations of more complex systems that help scientists structure the knowledge they acquire. As such, they are ubiquitous and invaluable in scientific research and communication. Because science education strives to make classroom activities more closely reflect science in practice, models have become integral teaching and learning tools woven throughout the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Although model-based learning and curriculum are not novel in educational theory, only recently has modeling taken center stage in K-12 national standards for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes. We present a variety of examples to outline the importance of various types of models and the practice of modeling in biological research, as well as the emphasis of NGSS on their use in both classroom learning and assessment. We then suggest best practices for creating and modifying models in the context of student-driven inquiry and demonstrate that even subtle incorporation of modeling into existing science curricula can help achieve student learning outcomes, particularly for English-language learners. In closing, we express the value of models and modeling in life beyond the classroom and research laboratory, and highlight the critical importance of "model literacy" for the next generation of scientists, engineers, and problem-solvers.

TI "Touching Triton": Building Student Understanding of Complex Disease
   Risk
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Complex disease; genetics; genomics; pedigree; serious game; high school
   biology; interactive game; computer simulation; disease risk
AB Life science classrooms often emphasize the exception to the rule when it comes to teaching genetics, focusing heavily on rare single-gene and Mendelian traits. By contrast, the vast majority of human traits and diseases are caused by more complicated interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Research indicates that students have a deterministic view of genetics, generalize Mendelian inheritance patterns to all traits, and have unrealistic expectations of genetic technologies. The challenge lies in how to help students analyze complex disease risk with a lack of curriculum materials. Providing open access to both content resources and an engaging storyline can be achieved using a "serious game" model. "Touching Triton" was developed as a serious game in which students are asked to analyze data from a medical record, family history, and genomic report in order to develop an overall lifetime risk estimate of six common, complex diseases. Evaluation of student performance shows significant learning gains in key content areas along with a high level of engagement.

TI Reading to Understand Anatomy: A Literature Circle Approach
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Literature Circles; selected readings; developing roles; structuring
   assignments
AB As a science teacher, I regularly use outside reading assignments (e. g., news articles) to help develop my students' understanding of topics addressed in my anatomy class. However, I have found that in simply reading texts, students often fail to (1) understand the context of the science discussed, (2) make the connections between ideas represented in the reading and those presented in class, and (3) appreciate the science that is being discussed. To better support my students' reading, I needed to structure their reading to direct them toward key ideas and prompt them to process the information deeply, to make connections between their readings and the concepts learned in class, and to understand the science content in context. To address these needs, and to help increase my students' science comprehension and encourage their thinking while reading, I turned to a language arts strategy called Literature Circles. Here, I describe my use of this successful strategy and provide resources to support other teachers who want to employ outside readings and/or Literature Circles in their own teaching.

AB Providing both introductory information and biosecurity protocols in laboratory, farm, and field settings is central to student learning and safety. However, even when clear protocols are provided, students do not fully understand the consequences of their actions. We present a crime scene that requires evidence investigation to improve basic skills and inquiry to identify biosecurity breaches. The crime-scene format engages students and encourages critical thinking about the negative effects of actions when working in various environments. This approach not only improves student skills through forensic microscopy but advances student retention of biosecurity requirements.

AB Biology courses have thousands of words to learn in order to intelligently discuss the subject and take tests over the material. Biological fluency is an important goal for students, and practical methods based on constructivist pedagogies can be employed to promote it. We present a method in which pairs of students write dialogues from instructor-assigned word lists that the student pairs then present before the class. This method helps students understand the contextual meaning of the biological terms, achieving true fluency rather than just memorizing definitions.

DE Non-majors biology; college biology; scientific literacy
ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY
AB The Hot Seat is a discussion-based activity that requires students enrolled in a biology course for non-majors to pose a question to the class that is related to the current lecture topic and facilitate a brief class discussion. This paper describes the Hot Seat, how it is assessed, and how it has influenced students' attitudes toward the course and biology in general. The Hot Seat has been successful in increasing students' understanding of biology, their appreciation of its relevance to their lives, and in-class participation.

AB The progression of the taxonomic organization of life from Linnaeus's original two kingdoms to the traditional five-kingdom system to today's widely accepted three-domain system is explored in a group-learning activity. Working with a set of organisms, students organize them into each system. Discussion after each step focuses on viewing classification schemes as hypotheses about the relatedness of organisms and how hypotheses are altered with accumulation of new data. Finally, the connection between phylogenetic trees and the hierarchal system of biological classification is emphasized by using tree-thinking to analyze the universal phylogenetic tree as the basis of the three-domain system.

AB Paramecia have many benefits in a biology classroom. They provide educational opportunities for students to learn about protists. Viewing paramecia allows students to observe organelles such as contractile vacuoles, food vacuoles, oral grooves, trichocysts, and macronuclei. The organism can be cultured easily and inexpensively using a plastic food container, wheat seeds, brewer's yeast, a standard aquarium, and a tank heater. An individual culture can typically last 2 to 3 weeks, and sometimes up to a month. Using this simple culturing method, a constant, on-demand supply of paramecia can be available in any biology classroom. This, coupled with the ability to concentrate paramecia, opens the door to a wide variety of laboratory applications.

To help illustrate these concepts, we developed a simulation model of microevolutionary processes. The model features all the components of Hardy-Weinberg theory, with population size, selection, gene flow, nonrandom mating, and mutation all being demonstrated in the simulations. By using this freely available computer model, students can develop and test hypotheses with replicated virtual experiments. Because the model is an agent-based simulation, there is biologically realistic variability in the results. Students using the model see results both numerically and graphically, and these are reinforced by an animation of the virtual fish in the simulated

ID OPTIMAL FORAGING THEORY
AB Optimal diet selection, a component of optimal foraging theory, suggests that animals should select a diet that either maximizes energy or nutrient consumption per unit time or minimizes the foraging time needed to attain required energy or nutrients. In this exercise, students simulate the behavior of foragers that either show no foraging preference or demonstrate a foraging preference based on profitability ratios ( average energy content of food item, E/average handling time, h). Foragers that optimize their diets consistently acquire more total energy in a timed foraging period. The demonstration is scalable to a full laboratory exercise with statistical analysis and graphing activities.

AB On December 18, 2021, "hemorrhagic fever" appeared in the news, and it was thought to be related to eating strawberries. In this practice, based on the epidemic, we instructed students to conduct self-investigation on hemorrhagic fever and Hantavirus, and guided students to perform an objective analysis of "hemorrhagic fever." This increases students' motivation for active learning and interest in the course, and also improves students' ability to obtain information and scientifically analyze the occurrence of epidemics.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE ruminant livestock; microbial ecology; applied microbiology; systems
   biology
AB Ruminant animals serve as an excellent platform for post-secondary biological science instructors to teach microbial ecology and systems biology. Instructors can extrapolate the dynamic interactions that microorganisms play in modifying the diet of a ruminant animal. This symbiosis can be used to teach how ruminants can thrive on low-quality feed yet produce high-quality substances such as meat and milk. Instructors can require students to create graphical models that represent these dynamics, through the lens of systems biology. Altogether, instructors should consider teaching microbiology in their introductory biological science courses through the lens of ruminant production; especially, since we live in a time when vast population interest revolves around the origins of our food.

AB This study introduces a practical work activity that allows students to investigate the inhibitory effects of seed extracts on pancreatic lipase activity. The activity is related to the issue of the ongoing global obesity epidemic and involves the use of materials and chemicals readily available in high school laboratories. We show how the activity can help students understand how scientists can control the reaction rates of key enzymes involved in the digestion of dietary fat, to combat obesity. The activity also illustrates how instructional scaffolding can help students understand important procedures related to the design, measurement, and handling of data which are critical in ensuring success among students performing scientific investigations.

DE nature of science; natural selection; lesson plan; middle school.
AB The discovery of and research into penicillin resistance by Sir Edward Abraham and Sir Ernst Chain can be used to teach the concept of natural selection and also multiple nature of science (NOS) objectives associated with Next Generation Science Standards, such as "scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence" and "science is a human endeavor." After a brief history of Abraham and Chain's work, we share a detailed multiday lesson plan and rationale for use in an eighth-grade in-person life science classroom. The instructional strategies discussed include analysis of excerpts of Abraham and Chain's published work through a case study jigsaw using an explicit and reflective approach to teaching NOS. The explicit approach used here is the direct instruction of NOS concepts, while the reflective approach allows students to think about and reflect on what they are learning. Instruction includes close reading, direct instruction, small and large group discussions, and writing. Students are asked to create a scavenger hunt map at the end of the multiday lesson and are assessed with an online five-question pre- and post-assessment.

AB Gene therapy has fascinated clinicians, scientists, and patients since decades ago because of its potential to treat a disease at the genetic level. This can be achieved in many ways, including replacing a disease-causing gene with a healthy copy. Gene therapy must overcome complex tissue and cellular barriers to introduce genetic modifications into the nucleus of the target cells to drive a high level of gene expression. Moreover, the genetically corrected cells must be present in significantly large numbers in the body to reverse the diseased condition and yet able to escape immunological recognition and survive in the long term to sustain the benefit. This paper reviews the early work as well as recent developments in gene therapy, including improvements to viral vectors and novel treatment strategies, diseases targeted, approved gene therapies, and current challenges and prospects for future progress.

AB The goal of this inquiry activity is to evaluate a variety of skin-care products on simulated skin cells using Orbeez, a brand of superabsorbent polymers. These small beads can quickly absorb water but will dry out in the air; thus perfectly representing our own skin cells. This property makes Orbeez an acceptable model for human skin, and test material for evaluating various skin-care products. Students will observe the quantitative changes that happened to the mass of the samples to determine the percent change. They will also observe the qualitative changes that happened throughout the lab investigation and record their observations in a lab notebook. After completing the experiment, students will create a presentation of the quantitative and qualitative results.

AB We investigated pre-service elementary teachers' engagement in science and English language arts (ELA) instruction integrated in the context of a children's book. Teachers developed models and conducted a compareand-contrast analysis after exposure to different accounts of the butterfly life cycle: a popular children's book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, and a scientific account from National Geographic called "Butterfly: A Life." The mixed-methods research was guided by the following question: What are the affordances and limitations of children's literature toward engendering an understanding of the butterfly life cycle for pre-service elementary teachers? Content analysis indicated that pre-service elementary teachers' abilities to compare and contrast the two accounts were not exceptional, as they failed to discriminate between ideas offered in the accounts and missed details of the key aspect of the butterfly life-cycle phenomenon: metamorphosis. However, the quality of participants' butterfly life-cycle models significantly increased after exposure to the scientific account. We suggest the potential for an additional ELA standard, asking and answering such questions as who, what, where, when, why, and how to demonstrate understanding of key details in a text, as a means for enhancing compare-and-contrast skills following these activities.

AB The field of epigenetics is progressing rapidly and becoming indispensable to the study of fundamental gene regulation. Recent advances are redefining our understanding of core components that regulate gene expression during development and in human diseases. Scientific knowledge on the importance of epigenetic regulation is now well known and accepted, and it is not surprising to see epigenetics being introduced into many biology curricula at the high school and college levels. Yet the core concepts of epigenetic regulation are differently perceived by the academic communities. Therefore, it is critical that fundamental concepts of epigenetic regulation are taught to the next generation in a simple yet precise manner to avoid any misconceptions. To that end, this article starts by distilling the extensive scientific literature on epigenetic control of gene regulation into a simple primer on the core fundamental concepts. Next and more importantly, it provides suggestions for student-friendly classroom practices and activities that are centered on these core concepts to ensure that students both recognize and retain knowledge on the importance of epigenetic control in eukaryotic gene regulation.

AB CRISPR (also known as CRISPR-Cas9) is a powerful biotechnology tool that gives scientis ts unprecedented access to the genetic makeup of all living organ isms, including humans. It originally evolved as an adaptive immune system in bacteria to defend against viruses. When artificially harnessed in the laboratory it allows scientists to accurately and precisely edit genes almost as if using a word processor. In mice, CRISPR has already been used to treat diabetes, muscular dystrophy, cancer, and blindness. CRISPR has made cultured human cells immune to HIV, and a variety of CRISPR experiments involving human embryos are well under way. But CRISPR is not limited to biomedical applications. It is also revolutionizing the food industry and many areas of biological research. It is imperative that science educators help prepare students for this compelling new era of biology. This article presents wet and dry lab simulations to help introduce high school and undergraduate students to CRISPR -based gene editing technology.

AB The terms Anthropocene and Homogenocene are frequently used to describe our current epoch, which is characterized by strong human impacts on the environment. One defining feature of the Anthro- or Homogenocene is biodiversity loss - experts say we are heading for Earth's sixth mass extinction. A crucial weapon in the battle against threats to biodiversity is education, particularly biodiversity literacy. Raising awareness of the social and environmental value of biodiversity, providing education on the concept of biodiversity, and promoting the ability to act may lead to active and responsible citizenship. We developed a biodiversity education teaching unit to promote biodiversity literacy through formal education. To make the topic of biodiversity tangible for students, our approach involves them in a citizen science project and uses the forest ecosystem to illustrate the relations between economic, ecological, and social aspects of biodiversity.

ID STUDENTS MISCONCEPTIONS; SCALE; AXONS; TIME
AB The elucidation of the principal features of chemical synaptic transmission has been one of the great achievements in the history of neuroscience, yet students have significant difficulties developing a deeper understanding of the underlying concept. This is particularly true for the role that diffusion of neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft plays in this process. At least part of the learning problem is due to an erroneous view of diffusion as a slow process, and to an inability to apply the concepts of size and scale to the synapse and its structural components. To overcome these difficulties, a structured/guided inquiry activity, combined with quantitative reasoning tasks, is described for teaching chemical synaptic transmission as part of undergraduate biology or neuroscience courses. Through this activity, students familiarize themselves with the absolute and relative dimensions of the structural components of synapses; use data from morphometric and schematic models of synapses to estimate the time it takes a neurotransmitter to diffuse across the synaptic cleft; and evaluate how this process relates to synaptic delay and generation of a sufficiently high concentration of transmitter molecules for activation of postsynaptic receptors.

AB What knowledge do you need to be an effective instructor? One key type of knowledge is pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), which includes awareness of how students are likely to think about a topic and where they will struggle as they learn that topic. We propose PCK as a valuable framework for reflecting on your own knowledge for teaching topics in evolution. We have created a searchable file that uses PCK as a framework to organize over 400 peer-reviewed papers from 40+ journals to give you better access to relevant resources for teaching evolution to undergraduates and advanced high school students. None of us have time to read 400 papers to inform our teaching so we provide tips to maximize your use of this collective knowledge in the time you have available. We have written these to be useful to instructors across career stages.

AB As an attempt to contribute to implementing scientific argumentation in classrooms, this study aimed to design an argumentation activity in which students were supported in engaging in the epistemic practices of scientific community. We reinterpreted prediction-observation-explanation strategy based on a resources perspective to acknowledge the role of students' prior knowledge in their construction of arguments and to consider students as active participants with epistemic authority. This argumentation activity was intended to encourage students to construct scientific concepts with valid justifications based on their conceptual resources. Specifically, the activity consisted of three stages: (a) prediction with justification: predicting the result of the task and justifying the prediction; (b) observation: conducting the task to gather firsthand data: and (c) explanation with justification: reconstructing a valid argument with justification. We implemented this activity in classrooms to investigate its practical outcomes with students. The students were able to construct a rigorous argument on their own, evaluating and revising their arguments based on the resources they already possessed and the data they gathered in the observation stage. The results of this research shed light on how to develop scientific argumentation activities that support students as epistemic agents having the ability to construct scientifically rigorous arguments.

TI The Use of Puppetry and Drama in the Biology Classroom
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER

DT Article
DE puppetry; epistemological border-crossing; social and ethical issues in
   biology; arts in the natural sciences; teaching for the affective domain
ID SCIENCE
AB Teachers often wonder how best to teach the myriad of social and ethical issues that are encompassed in the biology curriculum. One can just think of issues such as genetic engineering, evolution (and the continuous evolution-creationism debate), research ethics (the haunting book The immortal life of Henrietta Lacks comes to mind), human population studies, health care and nutrition, sexuality and gender, drugs, environmental pollution, to name but a few. In this article we highlight the advantages of puppetry in the biology classroom, as an engaging pedagogy that could assist conceptual change in students. We explore the dual epistemological border-crossing that takes place in the classroom when puppetry is used: (a) the integration of societal and ethical issues within the biology curriculum, and (b) the infusion of art and drama within the natural sciences. We reflect on our own classroom action research on puppetry, and share our main findings. We also provide practical guidelines for using puppetry as pedagogy within a problem-based and cooperative learning setting.

ID SELF-EFFICACY
AB Engaging and gauging (engauging) first-generation, under-represented minority undergraduate general biology students through processes of inquiry, critical thinking, and affective learning is vital as they develop their scientific identity. An important challenge is how we can establish communities of practice and instill in our first-generation students self-awareness and reflection as they apply, analyze, and evaluate data on biological principles. In my article, I describe an innovative weekly assignment for my first generation Hispanic and Native Indigenous students called Quizfolio: quiz and mini-portfolios on biological principles and themes outlined in Vision and Change. Within a SOAR framework that will be introduced in my article, quizfolios provide an active learning space for students to integrate inclusive student-centered, in-class discussions and longitudinal lab inquiries in a first-year undergraduate biology course through metacognition and reflection-in-action. This transformative, culturally responsive mentoring approach encourages first-generation undergraduates to bring self-awareness to unclear or confusing topics that are clarified at the start of class or lab settings, and provides future framework for long-term retention of biological concepts.

TI Modeling the Emergence of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacterial Populations
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE microbiology; evolution; modelling; antibiotic resistance; bacteria
ID EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY
AB Since antibiotics have become routinely used to treat infections, antibiotic resistance is now an emerging concern for public health. To understand how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, many students draw from the common misconception that bacteria gain resistance upon antibiotic exposure. We have designed models and a corresponding lab that explores how a population of bacteria can evolve antibiotic resistance, with emphasis on dispelling common misconceptions surrounding the mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Using an antibiotic disk diffusion assay, students compare the antibiotic resistance level of a harmless E. coli strain of bacteria over time. Then, students compare their lab data to the models, which together illustrate the roles that initial genetic variation and random mutation play in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. In this guided investigation, basic microbiology concepts and techniques are made accessible to students in a high school classroom. The models developed here are in line with the practices of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The models, together with the lab, are used to guide students through the process of argumentation using a claim, evidence, and reasoning (CER) format to explain the evolutionary mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.

AB Teaching the topic of genetics in relationship to ancestry and race generates many questions, and requires a teaching strategy that encourages perspective-based exploration and discussion. We have developed a set of dialogues for discussing the complex science of genetics, ancestry, and race that is contextualized in real human interactions and that contends with the social and ethical implications of this science. This article provides some brief historical and scientific context for these dialogues, describes their development, and relates how we have used them in different ways to engage diverse groups of science learners. The dialogue series can be incorporated into classroom or informal science education settings. After listening to or performing the dialogues and participating in a discussion, students will: (1) recognize misunderstandings about the relationship between DNA and race; (2) describe how DNA testing services assign geographic ancestry; (3) explain how scientific findings have been used historically to promote institutionalized racism and the role personal biases can play in science; (4) identify situations in their own life that have affected their understanding of genetics and race; and (5) discuss the potential consequences of the racialization of medicine as well as other fallacies about the connection of science and race.

SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Algal cell culture; inquiry-based lab; educative mentorship; authentic
   research; undergraduate research
AB This article features an authentic research-lab experience developed for use in a freshman-level general biology course for nonmajors at a two-year college. Students work in groups to select and investigate factors affecting microalgal cell growth and relate their findings to a real-life application of social significance. This lab experience was designed using a four-step pedagogical framework originally developed at a four-year university in a sophomore-level molecular and cell biology course. The creators of the pedagogical framework at the four-year university mentored the instructor at the two-year college through the process of using the pedagogical framework to design and implement the authentic research lab experience described in this article. This example shows that adaptation of successful pedagogical models, particularly within mentoring partnerships, can greatly increase the implementation of authentic research experiences in biology lab courses at varying levels of study.

ID SOCIAL PRACTICE; BIOLOGY; STUDENTS
AB Given the importance of succinctly communicating complex information, proficiency in graphing is a central element of scientific literacy. Evidence indicates that learners of all ages and levels of expertise have difficulties in displaying and reading visual data. Numerous studies have investigated the enactment of various activities to improve graphing in the college science classroom, but most of this work has focused on graphing difficulties and the implications of general instructional strategies as part of a semester-long curriculum. Few studies have discussed how specific interventions can be implemented to effectively hone graphing abilities. We evaluated ( 1) five key instructional features of an inquiry-oriented stream-ecology unit that consisted of data collection and graphing and (2) the unit's impact on nonscience majors' analytical skills. Comparing pretest and posttest data, as well as a supplemental questionnaire, student responses demonstrated substantial positive impacts on graphing skills and attitudes toward graphing. The results also highlighted features of the unit that were considered successful. Although we a describe a particular stream-ecology activity, the framework and design features we present can be applied to other case studies and across disciplines.

TI Evaluation of Educator & Student Use of & Attitudes toward Dissection &
   Dissection Alternatives
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Dissection; alternatives; education; student choice
ID LEARNING OUTCOMES
AB Animal dissection has been routinely practiced in American biology classrooms for decades. With technological advancements, more states adopting student choice measures, and increased awareness about ethical concerns surrounding dissection, many useful dissection alternatives have been developed. To understand the current use of animal dissection and alternatives, and attitudes toward the practices, a nationwide survey of middle and high school biology teachers (n = 1178) and students (n = 500) was conducted. Most teachers (84%) and students (76%) reported using dissection in their classrooms, although nearly half of educators indicated that dissection is decreasing at their school. Educators cited student performance as the main factor driving their decision to use dissection or alternatives and reported conducting dissection exercises because of student interest. Most teachers had an interest in using alternatives, although only 36% used them in place of dissection. More than a third of biology students preferred the use of alternatives over animal specimens, yet most did not request dissection alternatives. Enabling students to opt in to dissection exercises rather than opt out, as is the current practice, and educating teachers and students about student choice and the advantages of dissection alternatives are suggested strategies to reduce animal use in education, in line with the "3 R's" principle.

ID SOCIOECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
AB Our society is currently having serious debates about sources of energy and global climate change. But do students (and the public) have the requisite knowledge to engage these issues as informed citizenry? The learning-progression research summarized here indicates that only 10% of high school students typically have a level of understanding commensurate with that called for in the Next Generation Science Standards. The learning-progression research shows how most students fall short of being able to trace matter and energy through carbon-transforming processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and combustion that are at the center of analyses of energy use and global climate change. We discuss the more typical types of understanding that students develop and their implications for teaching.

AB Students who enter college with a solid grounding in, and positive attitudes toward, evolutionary science are better prepared for and achieve at higher levels in university-level biology courses. We found highly significant, positive relationships between student knowledge of evolution and attitudes toward evolution, as well as between introductory biology course achievement and both precourse acceptance of evolution and precourse knowledge of evolution, among students at a medium-sized private northeastern university. Teachers who scant the teaching of evolution or who do not foster good attitudes toward evolution are compromising their students' potential for success in science at the college level.

AB A fundamental component of science curricula is the understanding of scientific inquiry. Although recent trends favor using student inquiry to learn concepts through hands-on activities, it is often unclear to students where the line is drawn between the content and the process of science. This activity explicitly introduces students to the processes of science and allows the classroom to become a scientific community where independent studies are performed, shared, and revised. We designed this activity to be relatively independent of the chosen content, allowing instructors to utilize the presented framework for classes of various disciplines and education levels.

AB Both the old National Science Education Standards (NSES) and the recent Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) devote significant resources to learning about human environmental impact. Whereas the NSES advocate learning about human environmental impact in a section apart from the science-content learning strands, the NGSS embed them in the core life-science and ecology learning strands. We describe a study that compared the effects of these different approaches on ninth-grade biology student learning. It found that students learned significantly more human-environmental-impact and ecological-function content when human-impact content was embedded in ecology content than when human impact was taught as a discrete unit from ecology.

DE Genetics; non-Mendelian inheritance; polygenic inheritance;

AB Genetics is perhaps the most rapidly growing field of science today. Recent findings such as those of the Human Genome Project have led to new understandings of basic genetic phenomena and even to increased confusion about some basic genetic ideas, such as the nature of the gene. These developments directly influence how we should teach genetics. This article considers eight claims typically made by introductory biology teachers and considers how they differ from current understandings.

AB The evolution of complexity remains one of the most challenging topics in biology to teach effectively. We present a novel laboratory activity, modeled on a recent experimental breakthrough, in which students experimentally evolve simple multicellularity using single-celled yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). By simply selecting for faster settling through liquid media, yeast evolve to form snowflake-shaped multicelled clusters that continue to evolve as multicellular individuals. We present core experimental and curriculum tools, including discussion topics and assessment instruments, and provide suggestions for teacher customization. Prelab and postlab assessments demonstrate that this lab effectively teaches fundamental concepts about the transition to multicellularity. Yeast strains, the student lab manual, and an introductory presentation are available free of charge.

DE Inquiry-based activity; soil ecology; soil processes; soil physical
   properties; soil science
AB The Mystery Soil Lab, a playful, inquiry-based laboratory project, is designed to develop students' skills of inquiry, soil analysis, and synthesis of foundational concepts in soil science and soil ecology. Student groups are given the charge to explore and identify a "Mystery Soil" collected from a unique landscape within a 10-mile radius of our university by determining its soil formation and development history, associated plant community, and official taxonomic designation. Student groups have 4 consecutive weeks to conduct the lab assignment using observation and laboratory techniques. After 4 weeks, students present their findings by describing their process of inquiry, soil analysis results, and the conceptual reasoning behind their hypotheses using key course concepts. This project enhances students' abilities to conduct iterative science using the scientific method, improves foundational knowledge of soil properties and processes, and builds students' skills and confidence for a subsequent, independent soil ecology research project later in the semester.

DE Genome assembly; bioinformatics; computational biology; teaching tool
AB Next-generation sequencing technologies have greatly reduced the cost of sequencing genomes. With the current sequencing technology, a genome is broken into fragments and sequenced, producing millions of "reads." A computer algorithm pieces these reads together in the genome assembly process. PHAST is a set of online modules (http://gcat. davidson. edu/phast) designed to teach advanced high school and college students the genome assembly process. PHAST allows users to assemble phage genomes in real time and includes tutorials detailing the complexities of genome assembly. With PHAST, students learn concepts behind genome assembly and understand how mathematics solves biological problems such as genome assembly.

DE Scientific method; current events; hypothesis generation
AB We describe a short (<50 minutes) activity using news articles from sources such as Science Daily to teach students the steps of the scientific method and the difference between primary and secondary literature sources. The flexibility in choosing news articles to examine allowed us to tailor the activity to the specific interests of our student group. This exercise is particularly useful in situations where there is no laboratory component to a course, the time devoted to teaching the scientific method is constrained, or the topic is not presented adequately in the textbook utilized for the course.

AB Students should not graduate from high school without understanding that scientific debates are essential components of scientific methodology. This article presents a brief history of ongoing debates regarding the hypothesis that group selection is an evolutionary mechanism, and it serves as an example of the role that debates play in correcting faulty ideas and stimulating new research in the pursuit of extending scientific knowledge.

AB The discovery of a Victorian-era microscope slide titled "Grouped Flower Seeds" began an investigation into the scientific and historical background of the antique slide to develop its usefulness as a multidisciplinary tool for PowerPoint presentations usable in contemporary biology classrooms, particularly large-enrollment sections. The resultant presentation was intended to engage students in discussing historical and contemporary biology education, as well as some of the intricacies of seed biology. Comparisons between the usefulness and scope of various seed identification resources, both online and in print, were made.
