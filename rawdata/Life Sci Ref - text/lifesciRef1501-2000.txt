AB The evaluation process is complex and extremely important in the teaching/learning process. Evaluations are constantly employed in the classroom to assist students in the learning process and to help teachers improve the teaching process. The use of active methodologies encourages students to participate in the learning process, encourages interaction with their peers, and stimulates thinking about physiological mechanisms. This study examined the performance of medical students on physiology over four semesters with and without active engagement methodologies. Four activities were used: a puzzle, a board game, a debate, and a video. The results show that engaging in activities with active methodologies before a physiology cognitive monitoring test significantly improved student performance compared with not performing the activities. We integrate the use of these methodologies with classic lectures, and this integration appears to improve the teaching/learning process in the discipline of physiology and improves the integration of physiology with cardiology and neurology. In addition, students enjoy the activities and perform better on their evaluations when they use them.

AB The major challenge in laboratory teaching is the application of abstract concepts in simple and direct practical lessons. However, students rarely have the opportunity to participate in a laboratory that combines practical learning with a realistic research experience. In the Biomedical Engineering career, we offer short and optional courses to complement studies for students as they initiate their Graduation Project. The objective of these theoretical and practical courses is to introduce students to the topics of their projects. The present work describes an experience in electrophysiology to teach undergraduate students how to extract cortical information using electrocorticographic techniques. Students actively participate in some parts of the experience and then process and analyze the data obtained with different signal processing tools. In postlaboratory evaluations, students described the course as an exceptional opportunity for students interested in following a postgraduate science program and fully appreciated their contents.

AB The American Physiological Society (APS) Teaching Section annually honors an educator through its Claude Bernard Distinguished Lecture at the Experimental Biology meeting. Since I knew about my selection for almost a year, I had a long time to think about what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. The theme of my presentation was "nothing in education makes sense except in the light of student learning." My presentation began with a video of my "And, But, Therefore" description of my educational scholarship (see Randy Olson Great Challenges Day at TEDMED 2013, Ref. 10). "Physiology is the basic foundation of all the health professions AND physiology can be hard for students to figure out BUT many physiology courses expect students to memorize a large number of facts; THEREFORE, my scholarship is to help students learn physiology better for the long-term with various types of student-centered learning opportunities." To stress the goal of student-centered learning, my brief video was followed by a 2-min video of one of my students describing her experiences with student-centered learning in one of my two-semester Advanced Human Physiology classes. Since I have been convinced that Randy Olson is an expert on science communication (11), the rest of my presentation was the story about how I have evolved from a sage-on-the-stage lecturer into a student-centered learning facilitator. I have chosen Olson's "And, But, Therefore" approach to narrative for this written version of key aspects of the presentation.

AB The sheer amount of terminology and conceptual knowledge required for anatomy and physiology can be overwhelming for students. Educational games are one approach to reinforce such knowledge. In this activity, students worked collaboratively to review anatomy and physiology concepts by creating arrays of descriptive tiles to define a term. Once guessed, students located the structure or process within diagrams of the body. The game challenged students to think about course vocabulary in novel ways and to use their collective knowledge to get their classmates to guess the terms. Comparison of pretest/posttest/delayed posttest data revealed that students achieved statistically significant learning gains for each unit after playing the game, and a survey of student perceptions demonstrated that the game was helpful for learning vocabulary as well as fun to play. The game is easily adaptable for a variety of lower- and upper-division courses.

AB Venous return is a major determinant of cardiac output. Adjustments within the venous system are critical for maintaining venous pressure during loss in circulating volume. This article reviews two factors that are thought to enable the venous system to compensate during acute hemorrhage: 1) changes in venous elastance and 2) mobilization of unstressed blood volume into stressed blood volume. We show that mobilization of unstressed blood volume is the predominant and more effective mechanism in preserving venous pressure. Preservation of mean circulatory filling pressure helps sustain venous return and thus cardiac output during significant hemorrhage.

AB The aim of the present work was to transfer a wider concept of teamwork and self-learning to the laboratory, encouraging students' capabilities when seeking, acquiring, and processing knowledge. This educational innovation was carried out with a total of 38 students (fourth year of degree in Biology) in the area of physiology (Advances in Reproduction course) at University of Cordoba in Cordoba, Spain. The design of the project's application methodology consisted of establishing a way in which problems would be tackled in the practical classes. For this purpose, the different tasks were set up so that students could relate them to the concepts learned in the theory classes. On the first day of class, the project was presented to the students. Groups of two to three students worked in the laboratory and set up an outline of the protocol of the practical work that they had done. This outline was performed individually and sent to the lecturers through a learning management system (Moodle). The teachers gave feedback and assessed student submissions. Upon finishing the course, students completed a survey. The project-based learning method promotes practical self-learning on the part of students. This methodology demonstrated to us that it stimulates a critical and self-critical capacity in students, both individually and in groups, and that writing didactic practical material helped students to enhance their theory knowledge. The experiment was a success in view of the scores obtained upon finishing the subject.

AB Medical education reform is underway, but the optimal course for change has yet to be seen. While planning for the redesign of a renal physiology course at the Duke School of Medicine, the authors used a Q-sort survey to assess students' attitudes and learning preferences to inform curricular change. The authors invited first-year medical students at the Duke School of Medicine to take a Q-sort survey on the first day of renal physiology. Students prioritized statements related to their understanding of renal physiology, learning preferences, preferred course characteristics, perceived clinical relevance of renal physiology, and interest in nephrology as a career. By-person factor analysis was performed using the centroid method. Three dominant factors were strongly defined by learning preferences: "readers" prefer using notes, a textbook, and avoid lectures; "social-auditory learners" prefer attending lectures, interactivity, and working with peers; and "visual learners" prefer studying images, diagrams, and viewing materials online. A smaller, fourth factor represented a small group of students with a strong predisposition against renal physiology and nephrology. In conclusion, the Q-sort survey identified and then described in detail the dominant viewpoints of our students. Learning style preferences better classified first-year students rather than any of the other domains. A more individualized curriculum would simultaneously cater to the different types of learners in the classroom.

AB The aim of the present article is to describe a puzzle developed for use in teaching cardiac physiology classes. The puzzle presents figures of phases of the cardiac cycle and a table with five columns: phases of cardiac cycle, atrial state, ventricular state, state of atrioventricular valves, and pulmonary and aortic valves. Chips are provided for use to complete the table. Students are requested to discuss which is the correct sequence of figures indicating the phases of cardiac cycle. Afterward, they should complete the table with the chips. Students of biology, dentistry, medicine, pharmacy, and nursing graduation courses from seven institutions performed the puzzle evaluation. They were invited to indicate whether the puzzle had been useful for learning about the subject by filling one of four alternatives. Of the students, 4.6% answered that it was not necessary but helped them to confirm what they had learned, 64.5% reported that although they had previously understood the cardiac cycle, the puzzle helped them to solve doubts and promoted a better understanding of it, and 30.9% said that they needed the puzzle to understand the cardiac cycle, without differences among courses, institutions, and course semesters. The results of the present study suggest that a simple and inexpensive puzzle may be useful as an active learning methodology applied after the theoretical lecture, as a complementary tool for studying cardiac cycle physiology.

AB The fact that humans possess fast- and slow-twitch muscle in the ratio of similar to 50% has profound implications for designing exercise training strategies for power and endurance activities. With the growth of exercise and sport science courses, we have seen the need to develop an undergraduate student laboratory that demonstrates the basic properties of fast-and slow-twitch mammalian skeletal muscle. This laboratory illustrates the major differences in contractile properties and fatigue profiles exhibited by the two muscle types. Students compare and contrast twitch kinetics, fused tetanus characteristics, force-frequency relationships, and fatigue properties of fast-and slow-twitch muscles. Examples of results collected by students during class are used to illustrate the type of data collected and analysis performed. During the laboratory, students are encouraged to connect factual information from their skeletal muscle lectures to their laboratory findings. This enables student learning in an active fashion; in particular, the isolated muscle preparation demonstrates that much of what makes muscle fast or slow is myogenic and not the product of the nervous or circulatory systems. This has far-reaching implications for motor control and exercise behavior and therefore is a crucial element in exercise science, with its focus on power and endurance sport activities. To measure student satisfaction with this active learning technique, a questionnaire was administered after the laboratory; 96% of the comments were positive in their support of active versus passive learning strategies.

ID FIBER
AB In electrophysiology studies, it is becoming increasingly common to explain experimental observations using both descriptive methods and quantitative approaches. However, some electrophysiological phenomena, such as the generation of extracellular potentials that results from the propagation of the excitation source along the muscle fiber, are difficult to describe and conceptualize. In addition, most traditional approaches aimed at describing extracellular potentials consist of complex mathematical machinery that gives no chance for physical interpretation. The aim of the present study is to present a new method to teach the formation of extracellular potentials around a muscle fiber from both a descriptive and quantitative perspective. The implementation of this method was tested through a written exam and a satisfaction survey. The new method enhanced the ability of students to visualize the generation of bioelectrical potentials. In addition, the new approach improved students' understanding of how changes in the fiber-to-electrode distance and in the shape of the excitation source are translated into changes in the extracellular potential. The survey results show that combining general principles of electrical fields with accurate graphic imagery gives students an intuitive, yet quantitative, feel for electrophysiological signals and enhances their motivation to continue their studies in the biomedical engineering field.

Adv Physiol Educ 37: 70-79, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00138.2012.-Most scientists agree that comprehension of primary scientific papers and communication of scientific concepts are two of the most important skills that we can teach, but few undergraduate biology courses make these explicit course goals. We designed an undergraduate neuroimmunology course that uses a writing-intensive format. Using a mixture of primary literature, writing assignments directed toward a layperson and scientist audience, and in-class discussions, we aimed to improve the ability of students to 1) comprehend primary scientific papers, 2) communicate science to a scientific audience, and 3) communicate science to a layperson audience. We offered the course for three consecutive years and evaluated its impact on student perception and confidence using a combination of pre- and postcourse survey questions and coded open-ended responses. Students showed gains in both the perception of their understanding of primary scientific papers and of their abilities to communicate science to scientific and layperson audiences. These results indicate that this unique format can teach both communication skills and basic science to undergraduate biology students. We urge others to adopt a similar format for undergraduate biology courses to teach process skills in addition to content, thus broadening and strengthening the impact of undergraduate courses.

This communication describes experiences related to an interactive video used in exercise science and general biology courses to help students become aware of, sensitive to, and comfortable with implementing professional ethics into their own thinking and behavior as researchers before entering the laboratory. The activity consisted of a filmed exercise physiology experiment complemented with interactive question sheets followed by small-and large-group discussion and culminating with individual student reflections. Student written responses from multiple courses indicated that students were able to 1) identify and consider the ethics of experimenter-subject interactions from the movie, 2) generalize broader ideas of professional ethics from those observations, and 3) consider their observations in terms of future experiments they would be conducting personally and how they should interact with human subjects. A majority of students indicated a positive reaction to the video and identified specific aspects they appreciated. It is hoped that this report will encourage other instructors to consider the use of interactive videos in the teaching and learning of professional ethics related to their courses.

AB Kommalage M, Gunawardena S. Evaluation of physiology lectures conducted by students: comparison between evaluation by staff and students. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 48-52, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00091.2010.-As a peer-assisted learning process, minilectures on physiology were conducted by students. During this process, students lecture to their colleagues in the presence of faculty staff members. These lectures were evaluated by faculty staff and students simultaneously. The aim of this study was to compare feedback from faculty members and students on 66 minilectures conducted by students. Their perception of different qualities of lecture was assessed using a questionnaire. There were significant correlations between students and faculty members for many qualities of the lecture, including the speed of the lecture, retaining attention, clear introduction, and the overall quality of the lecture. However, ratings for gesture, eye contact, language usage, illustration usage, audiovisuals, voice usage, and important points stressed were significantly different between students and faculty members. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the degree of effect of different aspects of a lecture on its overall quality. Aspects such as gesture, eye contact, and language usage showed very low beta-values, suggesting a poor contribution of these factors to the overall quality of the lecture for both students and faculty members. The speed of the lecture, retaining attention, and clear introduction were qualities that faculty members and students rated equally, and these were the main contributors to the overall quality of the lecture. Awareness about the possible discrepancy between ratings given by faculty members and students may be important when interpreting the evaluation results of formal lectures by these two groups.

AB Chamberland V, Rioux P. Not only students can express alcohol dehydrogenase: goldfish can too! Adv Physiol Educ 34: 222-227, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00088.2009.-This article describes a novel approach to study the metabolic regulation of the respiratory system in vertebrates that suits physiology lessons for undergraduate students. It consists of an experimental demonstration of the goldfish's (Carassius auratus) adaptations to anoxia. The goldfish is one of the few vertebrates showing strong enzymatic plasticity for the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which allows it to survive long periods of severe anoxia. Therefore, we propose two simple laboratory exercises in which students are first asked to characterize the distribution of ADH isozymes in the goldfish by performing cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The second part of this laboratory lesson is the determination of liver glycogen. To further student comprehension, an interspecies comparative component is integrated, in which the same subjects are studied in an anoxia-sensitive species, the brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis). ADH in goldfish is restricted to skeletal muscles, where it catalyzes alcoholic fermentation, permitting ethanol excretion through the gills and therefore preventing lactate acidosis caused by sustained glycolysis during anoxia. Electrophoresis also reveals the occurrence of a liver isozyme in the brook charr, which ADH catalyzes in the opposite pathway, allowing the usual ethanol degradation. As for the liver glycogen assay, it shows largely superior content in the goldfish liver compared with the brook charr, providing goldfish with a sustained energy supply during anoxia. The results of this laboratory exercise clearly demonstrate several physiological strategies developed by goldfish to cope with such a crucial environmental challenge as oxygen depletion.

AB McElduff F, Cortina-Borja M, Chan SK, Wade A. When t-tests or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests won't do. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 128-133, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00017.2010.-t-Tests are widely used by researchers to compare the average values of a numeric outcome between two groups. If there are doubts about the suitability of the data for the requirements of a t-test, most notably the distribution being non-normal, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test may be used instead. However, although often applied, both tests may be invalid when discrete and/or extremely skew data are analyzed. In medicine, extremely skewed data having an excess of zeroes are often observed, representing a numeric outcome that does not occur for a large percentage of cases (so is often zero) but which also sometimes takes relatively large values. For data such as this, application of the t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test could lead researchers to draw incorrect conclusions. A valid alternative is regression modeling to quantify the characteristics of the data. The increased availability of software has simplified the application of these more complex statistical analyses and hence facilitates researchers to use them. In this article, we illustrate the methodology applied to a comparison of cyst counts taken from control and steroid-treated fetal mouse kidneys.

AB Clinical Physiology 1 and 2 are flipped classes in which students watch prerecorded videos before class. During the 3-h class, students take practice assessments, work in groups on critical thinking exercises, work through case studies, and engage in drawing exercises. Due to the COVID pandemic, these courses were transitioned from in-person classes to online classes. Despite the university's return-to-class policy, some students were reluctant to return to in-person classes; therefore during the 2021-2022 academic year, Clinical Physiology 1 and 2 were offered as flipped, hybrid courses. In a hybrid format, students either attended the synchronous class in person or online. Here we evaluate the learning outcomes and the perceptions of the learning experience for students who attended Clinical Physiology 1 and 2 either online (2020-2021) or in a hybrid format (2021-2022). In addition to exam scores, in-class surveys and end of course evaluations were compiled to describe the student experience in the flipped hybrid setting. Retrospective linear mixed-model regression analysis of exam scores revealed that a hybrid modality (2021-2022) was associated with lower exam scores when controlling for sex, graduate/undergraduate status, delivery method, and the order in which the courses were taken (F test: F = 8.65, df1 = 2, df2 = 179.28, P = 0.0003). In addition, being a Black Indigenous Person of Color (BIPOC) student is associated with a lower exam score, controlling for the same previous factors (F test: F = 4.23, df1 = 1, df2 = 130.28, P = 0.04), albeit with lower confidence; the BIPOC representation in this sample is small (BIPOC: n = 144; total: n = 504). There is no significant interaction between the hybrid modality and race, meaning that BIPOC and White students are both negatively affected in a hybrid flipped course. Instructors should consider carefully about offering hybrid courses and build in extra student support.

ID REFLECTIONS; FACULTY
AB Core concepts in physiology, designed by physiology educators to promote improved learning and teaching, have existed for over a decade. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which a set of 15 core concepts of physiology (developed by Michael and McFarland, U.S.-based educators) are reflected in the learning outcomes (LOs) of units (subjects) comprising physiol-ogy curricula in Australian universities. From publicly accessible online information, we identified 17 Australian universities that offered a physiology major for undergraduate degree students and downloaded 788 LOs from the 166 units that comprised the majors. Each LO was blindly mapped against the 15 core concepts by 8 physiology educators from 3 Australian universities. Additionally, text-matching software was employed to match keywords and phrases (identified as descriptors of the 15 core con-cepts) against the LOs. The frequency of individual words and two-word phrases for each core concept was calculated and ranked. There was variability in rating LOs for the same university among academic mappers; nevertheless, many of the 15 core concepts did not appear to be adequately covered in the LOs. Two core concepts most matched manually were in the top three most mapped by the software. These were, from most common, structure/function and interdependence. Our findings suggest a lack of alignment of LOs with the core concepts across Australian physiology curricula. This highlights the need for Australia -wide agreement on a set of core concepts in physiology as the first step in collaboratively improving assessment and learning and teaching practice in physiology. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first time an existing set of core concepts for physiology, developed by Michael and McFarland (U.S.-based educators), have been mapped against unit (subject) learning outcomes across physiology curricula in Australian universities to gauge uptake and the need for agreement on a set of core concepts in the Australian higher education context.

ID HOMEOSTASIS
AB This article will 1) initially outline first-year nursing and undergraduate exercise sciences student perspectives on examinations of the 2011 Michael-McFarland (M-M2011) core principles in physiology through an anonymous online survey, and 2) model an updated approach based on these qualitative findings. Briefly, for the first perspective (i of iii), 93.70% of the 127 respondents answered whether "homeostasis" was important to understanding healthcare topics or diseases introduced in the course agreed; this matches the M-M2011 rankings. A close second was "interdependence" at 93.65% (of 126 responses). However, in this regard "cell membrane" was identified as least important (which is in contrast with the 2011 M-M rankings, as "cell mem-brane" tied as the no. 1 ranked core principle) with only 66.93% (of 127 responses) agreeing. The next perspective (ii; in prepara-tion for physiology topics on licensure exams), "interdependence" topped the list with 91.13% (of 124 respondents) agreeing to its importance. For the second (ii) perspective, "structure/function" had 87.10% (of 124 respondents) in agreement, with "homeosta-sis" in a near tie (86.40% of 125 responses). Again, "cell membrane" was the least with only 52.38% (of 126 student responses) agreeing. For the third perspective (iii; careers in healthcare), again "cell membrane" trailed at 51.20% (of 125 responses) agree-ing to its importance, with "interdependence" (88.80% of 125 responses), with "structure/function" (87.20% of 125 responses) and "homeostasis" (86.40% of 125 responses) topping the list of important concepts (principles) needed for careers in health-care. Finally, the author presents a "Top Ten" List of Core Principles of Human Physiology for Undergraduate Health Professions students, based on the survey. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article will 1) outline prelicensure nursing and exercise sciences student perspective examinations of the 2011 Michael-McFarland (M-M 2011) core principles in physiology through an anonymous online survey, and 2) model an updated approach largely based on qualitative survey responses from first-year nursing students. As a result, the author presents a "Top Ten" List of Core Principles of Human Physiology for Undergraduate Health Professions students.

AB Vascular diseases of the legs are highly prevalent and constitute an important part of medical curricula. The understanding of these diseases relies on strongly interwoven aspects of vascular physiology and vascular medicine. We aimed to connect these within a horizontally integrated laboratory class on vascular physiology of the leg that was designed in cooperation between the departments of physiology and vascular surgery. Conceptually, we applied examination techniques of vascular medicine to visu-alize physiological parameters that are altered by the most frequent diseases. This facilitates integrative discussions on malfunc-tions, trains diagnostic skills, and bridges to vascular medicine. In four experiments, we use oscillometry and impedance venous occlusion plethysmography to address key aspects of the arterial and venous system of the legs: 1) arterial pulse wave, 2) arte-rial systolic blood pressure, 3) venous capacitance and venous outflow, and 4) reactive hyperemia. After the experiments, physio-logical vascular function, the associated diseases, their impact on the recorded parameters, and diagnostic options are discussed. To allow reproduction, we describe the course structure and the experimental setup in detail. We present the experi-mental data of a cohort of medical students and document learning success and student satisfaction. All experiments were feasi-ble and provided robust data on physiologically and clinically relevant vascular functions. The activity was perceived positively by the students and led to a substantial improvement of knowledge. With this work, we offer a template for reproduction or vari-ation of a proven concept of horizontally integrated teaching of vascular physiology of the leg.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article presents an integrative laboratory class on vascular physiology bridging to vascular medicine. The four experiments rely on oscillometry and venous occlusion plethysmography. We describe in detail this new class regarding structure, experimental setup, and experimental procedure, and we give insight into the applied materials. Moreover, we present the experimental data of 74 students and a quantitative evaluation of the students' learning success and acceptance.

AB The year 2023 marks the 300th anniversary of the death of Antonio Maria Valsalva (1666-1723). Valsalva was a leading physician across the 17th and 18th centuries, specifically for his focus on experimental physiology, the science dealing with the normal functioning of bodily organs as a basis for a better understanding of diseases, symptoms, and care. He used a top-down systematic approach typical of the Enlightenment, rather than a heuristic one ("trial-and-error"), which became feasible after the long-lasting ban on dissecting human corpses was lifted. Valsalva's main interest was exploring the complex structure of the human ear, to which he dedicated a specific treatise, De Aure Humana. He understood the issues inherent in the imbalance in pressure between the outer and inner ear and found ways to exploit it to get rid of purulent fluid by deliberately raising the inside pressure with his maneuver. Time was however not yet ripe to see the broader importance that the Valsalva maneuver would achieve, not just in otorhinolaryngology, but also in cardiology and other fields of medicine. Although Valsalva's name is usually associated with his maneuver, his contributions to the history of medicine were broader: he discovered several anatomical parts (i.e., the sinuses of Valsalva), built the basis for the development of pathological anatomy, introduced advances in surgery, and promoted compassionate care of patients affected by mental diseases.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Antonio Maria Valsalva (1666-1723) was a pioneer in experimental physiology between the 17th and 18th centuries. The Valsalva maneuver is still a popular academic topic and has broad applications not only in physiology research, but also in the diagnosis and therapy of various diseases. The celebration of 300 years from his death could be a timely occasion to commemorate the scientific works of this illustrious scientist.

AB Due to the COVID-19 pandemic during spring semester 2020, teachers and students were forced to engage in online instruction. However, there is little evidence on the feasibility of online physiology teaching. This study demonstrated a 3-wk preliminary online physiology course based on Rain Classroom assisted by the mobile application WeChat. Eighty-seven nursing undergraduate students attended an online physiology course during the spring semester of the 2019-2020 academic year from March 9 to March 29. We determined the effects of the online physiology learning based on in-class tests, preclass preparation, and review rates for the course materials. We also measured the students' perceptions and attitudes about online learning with a questionnaire survey. Posttest scores from the first week to the third week in online physiology course (7.22 +/- 1.83, 7.68 +/- 2.09, and 6.21 +/- 2.92, respectively) exceeded the pretest scores (5.32 +/- 2.14, 6.26 +/- 2.49, and 3.72 +/- 2.22, respectively), and this finding was statistically significant (all P < 0.001). Moreover, the pretest scores were significant positive predictors of final grade (all P < 0.01). In addition, the percentage of preclass preparation increased in 3 wk, from 43.68% to 57.47% to 68.97%. From the first week to the third week, the review rate increased from 86.21% to 91.95%; however, the second week was the lowest of all (72.41%). Finally, students' perceptions about their online physiology learning experiences were favorable. In conclusion, online physiology instruction based on Rain Classroom assisted by WeChat was an effective strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB A digital mobile card-matching game called eFlip was developed to assist second-year undergraduate medical science students to learn core content and understand key associations in physiology. Our team developed customized content of core physiological associations, of increasing difficulty, for upload on a generic card-matching platform. The generic game was extended with add-ons coded to allow identification and access of student usage data for students who consented to have their game usage linked to academic performance such as final course marks and grades. Here, we describe the development of the eFlip game content, the student usage profile, and the game's impact on learning. Students were invited to use eFlip prior to and during the final examination period. Of those who used eFlip, 152 students consented to participate in a study of game use on learning performance outcomes. Within the students who consented, 74 played the game and 78 did not play the game (nonplayers). The mean course mark of the students who played the game [69.57%; 95% confidence level (CI) (67.22, 71.92)] was higher than that of the nonplayers [65.33%; 95% CI (62.67, 67.99)] (P = 0.02). Playing eFlip was also associated with reduced failure rates in students who played the game (1% failure rate) compared with the students who did not play the game (10% failure rate; P = 0.02). The number of games played by students peaked just prior to the course final examination. Overall, students who chose to play eFlip demonstrated improved grades that were associated with a higher probability of passing the physiology course.

AB Appalachia has low rates of college attendance and graduation, but relevant data investigating student attrition from physiology majors in this region are lacking. This exploratory study examined freshman attrition from an undergraduate exercise physiology program in Appalachia with the goal of identifying potential strategies for improving retention across similar programs in this underserved region. Questionnaires were administered at the beginning and end of the fall semester to freshman (n = 247) and students transferring out of the major [Transferred group (T); n = 50] by the end of their first semester were compared against those that remained [Retained group (R); n = 190]. The Transferred group was invited to participate in qualitative interviews. Fewer Transferred students reported feeling underprepared in academic preparedness skills, but more reported feeling underprepared in math. At the end of the semester, more in the Transferred group reported doing worse than expected in math and in getting good grades and had a lower grade point average (R: 3.27 +/- 0.05; T: 2.62 +/- 0.15; P < 0.01). More in the Transferred group were first-generation (FG) college students (R: 17%; T: 30%). Transferred FG had lower academic preparation and performance and more financial need than Retained FG. In interviews (n = 35), most students expressed a change in career goals and many noted the academic rigor of the program, while academic advising, faculty, and the major received generally positive praise. This study identified several factors that would allow for early identification of incoming freshmen at risk for attrition and proposes strategies for improving retention within Appalachian physiology programs.

AB Biology education research often utilizes the terms learning, memorizing, studying, and understanding without providing their specific definition. When definitions have been provided, they are often inconsistent across publications. As part of a larger research study, we interviewed 11 participants on 2 occasions while they were enrolled in a sequence of anatomy and physiology courses. Part of the interview protocol asked participants for their definitions of learning, memorizing, studying, and understanding. Definitions were isolated from the transcript, deidentified, and sorted by qualitative similarities. The research team developed code categories and assigned definitions to these groups after discussing coding differences. Multiple definition groups emerged for each term. Learning, memorizing, and studying definition groups highlighted processes, outcomes, or a combination of both a process and outcome. Understanding definition groups focused solely on an outcome. These findings highlight the need for communication between students and instructors with regard to term usage. In addition, future research in biology and physiology education should be careful to provide working definitions of these terms to ensure communicative and interpretive validity and to promote transferability and repeatability of findings.

AB The core problem of Chinese resident doctor training is that medical educators present content in an attractive teaching mode to make students more motivated to learn and improve their clinical thinking ability, humanistic care, and practical ability. The traditional classroom mode of teaching cannot meet the needs of modern medical education. The purpose of this study is to explore the benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom (FC) combined with case- and team-based learning (FC-CTBL) for residency training. In this study, 60 junior surgical residents of Xiangya Medical College were enrolled. "Diabetic foot" was selected as the content of this study. Residents were divided into an FC-CTBL group and an FC group. FC-CTBL and FC were compared on the basis of residents' feedback questionnaires, residents' learning burden, test scores from a pre-quiz, and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE). Residents were more satisfied with the FC-CTBL model compared with FC. In the FC-CTBL group, more participants said that the course improved their teamwork skills, analytical skills and their confidence in tackling unfamiliar problems. Residents in the FCCTBL group also spent significantly less time preparing for class and performed better in the OSCE than those in the FC group. FCCTBL stimulates residents' learning motivation, decreases their workload, improves their performance in the OSCE and may help to enhance clinical thinking and teamwork skills. The FC-CTBL approach is a good option for residency training.

AB Multiple choice exams are ubiquitous, but advice on test-taking strategies varies and is not always well informed by research. This study evaluated the question of whether students benefit or are harmed when they change their initial answers on multiple choice questions in the context of physiology and biology courses. Previously marked examinations were reviewed for eraser marks that indicated answer changes, and the impact of these changes on exam grades was tabulated. In addition, faculty and students were surveyed for their opinions about changing answers. A plurality of faculty (36%) reported a belief that answer changes usually harm student grades, whereas a slim majority of students (51%) believed that answer changing helped their scores (chi(2)=60.52, P < 0.0001). Empirically, across two exams, students changed their answer from an incorrect answer to a correct one 2.8 times (SD 2.2) compared with 1.0 time (SD 1.4) changing in the negative direction. Therefore, on average, students benefited (V=123.5, P < 0.0001) from answer changing. Furthermore, comparing across two exams in the same course, some students were consistently more likely to change their answers than others (adjusted R-2 = 0.23, P < 0.0001), but the impact of changing answers on the first exam provided no prediction of how much a student would benefit from answer changing on the second exam (adjusted R-2 = -0.004, P = 0.42). These data support the argument that students should be advised to review and revise responses to exam questions before submitting them.

AB Medical education has gone online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Formative assessment is essential to facilitate the learning process in medical education. However, various challenges arise during online assessment, which include reliability, when done without monitoring and practical concerns like Internet connectivity issues. This study was done to assess the medical students' perceptions of the reliability, usefulness, and practical challenges of online tests. One hundred first-year undergraduate medical students taking up online classes and tests in the subject of physiology were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire with items regarding practical challenges, reliability, and usefulness of the online tests, in general, and about different types of online assessment methods, in particular, were sent to the students online. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale, and the responses were analyzed anonymously. A large percentage of students used mobile phones (81.4%) to undertake online tests. Although most students (73.2%; P < 0.001) felt that online tests helped them substantially in learning the subject, network connectivity issues were considered to be a matter of serious concern (85.5%, P < 0.001). Among the assessment methods used, viva voce by video conferencing was thought to be most reliable (83%, P < 0.001). Multiple-choice question-based assessment when done online was felt to be more practically feasible with faster feedback than classroom assessment. The results of the study suggest that medical students find online formative assessments helpful for their learning, despite their concerns about reliability and practical challenges.

AB Journal club (JC) is an integral part of postgraduate medical education. Although several innovations have been attempted to improve its effectiveness, the influence of the number of sessions remains unexplored. The current study investigated the effect of the number of sessions (one vs. four) of conduction of journal club on critical appraisal skills of postgraduate students at two institutions. A quasi-experimental study was conducted comparing the effectiveness of JC in a one- versus four-session JC format using two objective tests: Critical Appraisal Skills Test (CAST) and Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) score. The degree of changes (pre-JC vs. post-JC session) after each format exposure, association of prescores to postscores, and correlation between the CAST and PICO scores were discerned. CAST score was higher in the four-session format (P = 0.03), whereas PICO score increased in the single-session format of JC (P = 0.03). Also, the change in CAST score was higher in the four-session versus single-session JC format (P = 0.04). We conclude that a four-session format of JC is more effective in augmenting critical appraisal skills of postgraduate students, whereas a single session is sufficient for improving factual knowledge.

AB Physiology undergraduate degree programs operate in isolation relative to other biological science programs, with little to no understanding of how other institutions structure their course requirements and other degree requirements. The purpose of this report is to preliminarily describe the collective curriculum of physiology programs represented at the Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG) annual meetings from 2018 to 2019. A short preconference survey was sent to attendees that inquired about degree requirements of their respective physiology programs. The requirement for Physiology I (69.2%) with laboratory (66.7%) and Anatomy I (57.1%) with laboratory (42.9%), or combined Anatomy and Physiology I (16.7%) and laboratory (18.2%), were common requirements, but many programs did not require Physiology II (27.3%) or Anatomy II (11.1%). There was nearly consensus on required prerequisites such as Biology (2 semesters with laboratories, 85.7%), Chemistry (2 semesters with laboratory, 88.9%), Physics (2 semesters with laboratory, 75%), Calculus I (61.1%), and Statistics (Biostatistics 42.9%; General Statistics 13.3%). There was less agreement among programs in regards to Calculus II (20.0%), Organic Chemistry (2 semesters, 55.6%), and Biochemistry I (47%), which may be reflective of individual department focus. There was considerable heterogeneity among physiology program course requirements for disciplinary core courses and upper division electives. This report is meant to generate discussion on physiology program curricula in efforts to improve physiology education for majors and assist P-MIG in determining minimal points of consensus as they write the first set of national curricular guidelines for degree programs.

AB Learning anatomy and physiology at university can be challenging, as students need to understand both the language of the discipline and complex topics, such as system integration. Yet learning strategies arc rarely taught at university, making it difficult for students to adopt new strategies. if their approach to learning has not been effective or efficient. This study evaluated the use of small-group peer discussion boards as an avenue for sharing learning strategies between students in a first-year anatomy and physiology course. The majority of students (91%) identified strategies from the discussion board worth trying before they completed the midsemester exam. The most frequently reported type of strategy was transforming records. By the end of semester, 76% of students had adopted at least one new strategy; however, these students performed significantly worse on the exam compared with students who did not adopt new strategies. The students who adopted new strategies learned about them from peers (33%), the discussion board (32%). or through self-discovery (32%). The majority of students (83%) found the discussion boards to be useful as a source of new learning strategies and for insight into how others learn. Although the discussion boards provided an avenue for students to learn about new strategies from each other, further guidance from instructors may be required to help students evaluate the effectiveness of these learning strategies.

AB Today most education institutions around the world have adopted the philosophy of outcome-based education. The emphasis in outcome-based education is achievement of outcomes; hence the curriculum should be designed in a way that it includes the components targeted specifically at achieving these outcomes. A discipline-based approach results in fragmentation of learning and lack of clinical applicability. Integrated teaching could be a solution to achieve required outcomes in a holistic way. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate an integrated teaching module. Temporal coordination of the basic sciences, along with correlation of learned topics to clinical settings, was done in the first year of the undergraduate medical program. The module was evaluated by obtaining qualitative and quantitative feedback from students. Student assessment was conducted with a test that had case vignettes and multiple-choice questions. In addition, students' change in learning approaches and self-directed learning readiness were collected. Students' perception regarding the educational environment was also obtained. Analysis of the data showed positive feedback from the students regarding the integrated teaching. Students' average score in the test was 86%. There was a significant increase in the scores for the deep approach and self-directed learning readiness in the posttest compared with the pretest. Moreover, students were found to be satisfied with the educational environment. Evaluation of integrated teaching revealed that it was well accepted by the students. Moreover, it facilitated the achievement of the students' outcomes.

AB The aim of the study was to explore the factors associated with the recall of basic medical physiology knowledge among medical interns and to determine the level of retained basic science knowledge. Two hundred and four interns, 114 women and 90 men, working in two major tertiary medical care centers, King Fahad Medical City (KFMC; 29 students) and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH; 117 students), in Riyadh city, participated in the study. An anonymous knowledge test with 10 validated multiple-choice questions was developed specifically for this purpose. One hundred and forty-six interns (117 working at KKUH and 29 at KFMC) had graduated from medical schools adopting a conventional instructional system, whereas 58 (3 from KKUH and 55 from KFMC had graduated from schools adopting an integrated system (hybrid problem-based learning). Fifty-two students (26%) gained a score >= 60%, whereas 152 students (74%) obtained <60% of the score. Higher scores were associated with younger age (P < 0.01), traditional curriculum (P < 0.001), interns from KKUH (P < 0.001), and candidates for postgraduate studies (P < 0.02). There was no significant association between recall of physiology knowledge and all other variables studied, including sex. Multivariate analyses show that age and traditional curriculum are the only significant predictors of knowledge retention. Almost three-fourths of the interns scored <60%, and higher scores were significantly associated with younger interns, traditional curriculum, working in KKUH, and interns preparing for graduate studies. However, the difference between the two curricula disappears when the influence of hospital training is considered.

TI Retrieval practice in the form of online homework improved information

AB Studies have shown that practicing temporally spaced retrieval of previously learned information via formal assessments increases student retention of the information. Our objective was to determine the impact of online homework administered as a first retrieval practice 1 or 5 days after introduction of physiology topics on long-term information retention. Students in two undergraduate courses, Anatomy and Physiology (ASCI 240) and Animal Physiological Systems (ASCI 340). were presented with information on a specific physiological system during each weekly laboratory and then completed an online homework assignment either 1 or 5 days later. Information retention was assessed via an in-class quiz the following week and by a comprehensive final exam at semester's end (4-13 wk later). Performance on homework assignments was generally similar between groups for both courses. Information retention at 1 wk did not differ due to timing of homework in either course. In both courses, however, students who received homework 5 days after class performed better on final exam questions relevant to that week's topic compared with their day 1 counterparts. These findings indicate that the longer period between introducing physiology information in class and assigning the first retrieval practice was more beneficial to long-term information retention than the shorter period, despite seemingly equivalent benefits in the shorter term. Since information is typically forgotten over time. we speculate that the longer interval necessitates greater retrieval effort in much the same way as built-in desirable difficulties, thus allowing for stronger conceptual connections and deeper comprehension.

ID LUNG-FUNCTION; POPULATIONS; US
AB Spirometers are used globally to diagnose respiratory diseases, and most commercially available spirometers "correct" for race. "Race correction" is built into the software of spirometers. To evaluate pulmonary function and to make recordings, the operator must enter the subject's race. In fact, the Joint Working Party of the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society recommends the use of race-and ethnic-specific reference values. In the United States, spirometers apply correction factors of 10-15% for individuals labeled "Black" and 4-6% for people labeled "Asian." Thus race is purported to be a biologically important and scientifically valid category. However, history suggests that race corrections may represent an implicit bias, discrimination, and racism. Furthermore, this practice masks economic and environmental factors. The flawed logic of innate, racial difference is also considered with disability estimates, preemployment physicals, and clinical diagnoses that rely on the spirometer. Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (1832) may have initiated this mistaken belief by noting deficiencies of the "pulmonary apparatus" of blacks. Plantation physicians used Jefferson's statement to support slavery, believing that forced labor was a way to "vitalize the blood" of deficient black slaves. Samuel Cartwright, a Southern physician and slave holder, was the first to use spirometry to record deficiencies in pulmonary function of blacks. A massive study by Benjamin Apthorp Gould (1869) during the Civil War validated his results. The history of slavery created an environment where racial difference in lung capacity become so widely accepted that race correction became a scientifically valid procedure.

AB Didactic lectures are prevalent in physiology courses within veterinary medicine programs, but more active learning methods have also been utilized. Our goal was to identify the most appropriate learning method to augment the lecture component of our physiology course. We hypothesized that case-based learning would be well received by students and would be more effective at helping them learn physiological concepts compared with more traditional laboratory exercises. In this study, approximately one-half of the laboratory sessions for the two-semester course were dedicated to traditional hands-on laboratory exercises, whereas the remaining one-half of the sessions were dedicated to case-based exercises. The lecture portion of the course was not altered. Student attitudes were evaluated after each session and at the end of each semester via quantitative and qualitative survey questions. Student performance was evaluated using section exams and end-of-semester posttests. The vast majority of survey responses received were positive for both cased-based activities and traditional hands-on laboratories. In addition, participation in both types of active learning activities, but not lecture, was associated with retention of conceptual knowledge based on student performance between the section exams and posttests (P < 0.002). These results indicate that both case-based learning and laboratory exercises are beneficial learning activities to incorporate into a lecture-based physiology course. However, positive survey responses were significantly greater following case-based activities vs. traditional hands-on laboratories, and only participation in case-based activities resulted in greater student performance on the posttest (P < 0.04). Therefore, case-based activities may be the preferred supplemental learning activity for veterinary medical physiology.

AB In the country presently, preclinical medical students are not routinely exposed to real patients. Thus, when they start clinical postings, they are found to have poor clinical reasoning skills. Simulated virtual patients (SVPs) can improve clinical skills without endangering real patients. This pilot study describes the development of two SVPs in endocrine physiology and their validation in terms of acquisition of clinical knowledge and student engagement. Two SVPs, Nandini Sharma (unintentional weight gain) and Sunil Yadav (polyuria), were created and published on the i-Human Patients platform through an iterative, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary collaborative process using the conceptual framework of Kim et al. (Kim S, Phillips WR, Pinsky L, Brock D, Phillips K, Keary J. Med Educ 40: 867-876, 2006). After internal and external peer validation, the SVPs were piloted on 40 students (20 students per virtual patient) over 2 wk. A cognitive pretest was conducted before exposure, and a posttest soon after. Faculty and student feedback were collected. Faculty found SVPs authentic, helpful as teaching-learning tools, and useful for giving feedback and for assessment. Students found SVPs more engaging than paper cases and helpful in developing clinical reasoning and in imparting clinical exposure. Pretest and posttest scores indicated knowledge gain (P < 0.01). Although challenging to create, SVPs created on the i-Human Patients platform improved learning in endocrine physiology and were well accepted by students and faculty as a means to provide early clinical exposure. More SVPs can be developed through collaboration between stakeholder departments and integrated into the curriculum for greater benefit.

AB Formative assessments can enhance and enrich student learning. Typically, these have been used to provide feedback against end-of-course standards and prepare students for summative assessments of performance or measurement of competence. Here, we present the case for using assessments for learning to encompass a wider range of important outcomes. We discuss 1) the rationale for using assessment for learning; 2) guiding theories of expertise that inform assessment for learning; 3) theoretical and empirical evidence; 4) approaches to rigor and validation; and 5) approaches to implementation at multiple levels of the curriculum. The literature strongly supports the use of assessments as an opportunity to reinforce and enhance learning. Physiology teachers have a wide range of theories, models, and interventions from which to prepare students for retention, application, transfer, and future learning by using assessments.

AB The present study furthered the concept of simulation-based medical education by applying a personalized active learning component. We tested this novel approach utilizing a non-invasive hemodynamic monitor with the capability to measure and display in real time numerous hemodynamic parameters in the exercising participant. Changes in medical knowledge concerning physiology were examined with a pre- and posttest. Simply by observation of one's own hemodynamic variables, the understanding of complex physiological concepts was significantly enhanced.

AB The goal of this review is to highlight the key elements needed to successfully deploy team-based learning (TBL) in any class, but especially in large enrolment classes, where smooth logistics are essential. The text is based on a lecture and workshop given at the American Physiological Society's Institute on Teaching and Learning in Madison, WI, in June 2016. After a short overview of the TBL method, its underpinning in learning theory, and a summary of current evidence for its effectiveness, we present two case studies from our own teaching practices in a new medical school. The first case study explores critical elements of design and planning for a TBL module, and the second explores best practices in classroom management. As medical educators in the fields of physiology, pediatrics, nephrology, and family medicine, we present the objective views of subject matter experts who adopted TBL as one teaching method rather than TBL experts or advocates per se. The review is aimed primarily at faculty contemplating using TBL for the first time who are interested in exploring the significant benefits and challenges of TBL.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of using a puzzle to learn about cardiac physiology. Students were divided into control and game groups. In class 1, the control group had a 2-h theoretical class about cardiac physiology, including a detailed description of the phases of the cardiac cycle, whereas the game group had a 50-min theoretical class without the description of the cardiac cycle. In class 2, the control group did an assessment exercise before an activity with the cardiac puzzle and the game group answered questions after the above-mentioned activity. While solving the puzzle, the students had to describe the cardiac cycle by relating the concepts of heart morphology and physiology. To evaluate short-term learning, the number of wrong answers and grades in the assessment exercise were compared between the control and game groups. To evaluate mediumterm learning, we compared the grades obtained by students of the control and game groups in questions about cardiac physiology that formed part of the academic exam. In the assessment exercise, the game group presented a lower number of errors and higher score compared with the control group. In the academic exam, applied after both groups had used the puzzle, there was no difference in the scores obtained by the control and game groups in questions about cardiac physiology. These results showed a positive effect of the puzzle on students' learning about cardiac physiology compared with those not using the puzzle.

AB Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This eleventh installment of Explorations in Statistics explores statistical facets of reproducibility. If we obtain an experimental result that is scientifically meaningful and statistically unusual, we would like to know that our result reflects a general biological phenomenon that another researcher could reproduce if (s)he repeated our experiment. But more often than not, we may learn this researcher cannot replicate our result. The National Institutes of Health and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology have created training modules and outlined strategies to help improve the reproducibility of research. These particular approaches are necessary, but they are not sufficient. The principles of hypothesis testing and estimation are inherent to the notion of reproducibility in science. If we want to improve the reproducibility of our research, then we need to rethink how we apply fundamental concepts of statistics to our science.

AB Despite widespread calls for reform in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education, effecting lasting change in instructor practice is challenging to achieve. This article describes the results of a 2-yr research study that involved efforts to develop the pedagogical expertise of a group of anatomy and physiology instructors at the college level. Data were collected through a series of individual interviews that included the use of the Teacher Beliefs Inventory questionnaire (23) along with observations onsite in participants' college classrooms and at process-oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) curriculum writing workshops. Findings indicated attitudinal shifts on the part of participants from teacher-centered to more student-centered pedagogy and supported the benefits of long-term professional development for instructors. Here, we documented the successful progress of these professors as they participated in a curriculum development process that emphasized student-centered teaching with the goal of promoting broader change efforts in introductory anatomy and physiology.

AB While there are several tools to study learning styles of students, the visual-aural-read/write-kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire is a simple, freely available, easy to administer tool that encourages students to describe their behavior in a manner they can identify with and accept. The aim is to understand the preferred sensory modality (or modalities) of students for learning. Teachers can use this knowledge to facilitate student learning. Moreover, students themselves can use this knowledge to change their learning habits. Five hundred undergraduate students belonging to two consecutive batches in their second year of undergraduate medical training were invited to participate in the exercise. Consenting students (415 students, 83%) were administered a printed form of version 7.0 of the VARK questionnaire. Besides the questionnaire, we also collected demographic data, academic performance data (marks obtained in 10th and 12th grades and last university examination), and self-perceived learning style preferences. The majority of students in our study had multiple learning preferences (68.7%). The predominant sensory modality of learning was aural (45.5%) and kinesthetic (33.1%). The learning style preference was not influenced by either sex or previous academic performance. Although we use a combination of teaching methods, there has not been an active effort to determine whether these adequately address the different types of learners. We hope these data will help us better our course contents and make learning a more fruitful experience.

AB The freshman academic year is one of the most difficult years that a medical student experiences in his/her academic life at a medical school. Freshmen are frequently faced with several challenges, such as adaptation to a new academic environment and its associated different methods of teaching, learning, skills, and assessment. The aim of this study was to describe a 4-wk innovative summer premedical program developed by senior medical students at the College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, in an attempt to improve/smooth the experience(s) of prospective freshmen. This report describes the objectives/strategies/methodologies used to tackle the top three identified freshman challenges, namely, 1) advancement of the academic/scholastic/educational background, 2) the development of college-required skills to succeed and excel in the freshman year, and 3) adaption to the college environment. At the end of the program, a survey was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the summer premedical program. Seventy-two students attended this program over the past three summers from 2010 to 2012, and twenty-nine students answered the survey with a response rate of 74.7%. Overall, >90% of the survey respondents reported an improvement in their understanding of basic medical science, integration, presentation skills, medical terminology, and junior-senior relationships. Furthermore, the survey highlighted the need for more focus on skills such as time management, participation in large-group discussions, and use of electronic resources, as >50% of respondents reported no improvement in these areas. In conclusion, this is the first report, to our knowledge, that describes a program developed by senior medical students to improve the experience of freshmen.

AB Decades of behavioral observations have shown that invertebrate and vertebrate species have the ability to distinguish between self-generated afferent inputs versus those that are generated externally. In the present article, I describe activities focused around the discussion of a classic American Physiological Society paper by Curtis C. Bell that lays the foundation for students to investigate the neural substrate underlying this ability. Students will leave this activity being able to 1) describe the technical aspects and limitations of an electric fish preparation commonly used to acquire single unit (extracellular) neurophysiological data, 2) provide physiological evidence showing that the activity of principal cells in the posterior lateral line lobe of the electric fish brain reflects that of a reafference comparator that could be used in dissociating self-generated versus externally generated sensory signals, and 3) knowledgeably discuss hypotheses concerning the role of corollary discharge and cerebellar-like structures in vertebrate and invertebrate species. The skills and background knowledge gained in this activity lay the platform for advanced study of scientific investigations into sensory, motor, and cognitive processes in undergraduate, graduate, or medical school curricula.

AB This laboratory exercise demonstrates fundamental principles of mammalian locomotion. It provides opportunities to interrogate aspects of locomotion from biomechanics to energetics to body size scaling. It has the added benefit of having results with robust signal to noise so that students will have success even if not "meticulous" in attention to detail. First, using respirometry, students measure the energetic cost of hopping at a "preferred" hop frequency. This is followed by hopping at an imposed frequency half of the preferred. By measuring the O-2 uptake and work done with each hop, students calculate mechanical efficiency. Lessons learned from this laboratory include 1) that the metabolic cost per hop at half of the preferred frequency is nearly double the cost at the preferred frequency; 2) that when a person is forced to hop at half of their preferred frequency, the mechanical efficiency is nearly that predicted for muscle but is much higher at the preferred frequency; 3) that the preferred hop frequency is strongly body size dependent; and 4) that the hop frequency of a human is nearly identical to the galloping frequency predicted for a quadruped of our size. Together, these exercises demonstrate that humans store and recover elastic recoil potential energy when hopping but that energetic savings are highly frequency dependent. This stride frequency is dependent on body size such that frequency is likely chosen to maximize this function. Finally, by requiring students to make quantitative solutions using appropriate units and dimensions of the physical variables, these exercises sharpen analytic and quantitative skills.

AB Jin BE, Wulff H, Widdicombe JH, Zheng J, Bers DM, Puglisi JL. A simple device to illustrate the Einthoven triangle. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 319-324, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00029.2012.-The Einthoven triangle is central to the field of electrocardiography, but the concept of cardiac vectors is often a difficult notion for students to grasp. To illustrate this principle, we constructed a device that recreates the conditions of an ECG reading using a battery to simulate the electrical vector of the heart and three voltmeters for the main electrocardiographic leads. Requiring minimal construction with low cost, this device provides hands-on practice that enables students to rediscover the principles of the Einthoven triangle, namely, that the direction of the cardiac dipole can be predicted from the deflections in any two leads and that lead I + lead III + lead II independent of the position of heart's electrical vector. We built a total of 6 devices for classes of 30 students and tested them in the first-year Human Physiology course at the University of California-Davis School of Medicine. Combined with traditional demonstrations with ECG machines, this equipment demonstrated its ability to help medical students obtain a solid foundation of the basic principles of electrocardiography.

AB Scherl A, Dethleffsen K, Meyer M. Interactive knowledge networks for interdisciplinary course navigation within Moodle. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 284-297, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00086.2012.Web-based hypermedia learning environments are widely used in modern education and seem particularly well suited for interdisciplinary learning. Previous work has identified guidance through these complex environments as a crucial problem of their acceptance and efficiency. We reasoned that map-based navigation might provide straightforward and effortless orientation. To achieve this, we developed a clickable and user-oriented concept map-based navigation plugin. This tool is implemented as an extension of Moodle, a widely used learning management system. It visualizes inner and interdisciplinary relations between learning objects and is generated dynamically depending on user set parameters and interactions. This plugin leaves the choice of navigation type to the user and supports direct guidance. Previously developed and evaluated face-to-face interdisciplinary learning materials bridging physiology and physics courses of a medical curriculum were integrated as learning objects, the relations of which were defined by metadata. Learning objects included text pages, self-assessments, videos, animations, and simulations. In a field study, we analyzed the effects of this learning environment on physiology and physics knowledge as well as the transfer ability of third-term medical students. Data were generated from pre- and posttest questionnaires and from tracking student navigation. Use of the hypermedia environment resulted in a significant increase of knowledge and transfer capability. Furthermore, the efficiency of learning was enhanced. We conclude that hypermedia environments based on Moodle and enriched by concept map-based navigation tools can significantly support interdisciplinary learning. Implementation of adaptivity may further strengthen this approach.

Teaching cardiac electrophysiology modeling to undergraduate students: laboratory exercises and GPU programming for the study of arrhythmias and spiral wave dynamics. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 427-437, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00034.2011.-As part of a 3-wk intersession workshop funded by a National Science Foundation Expeditions in Computing award, 15 undergraduate students from the City University of New York1 collaborated on a study aimed at characterizing the voltage dynamics and arrhythmogenic behavior of cardiac cells for a broad range of physiologically relevant conditions using an in silico model. The primary goal of the workshop was to cultivate student interest in computational modeling and analysis of complex systems by introducing them through lectures and laboratory activities to current research in cardiac modeling and by engaging them in a hands-on research experience. The success of the workshop lay in the exposure of the students to active researchers and experts in their fields, the use of hands-on activities to communicate important concepts, active engagement of the students in research, and explanations of the significance of results as the students generated them. The workshop content addressed how spiral waves of electrical activity are initiated in the heart and how different parameter values affect the dynamics of these reentrant waves. Spiral waves are clinically associated with tachycardia, when the waves remain stable, and with fibrillation, when the waves exhibit breakup. All in silico experiments were conducted by simulating a mathematical model of cardiac cells on graphics processing units instead of the standard central processing units of desktop computers. This approach decreased the run time for each simulation to almost real time, thereby allowing the students to quickly analyze and characterize the simulated arrhythmias. Results from these simulations, as well as some of the background and methodology taught during the workshop, is presented in this article along with the programming code and the explanations of simulation results in an effort to allow other teachers and students to perform their own demonstrations, simulations, and studies.

AB Favero TG. Active review sessions can advance student learning. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 247-248, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00040.2011.-Traditional review sessions are intended to help students learn and prepare for upcoming exams. Most sessions are passive question and answer sessions that look backward at content deficits rather than advancing student learning. By incorporating active and cooperative learning approaches during a review session, students are able to recognize critical concepts and better prepare for physiological problem solving. Active review sessions help students prioritize the knowledge and develop the thinking skills will be required of them on the exam.

AB Brown S, Salter S. Analogies in science and science teaching. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 167-169, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00022.2010.-Analogies are often used in science, but students may not appreciate their significance, and so the analogies can be misunderstood or discounted. For this reason, educationalists often express concern about the use of analogies in teaching. Given the important place of analogies in the discourse of science, it is necessary that students are explicitly shown how they work, perhaps based on the structure-mapping theory we outline here. When using an analogy, the teacher should very clearly specify both its components and its limitations. Great care is required in developing an analogy to ensure that it is understood as intended and that misconceptions are minimized. This approach models the behavior of a scientist, which helps to develop student understanding of the practice of science.

AB The Physiology Core Concept of flow down gradients is a major concept in physiology, as pressure gradients are the key driving force for the bulk flow of fluids in biology. However, students struggle to understand that this principle is foundational to the mechanisms governing bulk flow across diverse physiological systems (e.g., blood flow, phloem sap flow). Our objective was to investigate whether bulk flow items that differ in scenario context (i.e., taxa, amount of scientific terminology, living or nonliving system) or in which aspect of the pressure gradient is kept constant (i.e., starting pressure or pressure gradient) influence under-graduate students' reasoning. Item scenario context did not impact the type of reasoning students used. However, students were more likely to use the Physiology Core Concept of "flow down [pressure] gradients" when the pressure gradient was kept constant and less likely to use this concept when the starting pressure was kept constant. We also investigated whether item scenario context or which aspect of the pressure gradient is kept constant impacted how consistent students were in the type of reasoning they used across two bulk flow items on the same homework. Most students were consistent across item scenario contexts (76%) and aspects of the pressure gradient kept constant (70%). Students who reasoned using "flow down gradients" on the first item were the most consistent (86, 89%), whereas students using "pressures indicate (but don't cause) flow" were the least consistent (43, 34%). Students who are less consistent know that pressure is somehow involved or indicates fluid flow but do not have a firm grasp of the concept of a pressure gradient as the driving force for fluid flow. These findings are the first empirical evidence to support the claim that using Physiology Core Concept reasoning supports transfer of knowledge across different physiological systems.NEW & NOTEWORTHY These findings are the first empirical evidence to support the claim that using Physiology Core Concept reasoning supports transfer of knowledge across different physiological systems.

AB The Mississippi IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (Grant P20GM103476) launched the new Mississippi INBRE Outreach Scholars (MIOS) summer research program in 2019. The program was designed to offer students community outreach and research experiences related to the study of behavioral and health disparities life sciences. The program was adapted in early 2020 to offer the program in a fully online format in the summer of 2020. This article details the program adaptations and discusses program evaluation data related to scholars' perceptions of program benefits and expectations and their confidence in research-related skills. The program evaluation was a mixed-method approach that included a qualitative postprogram survey and a pre-post quantitative survey. Scholars identified technical and communication skill building and resilience as areas of personal growth. Overall, the program met scholars' expectations for the program and significantly improved their confidence on 8 of the 19 (with confidence interval estimated differences from 0.3 to 2.56, where a difference of 1 is an improvement across 1 anchor on a Likert-type scale) various researchrelated tasks/skills after completion of the program. The analyses presented demonstrated that a combined qualitative and quantitative analysis approach is useful for examining the extent to which programs such as Mississippi INBRE are meeting goals of providing a rich research experience in health disparities for a diverse student body. Future longitudinal data may be examined to explore the long-term impact of MIOS on career preparation and choices and graduate education.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The Mississippi INBRE Outreach Scholars program is a summer research program for Mississippi college students that was successfully adapted to a fully online environment amidst the coronavirus-19 pandemic.

AB Flipped teaching (FT) is a student-centered instructional method that shifts lectures out of the classroom and uses a variety of activities to apply content during class time. FT has gained attention among educators as a student-centered instructional method. However, many faculty still lack the skills, knowledge, confidence, and expertise to implement FT in their classrooms. Therefore, course-specific training and focused mentorship are critical in successfully implementing FT. Four faculty members, from an adjunct professor to a full professor, from four diverse institutions around the country, were recruited and funded through the American Physiological Society's Teaching Career Enhancement Award to receive training in the implementation of FT in their courses. This study aimed to provide specific tools and strategies to engage students in deeper learning through activities in the participants' courses. A course was built using the Blackboard Learning Management System for the participants to receive relevant readings to be completed prior to the FT workshop. Upon completing this training, the participants examined the design and execution of FT in their classrooms and, subsequently, reflected on and refined their future course offerings. The facilitator mentored the participants throughout the process, including an on-site observation of a live FT session. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected before and after their FT experiences. Based on the survey results, this study helped improve the FT knowledge and self-efficacy of all participants. In conclusion, the faculty utilized the training and mentoring to implement FT in their classrooms successfully and disseminate their experiences and findings.

AB Idaho Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network for Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) aims to build biomedical research capacity and enhance the scientific and technology knowledge of the Idaho workforce. A key INBRE Program at The College of Idaho, a primarily undergraduate institution of 1,100 students, is a 10-wk summer fellows research experience. This report documents outcomes from 2005 to present, including demographic trends, faculty and student research productivity, selfreported gains, educational attainment, and career outcomes. Of 103 participants, 83.7% were from Idaho, 26.7% from rural areas, and 23.9% first-generation college students. Faculty and student research productivity (conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications) increased threefold. We found that 91.4% of fellows entered a scientific- or healthcare-related career and that 70.7% completed or are currently enrolled in postgraduate training (51.7% doctoral and 19.0% master's level). Anonymous surveys were uniformly positive, with gains in self-confidence and independent laboratory work. Open-ended responses indicated students valued mentoring efforts and improved awareness of scientific opportunities and competitive preparation for postgraduate training. Lastly, we observed that student research involvement increased college-wide during the award period. These data suggest that the summer fellows program is successfully meeting National Institutes of Health IDeA goals and serving as a pipeline to future health research careers and a scientifically trained Idaho workforce.

AB The current heightened social awareness and anxiety triggered by escalating violence against Black Americans in the United States demands a safe space for reflection, education, and civil discourse within the academic setting. Too often there is an unmet need paired with a collective urgent desire to better understand the chronic existing structural, social, educational, and health inequities affecting disadvantaged populations, particularly Black Americans. In this perspective, the authors provide insight into a shared learning approach that provided a forum to discuss Perspectives Against Racism (PAR). Unlike existing topdown approaches, faculty, trainees, and staff were engaged in leading a series of focused discussions to examine unconscious bias, promote awareness of implicit biases, and reflect on individual and collective roles and responsibilities in working toward becoming antiracist. An existing 1-h graduate elective seminar course was dedicated to creating a space for learning, discussion, and exchange of ideas related to the experience and existence of racism (personal and institutional/systemic). A goal of each session was to go beyond didactics and identify mechanisms to implement change, at the level of the individual, department, and institution. This perspective of the shared experience may provide an adaptable framework that can be implemented in an academic setting at the departmental, center, or institutional level.

AB Basic Concepts in Neurophysiology" was a 3-wk online course developed during six synchronous meetings combined with asynchronous activities. We proposed an active learning course that used free online platforms to teach physiology during a period in which undergraduates were not in classrooms or taking online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report the course organization and the students' involvement in, acceptance of, and evaluation of the course. To address the students' perceptions about these points, we sent a questionnaire to 49 participants who finished the course. We found that although most students (52.5%) had never taken a course with similar methods before, almost all of them (95%) liked the flipped class model. Additionally, a majority of the students (92.5%) said that the method increased their study frequency during the social distancing period, which is an important aspect to consider during this challenging time for both students and professors.

AB In higher education, it is a great challenge for instructors to teach international medical students (IMSs) efficiently. These students usually have different learning obstacles and learning style preferences from domestic students. Thus it is necessary to use teaching modalities targeting the specific characteristics of IMSs. Accordingly, we have developed a teaching modality composed of classical teacher-centered approach (TCA), enriched with components of student-centered approach (SCA) and online interactions targeting the learning characteristics of IMSs, which we defined as TESOT (an acronym made of the underlined words' initials). Aside from the online interactions that provide both answers to questions raised by students and guidance throughout a course, this modality contains additional in-classroom components (i.e., pre-lecture quiz, student-led summary, and post-lecture quiz). The effectiveness of this modality was tested in the nervous system module of the Physiology course for IMSs. The final exam scores in the nervous system module in the year taught with TESOT were higher than those earned by students taught with a classical TCA modality in preceding 2 yr. The improvement of teaching effectiveness is attributable to increasing communication, bridging course contexts, and meeting diverse learning style preferences. These results indicate that TESOT as an effective teaching modality is useful for enhancing efficiency of teaching IMSs.

The teacher demonstrated the practical from the medical school, and the students observed the procedure from the comfort of their own homes. Students were able to analyze the graphs captured in the teacher's laptop by remotely controlling the teacher's laptop. This method may be useful for places where face-to-face classes are suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Students from three undergraduate programs at James Cook University, Queensland, Australia, studying combined first-year anatomy and physiology courses, showed different academic achievement in physiology. Physiotherapy students were more active and social when completing learning tasks and achieved significantly higher grades in physiology compared with students enrolled in Sport and Exercise Science and Occupational Therapy programs. To promote academic engagement and achievement by all three groups, discussion questions, case studies, and study guides were included. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using these modified resources to promote active learning, enhance academic social interactions, and provide a supportive learning environment. The occupational therapy students showed increased academic achievement (from 57.9 to 66.5%) following implementation of the new resources, but there was no change in the already high-performing physiotherapy students (73.1%) and, more concerningly, the sport and exercise science students (from 54.6 to 56.7%). Fewer sport and exercise science students had prior learning in chemistry (30.4% of participants) and also spent little time outside class studying (8 h/wk). compared with the physiotherapy cohort (70.0% chemistry; 13 h/wk studying). Findings of this research demonstrate that creating a supportive and active learning environment are important factors in promoting the learning of physiology for some cohorts. Background knowledge, academic self-regulatory skills, and the experience of teaching staff are factors that must be considered when endeavoring to increase student academic achievement. Future studies should examine the effect of students' academic self-regulation and the use of remedial chemistry classes when learning physiology.

AB Twenty-eight undergraduate students in a health sciences program volunteered for an exercise in the history of examinations. They had completed a second-year course in anatomy and physiology in which they studied modern texts and took standard contemporary exams. For this historical "experiment," students studied selected chapters from two 19th century physiology texts (by Foster M. A Textbook of Physiology, 1895; and Broussais FJV. A Treatise on Physiology Applied to Pathology, 1828). They then took a 1-h-long exam in which they answered two essay-type questions set by Thomas Henry Huxley for second-year medical students at the University of London in 1853 and 1857. These were selected from a question bank provided by Dr. P. Mazumdar (University of Toronto). A questionnaire probed their contrasting experiences. Many wrote thoughtful, reflective comments on the exercise, which not only gave them an insight into the difficulties faced by students in the past, but also proved to be a valuable learning experience (average score: 8.6 +/- 1.6 SD).

TI What makes skeletal muscle striated? Discoveries in the endosarcomeric
   and exosarcomeric cytoskeleton

AB One of the most iconic images in biology is the cross-striated appearance of a skeletal muscle fiber. The repeating baud pattern shows that all of the sarcomeres are the same length. All of the A hands are the same length and are located in the middle of the sarcomeres. Furthermore, all of the myofibrils are transversely aligned across the muscle fiber. It has been known for 300 yr that skeletal muscle is striated, but only in the last 40 yr has a molecular understanding of the striations emerged. In the 1950s it was discovered that the extraction of myosin from myofibrils abolished the A bands, and the myofibrils were no longer striated. With the further extraction of actin, only the Z disks remained. Strangely, the sarcomere length did not change, and these "ghost" myofibrils still exhibited elastic behavior. The breakthrough came in the 1970s with the discovery of the gigantic protein titin. Titin, an elastic protein similar to 1 mu m in length, runs from the Z disk to the middle of the A hand and ensures that each sarcomere is the same length. Titin anchors the A band in the middle of the sarcomere and may determine thick-filament length and thus A-band length. In the 1970s it was proposed that the intermediate filament desmin, which surrounds the Z disks, connects adjacent myofibrils, resulting in the striated appearance of a skeletal muscle fiber.

AB The primary aim of this study was to determine whether levels of student engagement, higher order skill proficiency, and knowledge acquisition demonstrated by medical students would differ when completing the same course in three diverse learning environments. Following Institutional Review Board approval, 56 first-year medical students, registered at the same medical school but attending class at three different campus centers, were enrolled in the study. All participants were completing a medical physiology course that utilized the same learning objectives but relied on different faculty incorporating diverse methodologies (percentage of class devoted to active learning strategies), course format (6-wk block vs. 17-wk semester), and student attendance. Students completed a validated survey of student engagement (SSE), a proctored online problem-based assessment of higher order skill proficiency [Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+); http://cae.org], and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Physiology subject exam. In this limited sample, results indicate no significant differences between campus sites for any of the variables assessed. Levels of engagement were lower than expected compared with published values for graduate students. Higher order skill proficiency assessed by CLA was significantly higher than values reported for college seniors nationally. Surprisingly, SSE offered no prediction of performance on CLA + or NBME, as there were no significant correlations between variables. These data indicate that, although first-year medical students may not perceive themselves as highly engaged, they are adept in using higher order skills and excel in meeting course learning objectives, regardless of learning environment.

DE INBRE; primarily undergraduate institution; student experience;

AB The Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program, housed within the National Institute for General Medical Sciences, administers the Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) as a strategic mission to broaden the geographic distribution of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding within the United States. Undergraduate summer student mentored research programs (SSMRP) are a common feature of INBRE programs and are designed to increase undergraduate student interest in research careers in the biomedical sciences. Little information is available about student perspectives on how these programs impact their choices relative to education and careers. Therefore, we conducted qualitative interviews with 20 participants from the Arkansas INBRE SSMRP in the years 2002-2012. Each telephone interview lasted 30-45 min. An interview guide with a broad "grand tour" question was used to elicit student perspectives on SSMRP participation. Interviews were digitally recorded, then transcribed verbatim, and the transcript checked for accuracy. Content analysis and constant comparison were used to identify nine themes that were grouped into three temporal categories: before, during, and after the SSMRP experience. Students viewed the experience as positive and felt it impacted their career choices. They emphasized the value of mentoring in the program, and some reported maintaining a relationship with the mentor after the summer experience ended. Students also valued learning new laboratory and presentation skills and felt their research experience was enhanced by meeting students and scientists with a wide range of career interests. These data suggest that the Arkansas INBRE and the NIH IDeA program are successfully meeting the goal of increasing interest in research among undergraduates.

DE biomedical research; impact; symposium; undergraduate
AB The Kansas-IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (K-INBRE) is an infrastructure-building program funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Undergraduate education, through undergraduate research, is a key component of the program. The K-INBRE network includes 10 higher education institutions in Kansas and northern Oklahoma, with over 1,000 student participants in 16 yr. Since 2003, the K-INBRE has held an annual state-wide research symposium that includes national and regional speakers and provides a forum for undergraduates to give platform and poster presentations. The symposium is well attended by K-INBRE participants and has grown to a size of over 300 participants per year from all 10 K-INBRE schools. Two surveys were distributed to students and mentors to assess the impact of the symposium on student learning. Surveys (153) were distributed to students who participated in K-INBRE from 2013 through 2015 with a 51% response rate. Mentors were surveyed with a response of 111 surveys out of 161. Survey results indicate that students and mentors alike find the symposium to be beneficial and enriching of the student experience. Almost 80% of student respondents indicated that their participation in the symposium fostered appreciation of research. In short, the K-INBRE symposium provides a unique opportunity for students to gain experience in collecting, preparing, and communicating research in a professional environment. The collaborative experience of the annual K-INBRE symposium, the impact it has on student learning, and how it has influenced the research culture at our 10 institutions will be described.

AB The aim of this review is to highlight recent and potential future enhancements to the United States Licensing Examination (USMLE) program. The USMLE program is co-owned by the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards. The USMLE includes four examinations: Step 1, Step 2 Clinical Knowledge, Step 2 Clinical Skills, and Step 3; every graduate of Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited allopathic medical schools and all international medical graduates must pass this examination series to practice medicine in the United States. From 2006 to 2009, the program underwent an indepth review resulting in five accepted recommendations. These recommendations have been the primary driver for many of the recent enhancements, such as an increased emphasis on foundational science and changes in the clinical skills examination, including more advanced communication skills assessment. These recommendations will continue to inform future changes such as access to references (e.g., a map of metabolic pathways) or decision-making tools for use during the examination. The NBME also provides assessment services globally to medical schools, students, residency programs, and residents. In 2015, > 550,000 assessments were provided through the subject examination program, NBME self-assessment services, and customized assessment services.

AB Exercise training has proven to be beneficial in the prevention of disease. In addition, exercise can improve the pathogenesis and symptoms associated with a variety of chronic disease states and can attenuate drug-induced adverse effects. Exercise is a drug-free polypill. Because the benefits of exercise are clear and profound, Exercise is Medicine, a joint initiative between the American Medical Association and American College of Sports Medicine, was launched in 2007 to call on all health care providers to counsel patients and prescribe exercise in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease states. Pharmacists play an increasing role in direct patient care and are the most accessible health care providers in the community. Thus, pharmacists should be knowledgeable in counseling patients on the frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise that is appropriate for various conditions and disease states. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of didactic course offerings in United States pharmacy school curricula regarding training in exercise prescription. School websites were accessed for information regarding course offerings in PharmD programs. No United States pharmacy schools offered courses that were dedicted to the role of exercise in disease prevention or exercise prescription in disease management. Ninety percent of pharmacy schools did not offer courses with the keywords "exercise," "fitness, or "physical activity" in the title or description. The data suggest that student pharmacists are not adequately trained to counsel patients on the benefits of exercise or exercise prescription.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate particular psychosocial predictors of obesity bias in prehealth professionals, which include the internalization of athletic and general body ideals, perceived media pressure and information, and achievement goal orientations. Exercise science undergraduate students (n = 242) filled out a survey containing questions of demographic characteristics, achievement goals, social-cultural attitudes toward appearance (using Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-3), and obesity bias measurements (using the antifat attitudes test and fat phobia scale). The results indicated that students were explicitly biased toward overweight and obese individuals, held had high task and ego goals, and had high internalization of an athletic body type ideal, as determined by mean scores being above the median values for each scale. Internalization of the athletic body type predicted obesity bias for fat phobia, weight control blame, and physical/romantic attractiveness. In conclusion, exercise science students may enter programs socialized from society and sport, and, potentially, these psychosocial attitudes and beliefs may have implications to working with future clients, especially for those of the general population and those whose body shape and size are different than themselves.

AB In response to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Association of American Medical Colleges Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians (SFFP) report and a concern for better preparing undergraduates for future doctoral programs in the health professions, the deans of the College of Arts and Sciences and Division of Basic Biomedical Sciences of Sanford School of Medicine of the University of South Dakota formed an ad hoc Premedical Curriculum Review Committee with representatives from the science departments and medical school. The Committee began by reviewing the university's suggested premedical curriculum and matching it to the proposed competencies from the SFFP to document duplications and deficiencies. The proposed changes in the Medical College Admission Test for 2015 were also evaluated. The Committee proposed a stronger premedical curriculum, with the development of some new courses, including an inquiry-based physiology course with team-based learning, to more fully address SFFP competencies. These analyses convinced the university that a new major would best help students achieve the competencies and prepare them for admission exams. Thus, a new Medical Biology major was proposed to the South Dakota Board of Regents and accepted for its initial offering in 2012. The new major has been broadly advertised to future students and is successful as a recruiting tool for the university. This article details the process of evaluating the curriculum and designing the new major, describes some of the difficulties in its implementation, and reviews outcomes from the new major to date.

AB The aim of the present study was to critically evaluate the accuracy and readability of English Wikipedia articles on the respiratory system and its disorders and whether they can be a suitable resource for medical students. On April 27, 2014, English Wikipedia was searched for articles on respiratory topics. Using a modified DISCERN instrument, articles were independently scored by three assessors. The scoring targeted content accuracy, frequency of updating, and quality of references. The readability of articles was measured using two other instruments. The mean DISCERN score for the 40 articles identified was 26.4 +/- 6.3. Most articles covered causes, signs and symptoms, prevention, and treatment. However, several knowledge deficiencies in the pathogenesis of diseases, investigations needed, and treatment were observed. The total number of references for the 40 articles was 1,654, and the references varied from 0 to 168 references, but several problems were identified in the list of references and citations made. The readability of articles was in the range of 9.4 +/- 1.8 to 22.6 +/- 10.7 using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level instrument and 10.0 +/- 2.6 to 19.6 +/- 8.3 using the Readability Coleman-Liau index. A strong correlation was found between the two instruments (r(2) = 0.744, P < 0.001). The agreement between the assessors had mean kappa scores in the range of 0.712-0.857. In conclusion, despite the effort placed in creating Wikipedia respiratory articles by anonymous volunteers (wikipedians), most articles had knowledge deficiencies, were not accurate, and were not suitable for medical students as learning resources.

AB Students are naturally curious and inquisitive with powerful intrinsic motives to probe, learn, and understand their world. Accordingly, class activities must capitalize on this inherently energetic and curious nature so that learning becomes a lifelong activity where students take initiative for learning, are skilled in learning, and want to learn new things. This report describes a student-centered class activity, the "flipped exam," designed to achieve this goal. The flipped exam was a collaborative, group effort, and learning was interactive. It included a significant proportion (similar to 30-35%) of material not covered in class. This required students to actively search for content and context, dynamically making connections between what they knew and what they learned, grappling with complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, and finally discovering answers to important questions. Accordingly, the need or desire to know was the catalyst for meaningful learning. Student assessment was determined by behavioral noncognitive parameters that were based on the observation of the student and the student's work as well as cognitive parameters (i.e., the student's score on the examination). It is our view that the flipped exam provided a student-centered activity in which students discovered, because of the need to know and opportunities for discussion, the important concepts and principles we wanted them to learn.

DE neuromuscular control; nerve properties; reflexes
AB The measurement and representation of the electrical activity of muscles [electromyography (EMG)] have a long history from the Victorian Era until today. Currently, EMG has uses both as a research tool, in noninvasively recording muscle activation, and clinically in the diagnosis and assessment of nerve and muscle disease and injury as well as in assessing the recovery of neuromuscular function after nerve damage. In the present report, we describe the use of a basic EMG setup in our teaching laboratories to demonstrate some of these current applications. Our practical also illustrates some fundamental physiological and structural properties of nerves and muscles. Learning activities include 1) displaying the recruitment of muscle fibers with increasing force development; 2) the measurement of conduction velocity of motor nerves; 3) the assessment of reflex delay and demonstration of Jendrassik's maneuver; and 4) a Hoffman reflex experiment that illustrates the composition of mixed nerves and the differential excitability thresholds of fibers within the same nerve, thus aiding an understanding of the reflex nature of muscle control. We can set up the classes at various levels of inquiry depending on the needs/professional requirements of the class. The results can then provide an ideal platform for a discovery learning session/tutorial on how the central nervous system controls muscles, giving insights on how supraspinal control interacts with reflexes to give smooth, precise muscular activation.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the contents of medical textbooks, eMedicine (Medscape) topics, and YouTube videos on cardiovascular mechanisms. Medical textbooks, eMedicine articles, and YouTube were searched for cardiovascular mechanisms. Using appraisal forms, copies of these resources and videos were evaluated independently by three assessors. Most textbooks were brief in explaining mechanisms. Although the overall average percentage committed to cardiovascular mechanisms in physiology textbooks (n = 7) was 16.1% and pathology textbooks (n = 4) was 17.5%, there was less emphasis on mechanisms in most internal medicine textbooks (n = 6), with a total average of 6.9%. In addition, flow diagrams explaining mechanisms were lacking. However, eMedicine topics (n = 48) discussed mechanisms adequately in 22.9% (11 of 48) topics, and the percentage of content allocated to cardiovascular mechanisms was higher (15.8%, 46.2 of 292) compared with that of any internal medicine textbooks. Only 29 YouTube videos fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 YouTube were educationally useful, scoring 14.1 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SD). The remaining 13 videos were not educationally useful, scoring 6.1 +/- 1.7. The concordance between the assessors on applying the criteria measured by kappa score was in the range of 0.55-0.96. In conclusion, despite the importance of mechanisms, most textbooks and YouTube videos were deficient in cardiovascular mechanisms. eMedicine topics discussed cardiovascular mechanisms for some diseases, but there were no flow diagrams or multimedia explaining mechanisms. These deficiencies in learning resources could add to the challenges faced by students in understanding cardiovascular mechanisms.

AB Harris DM, Ryan K, Rabuck C. Using a high-fidelity patient simulator with first-year medical students to facilitate learning of cardiovascular function curves. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 213-219, 2012; doi: 10.1152/advan.00058.2012.-Students are relying on technology for learning more than ever, and educators need to adapt to facilitate student learning. High-fidelity patient simulators (HFPS) are usually reserved for the clinical years of medical education and are geared to improve clinical decision skills, teamwork, and patient safety. Finding ways to incorporate HFPS into preclinical medical education represents more of a challenge, and there is limited literature regarding its implementation. The main objective of this study was to implement a HFPS activity into a problem-based curriculum to enhance the learning of basic sciences. More specifically, the focus was to aid in student learning of cardiovascular function curves and help students develop heart failure treatment strategies based on basic cardiovascular physiology concepts. Pretests and posttests, along with student surveys, were used to determine student knowledge and perception of learning in two first-year medical school classes. There was an increase of 21% and 22% in the percentage of students achieving correct answers on a posttest compared with their pretest score. The median number of correct questions increased from pretest scores of 2 and 2.5 to posttest scores of 4 and 5 of a possible total of 6 in each respective year. Student survey data showed agreement that the activity aided in learning. This study suggests that a HFPS activity can be implemented during the preclinical years of medical education to address basic science concepts. Additionally, it suggests that student learning of cardiovascular function curves and heart failure strategies are facilitated.

AB West JB. Internet-based course on pulmonary pathophysiology. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 1-2, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00125.2011.-A course of seven video lectures on pulmonary pathophysiology has been placed on the internet. This is a companion to the course on respiratory physiology available at http://meded.ucsd.edu/ifp/jwest/. That course dealt with normal respiratory physiology, and the new lectures are about the function of the diseased lung. The topics covered include pulmonary function tests, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and localized airway obstruction, restrictive lung diseases, pulmonary vascular diseases, environmental or industrial lung diseases ( with a short section on neoplastic and infectious diseases), and respiratory failure. Although it could be argued that PhD physiologists do not have a responsibility for teaching pathophysiology, collaborative teaching has become increasingly common in medical schools where, for example, a pulmonary block includes both normal respiratory physiology and some pulmonary pathophysiology. It is hoped that these lectures will be useful to physiologists in that setting.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 206-212, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00067.2010.-Cross-disciplinary (CD) learning experiences benefit student understanding of concepts and curriculum by offering opportunities to explore topics from the perspectives of alternate fields of study. This report involves a qualitative evaluation of CD health sciences undergraduate laboratory experiences in which concepts and students from two distinct disciplines [chemistry (CHEM) and exercise physiology (EPHE)] combined to study exercise thermoregulation and sweat analysis. Twenty-eight senior BSc Kinesiology (EPHE) students and 42 senior BSc CHEM students participated as part of their mutually exclusive, respective courses. The effectiveness of this laboratory environment was evaluated qualitatively using written comments collected from all students as well as from formal focus groups conducted after the CD laboratory with a representative cohort from each class (n = 16 CHEM students and 9 EPHE students). An open coding strategy was used to analyze the data from written feedback and focus group transcripts. Coding topics were generated and used to develop five themes found to be consistent for both groups of students. These themes reflected the common student perceptions that the CD experience was valuable and that students enjoyed being able to apply academic concepts to practical situations as well as the opportunity to interact with students from another discipline of study. However, students also reported some challenges throughout this experience that stemmed from the combination of laboratory groups from different disciplines with limited modification to the design of the original, pre-CD, learning environments. The results indicate that this laboratory created an effective learning opportunity that fostered student interest and enthusiasm for learning. The findings also provide information that could inform subsequent design and implementation of similar CD experiences to enhance engagement of all students and improve instructor efficacy.

AB Prakash ES. Explicit constructivism: a missing link in ineffective lectures? Adv Physiol Educ 34: 93-96, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00025.2010.-This study tested the possibility that interactive lectures explicitly based on activating learners' prior knowledge and driven by a series of logical questions might enhance the effectiveness of lectures. A class of 54 students doing the respiratory system course in the second year of the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program in my university was randomized to two groups to receive one of two types of lectures, "typical" lectures (n = 28, 18 women and 10 men) or "constructivist" lectures (n = 26, 19 women and 7 men), on the same topic: the regulation of respiration. Student pretest scores in the two groups were comparable (P > 0.1). Students that received the constructivist lectures did much better in the posttest conducted immediately after the lectures (6.8 +/- 3.4 for constructivist lectures vs. 4.2 +/- 2.3 for typical lectures, means +/- SD, P = 0.004). Although both types of lectures were well received, students that received the constructivist lectures appeared to have been more satisfied with their learning experience. However, on a posttest conducted 4 mo later, scores obtained by students in the two groups were not any different (6.9 +/- 3 for constructivist lectures vs. 6.9 +/- 3.7 for typical lectures, P = 0.94). This study adds to the increasing body of evidence that there is a case for the use of interactive lectures that make the construction of knowledge and understanding explicit, easy, and enjoyable to learners.

AB Sarikaya O, Kalaca S, Yeg. en BC,, Cali S. The impact of a faculty development program: evaluation based on the self-assessment of medical educators from preclinical and clinical disciplines. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 35-40, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00024.2010.-Self-assessment tools have previously been used to assess the impact of a faculty development program on the teaching skills of medical educators. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of a faculty development program on the teaching performances of faculty members in relation to their medical disciplines and academic positions. A faculty-training program consisted of "training skills" and "student assessment instruments" courses. The impact of the program was evaluated by self-reporting of faculty members (a total of 225 reports) 1-2 yr after the program. Both courses were found to be beneficial by nearly all of the attendants. Clinicians benefited more from some topics in the student assessment course and could apply the structured learning and assessment guides, structured oral examination, and objective structured clinical examination more efficiently than their peers from preclinical departments. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the participants of the faculty development program modified their teaching activities according to the demands of their clinical practice. The correlations between the benefits and behavioral changes were statistically significant.

Adv Physiol Educ 34: 59-64, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00004.2010.-The introduction of case studies on the autonomic nervous system in a fourth-semester physiology course unit for Pharmacy students is described in this article. This article considers how these case studies were developed and presents their content. Moreover, it reflects on their implementation and, finally, the reception of such a transformation among the students as well as the tutor's perception. Specifically, the following issues were addressed. First, how were the course unit and, within the course unit, case study components organized? Second, how was the transformation of the course unit from an originally interactive but rather teacher-centered lecture to an interactive course module achieved? Third, how were the case studies structured, what questions were asked, and what were the answers expected from the students; what additional information was provided by the tutor? Fourth, how did the implementation of these case studies work out in the actual course, i.e., how did the tutor guide the students in this interactive session and how did the students tackle the problems? Finally, how was the integration of interactive modules received by the students and what was their learning experience (as assessed by questionnaires) and learning success (as assessed through the final course exam)? Equally, the tutor's perception of this transformation and its implementation is described.

AB Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is a promising educational framework that is understudied in graduate medical education. To determine participant satisfaction and engagement with phases of an IBL postgraduate education program, a mixed-methods study collected data via survey statements and open-ended responses. The authors included participants attending an intensive care medicine (ICM) IBL program from May to November 2020. Quantitative outcomes included participants' satisfaction with the IBL format and impact of engagement with IBL on the learning experience. Qualitative outcomes explored determinants of engagement with IBL phases and the impact on the learning experience. Of 378 attendees, 167 submitted survey responses (44.2%). There was strong agreement relating to overall satisfaction (93.4%). Responses indicated engagement with "orientation" (94.6%), "conceptualization" (97.3%), "discussion" (91.1%), and "conclusion" (91.0%) but limited engagement with the "investigation" phase (48.1%). Greater engagement with IBL phases had positive impacts, with repeat attenders having clearer learning objectives (79.1% vs. 56.6%, P < 0.05) and enhanced learning through collaborative discussion (65.9% vs. 48.7%, P < 0.05). Qualitative analysis showed that ICM learners value active learning principles, clear objectives, and a safe environment to expand their "knowledge base." Sessions facilitated "clinically relevant learning," with application of theoretical knowledge. Learners transformed and "reframed their understanding," using the input of others' experiences. ICM learners were highly satisfied with the IBL format and reported valuable learning. Participants engaged strongly with all IBL phases except the investigation phase during the sessions. IBL facilitated learners' active construction of meaning, facilitating a constructivist approach to learning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY An inquiry-based learning (IBL) program was launched as part of a novel binational intensive care medicine education program. Postgraduate intensive care medicine practitioners participated in this education intervention, where facilitated group discussions explored core intensive care medicine concepts. Survey responses indicated overall satisfaction, engagement with the IBL format, and a constructivist approach to learning. This study provided new insights into the benefits and challenges of an IBL program in the context of practicing clinicians.

AB Problem-based learning encourages students to deepen their understanding of a concept by working through a real-world example of course content. Case studies represent a form of problem-based learning that engages students in realistic scenarios to achieve a deeper understanding of concepts. Case studies have been shown to facilitate the learning of challenging subject matter. We hypothesized that the use of a case study would help students better learn the topic of genomic imprinting, an abstract phenomenon in molecular biology and genetics. We wrote an interrupted case study that focused on genomic imprint- ing. The case study consists of three short popular news articles that relate to genomic imprinting. Each article is followed by a set of two to four questions. Students read each article and discuss its associated questions in small groups and then with the entire class before moving on to the next article. We deployed the case study in an intermediate-level molecular biology course at a small, liberal arts university. We assessed student learning and attitudes toward the case study (50 pre/postmatched pairs). In four true/false assessment questions, our results showed that the students' performance on the assessment after the case study was significantly higher than their performance before the case study. Students also self-reported increased knowledge of concepts related to genomic imprinting. Finally, students were likely to agree that the case study was beneficial to their learning and was an enjoyable classroom activity. We conclude that the case study is an effective way to instruct students about the topic of genomic imprinting.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Students often struggle with the concept of genomic imprinting, in part because it violates Mendelian rules of inheritance. Students learned about genomic imprinting, and enjoyed doing it when completing this case study.

AB Increasingly, basic science educators at medical and health science programs are faced with the challenge of delivering fundamental science content using evidence-based pedagogical approaches that build students' fund of knowledge while also supporting their development as self-regulated learners. This has led to an increased use of active learning-based pedagogies such as flipped classroom teaching. However, there are many open questions about the conditions necessary for successful flipped classroom sessions. In particular, the role of student compliance (i.e., participation, engagement, attendance) in mediating performance needs to be evaluated. This is especially important in accelerated curricula where multiple basic science disciplines are integrated together in pass-fail courses, presenting challenges to both students' time and cognitive load. Data on prematriculation performance, in-class participation, weekly quiz performance, and summative assessment performance from three cohorts of medical students (n = 146) at a new medical school were collected and analyzed. We found that historically high-performing students more readily participated in flipped classroom application sessions compared with historically lower-performing students. Correlational analysis of performance on weekly formative quizzes and the summative course exam was not related to in-class participation. However, performance on weekly formative quizzes played the most significant role in students' performance on summative exams. Efforts to understand the benefits of inclass participation beyond short-term assessment performance, such as long-term knowledge retention or development of noncognitive skills, should be undertaken to justify using such time- and human resource-intensive pedagogies.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study explores the use of flipped classroom teaching in a voluntary and accelerated medical school course. We found that historically high-performing students attend class, whereas historically low-performing students do not attend class as readily. Formative assessment performance appears to be more important than participation in determining the final grade. Correlation of high performance (>90%) with participation may differentiate students who excel in our curriculum from those who simply pass with superficial knowledge.

AB Bioethics is an important aspect of understanding the relationship between science and society, but studies have not yet examined undergraduate student experiences and comfort in bioethics courses. In this study, we investigated undergraduate bioethics students' support of and comfort when learning three controversial bioethics topics: gene editing, abortion, and physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Furthermore, student identity has been shown to influence how students perceive and learn about controversial topics at the intersection of science and society. So, we explored how students' religious affiliation, gender, or political affiliation was associated with their support of and comfort when learning about gene editing, abortion, and PAS. We found that most students entered bioethics with moderated viewpoints on controversial topics but that there were differences in students' tendency to support each topic based on their gender, religion, and political affiliation. We also saw differences in student comfort levels based on identity: women reported lower comfort than men when learning about gene editing, religious students were less comfortable than nonreligious students when learning about abortion and PAS, and nonliberal students were less comfortable than liberal students when learning about abortion. Students cited that the controversy surrounding these topics and a personal hesitancy to discuss them caused discomfort. These findings indicate that identity impacts comfort and support in a way similar to that previously shown in the public. Thus, it may be important for instructors to consider student identity when teaching bioethics topics to maximize student comfort, ultimately encouraging thoughtful consideration and engagement with these topics.

AB The teaching-learning process must constantly overcome the barriers imposed by rapid scientific and technological advances, as well as changes in the profiles of students and access to information. This study intended to analyze the perceptions of students and professors of medical courses of the teaching-learning strategies used in physiology at different Brazilian universities as well as the factors that influence or hinder the learning of this discipline. Questionnaires were analyzed from 174 students and 16 professors of physiology from medical courses of 20 higher education institutions (public and private) in a southern Brazilian state. The teaching strategies most used by physiology teachers coincided with the classroom activities that students consider to have the greatest contribution to their learning (expository classes/lectures, tests and questionnaires, problem-based learning/ clinical case studies, and demonstrative/practical classes). It was also evidenced that teachers' didactic is considered as a very influencing factor for the students during their learning process, whereas the teachers pointed out daily pedagogical practice as the most relevant factor in the development of their skills within the classroom. In addition, some factors hindering the teaching-learning process of physiology were identified by the respondents, such as large amounts of information, little time for study outside the classroom, previous knowledge, and intrinsic difficulty of the discipline. Finally, students tended to study alone and generally used teachers' slides and their own notes as study materials. The continuous assessment of the perceptions, needs, and difficulties of students and teachers plays an essential role in improving the teaching-learning process.

TI Anatomical self-efficacy of undergraduate students improves during a
   fully online biology course with at-home dissections

AB Student enrollments in online college courses have grown steadily over the past decade, and college administrators expect this trend to continue or accelerate. Despite the growing popularity of online education, one major critique in the sciences is that students are not trained in the hands-on skills they may need for the workforce, graduate school, or professional school. For example, the Association of American Medical Colleges has recommended that medical schools evaluate applicants on their motor skills and observation skills, yet many online biology programs do not offer opportunities for students to develop these skills. In on-campus biology programs, students commonly develop these skills through hands-on animal dissections, but educators have struggled with how to teach dissections in an online environment. We designed a fully online undergraduate biology course that includes at-home, hands-on dissections of eight vertebrate specimens. Over three course offerings, we evaluated changes in four student outcomes: anatomical self-efficacy, confidence in laboratory skills, perceptions of support, and concerns about dissections. Here, we describe how we implemented at-home dissections in the online course and show that students taking the course gained anatomical self-efficacy and confidence in multiple laboratory skills. Based on open-ended responses, the students perceived that their experiences with the at-home dissections facilitated these gains. These results demonstrate that athome, hands-on laboratories are a viable approach for teaching practical skills to students in fully online courses. We encourage science instructors to introduce at-home laboratories into their online courses, and we provide recommendations for instructors interested in implementing at-home laboratories.

AB To evaluate the efficacy of an educational module on evidence-based medicine (EBM) assisted with electronic medical databases (EMDs) for preclinical education, medical students (n = 111) were matriculated in a program consisted of 16 2-h sessions on EBM plus hands-on experience on EMDs in a problem-based learning-type format. Students were required to make an oral presentation on designated clinical scenarios before and after the sessions, without prior notice, as an indicator of performance. In addition, questionnaires focusing on behavioral changes, awareness, and confidence of mastering EBM were administered before and after the sessions to assess the attitudinal and behavioral impact of the intervention on the participants. We found evidence of better postprogram performance in utilizing EBM-relevant concepts and resources when the enrolled medical students were giving oral presentations. Moreover, the participants reported increased awareness of EBM and, behaviorally, increased utilization of EBM-relevant resources provided by libraries. Also, they reported improvement on appropriately using EBM-relevant resources, and 99% of the participants reported strong confidence in practicing EBM. In conclusion, modules on EBM implemented with EMDs benefitted medical students in scenario-oriented PBL tutorials. Improvements in awareness, behavior, confidence, and performance in mastering EBM were noted.

AB Preventing impairments in athletic performance is an important concept for students that are preparing for careers that involve working with athletes. Gaining hands on, laboratory-based experience in measuring exercise induced dehydration can help students understand how to help athletes prevent dehydration induced impairment in performance. This article describes a laboratory exercise for junior and senior students in a sports nutrition class, in which the students measure changes in body mass (as a measure of dehydration) due to 40 min of moderate-intensity exercise and 40 min of vigorous-intensity exercise. The students also measure how much water is in a mouthful from a sports bottle and from a drinking fountain. The students then calculate how many mouthfuls are necessary to replace exercise induced fluid losses. This laboratory exercise has been well received by students and has improved performance on the test regarding hydration.

AB Assessment methods vary widely across undergraduate physiology courses. Here, a cumulative oral examination was administered in two sections of a 300-level undergraduate physiology course. Student performance was quantified via instructor grading using a rubric, and self-perceptions (n = 55) were collected via survey. Overall, students affirmed that the oral examination assisted in their learning, specifically by leading them to begin preparation for their final written exam earlier than they otherwise would. The instructor considered the oral exam useful for student learning by providing a scaffold to the written final exam and a way to connect with students before a high-stakes final exam. Specific details of the examination format and suggestions and considerations for those considering this assessment approach are provided.

AB It is unclear if the transition from traditional, in-person physiology laboratories to virtual alternatives has educational impacts on students. This study used a systematic review to critically evaluate research papers that investigated the effectiveness of virtual physiology laboratories for student learning. Eleven studies, retrieved from the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Ovid MEDLINE databases, were selected for inclusion in this review, based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Subsequently, the studies went through a power analysis for potential biases before their results were synthesized and analyzed. This systematic review found that virtual physiology laboratories are effective for students' learning of concepts. However, it was inconclusive as to whether virtual physiology laboratories are effective for students' motivation for learning and learning of technical skills. It was found that blended models of virtual laboratories are at least as effective as in-person laboratories for conceptual learning. Overall, this systematic review provides useful insights for educators regarding the educational impacts of implementing virtual laboratories into the physiology curriculum and suggests research models for future evaluation of virtual laboratories.

ID AUTOPSY; ORIGIN
AB Giovanni Maria Lancisi (1654-1720) was one of the most important Italian physicians of the modern age. Orphaned of his mother, he spent his early years in the city of Orvieto; when he was 12, his father brought him back to Rome and enrolled him to study medicine at the Sapienza University in Rome. His dedication to study and work soon led him to increasingly important positions. Within a few years, the fame of Lancisi became such that he was appointed the personal physician of three popes. In De Subitaneis Mortibus (1707), he described the pathophysiology of heart diseases, identifying the cause of sudden deaths in structural anomalies of the heart, lungs, and brain. He also wrote about cerebral localizations and first discussed the physiological mechanisms of urine formation and excretion. In 1717, Lancisi described the pathogenesis of malaria and the close correlation between its onset and the swampy waters of the Tiber River, proposing the draining of marshes to eradicate malaria. In the posthumous De Motu Cordis et Aneurysmatibus (1728) he described for the first time heart dilatation and aneurysms of the great vessels, providing a fundamental contribution to the history of cardiovascular physiology. Proof of his interest in medical education is the establishment of an academy and the donation of a library to the hospital, bridging the gap between theory and practice in medical training. Over the centuries, Lancisi's memory has faded, but his work is still relevant for anyone practicing the medical profession.

AB By early 1954, there existed a plausible model of muscle contraction called the sliding filament model. In addition, the nature of muscle excitation was understood. Surprisingly, the link between the membrane excitation and contraction was entirely unknown. This dilemma has been called the time-distance paradox. The path to discovery of the missing link between excitation and contraction was a rocky one involving the simultaneous but independent development of physiological and morphological studies. From the viewpoint of physiology, significant events included the most thrilling moment of a scientific life, confirmation of a hypothesis that was wrong, a major surprise and shock, a result not expected from evolutionary relationships, and disappointment and confusion before clarity. From the viewpoint of morphology, there was the exciting beginning and rapid development of biological electron microscopy, heroic experiments, the importance of sample preparative procedures, and discovery of clues from the old light microscopic literature. However, it was the confluence of physiology and morphology that brought clarity and a major advance in understanding, leading to the discovery of the transverse tubular system and inward spread of activation in skeletal muscle.

AB In conventional team-based learning (TBL), readiness assurance test (RAT) items must be formatted as free-standing multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Even in the application phase of TBL, all teams must work on the same, significant problem and be required to make a specific choice and simultaneously report them to the whole class, which the MCQ format with predetermined answer choices allows. However, the founders of the TBL method rightly emphasize that the intended learning outcomes of a course using TBL underlie the design of the various components of TBL. The main point of this brief essay is to suggest that, if the ability to generate solutions to problems without predetermined answer choices is an intended learning outcome, it is advantageous to include carefully constructed free-standing, open-ended questions (OEQ) for both RAT and application activities in courses using TBL as the primary instructional method, in addition to the use of MCQs. Freestanding OEQs are OEQs not linked to an MCQ used for RAT or application activities. How this might be incorporated in what one may envision as TBL is discussed.

AB Flipped classroom teaching has been used by many educators to promote active learning in higher education. This andragogy is thought to increase student engagement by making them more accountable for their learning and increase time on task in the classroom. While there are several systematic reviews that point to improved student results, it remains unclear if flipped classrooms have positive learning effects in physiology education. Flipped classroom teaching was introduced in two advanced physiology subjects (advanced neuroscience, semester 1, and cardiorespiratory and renal physiology, semester 2). Changing the mode of content delivery reduced the time students needed to spend listening to lectures by one-third, without sacrificing either learning content or academic standards. Higher pass rates were observed with larger number of students earning distinction and high-distinction grades. Statistically significant improvements in final grades were observed from both subjects (semester 1: 2017. 49.28 +/- 20.16; 2018, 53.29 +/- 19.77, t(268) = 2.058, P = 0.0405; semester 2: 2017, 58.87 +/- 21.19; 2018, 67.91 +/- 20.40, t(111) = 2.306, P = 0.023). Finally, students' perception of their learning experience remained at or above the university benchmarks (median score of >80% for all iterations of the subjects). While the most frequent and persistent area that students suggested could be improved was reduction of content, equal numbers of students commented that no improvement in the subjects was required. Despite the generally positive attitude to recorded didactic teaching content, classroom attendance remained very low, and students did not engage with the active learning content. This suggest that more emphasis needs to be placed on promoting class attendance by developing better active learning content.

AB "Only teach me what I need to know!" This commonly heard refrain is often spoken by allied health students while studying preclinical sciences (physiology, anatomy, pharmacology). Here we use a clinical scenario undertaken by second-year Bachelor of Paramedic Practice students of acute coronary syndrome to demonstrate the difference in clinical decision making when using a clinical reasoning approach to treatment rather than relying exclusively on a practice guidelines approach. We hope to demonstrate that understanding basic bioscience concepts, such as the Frank-Starling mechanism and the anatomy and physiology of the autonomic nervous system, are key to providing good clinical care in response to ambiguous patient symptoms. Students who understand these concepts underlying their patient care guideline will make better clinical decisions and better provide quality of care than students who follow the guideline exclusively. We aim this as a practical demonstration of the value of detailed understanding of human bioscience in allied health education. As health care providers transition from "technician" to "practitioner," the key distinguishing feature of the role is the ability to practice independently, using "best judgment" rather than clinical guidelines (alone). Evidence suggests that complex case management requires detailed bioscience understanding.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different metacognitive interventions on knowledge and regulation of cognition, as well as academic performance (i.e., exam and final grades) in three sections of an undergraduate human anatomy and physiology course. All targeted classes were randomly assigned to one of three groups (reflection practice, passive acquisition of knowledge, and collaborative learning), and the interventions were implemented after exam 1. A pre- and posttest survey was administered during the semester (during week 2 and after exam 2), and exam and final course grades were collected at the end of the semester. The final sample included 129 students. A significant interaction of group and time was observed for knowledge of cognition: it increased in the reflection practice group, did not change in the collaborative learning group, and it decreased in the passive acquisition of knowledge. The interventions did not produce any significant interactions or main effects on regulation of cognition, exam scores, or final grades. Along with more research on metacognition in physiology education contexts, it is recommended to further examine the ways in which such data can be collected, as self-report measures only tell part of the story.

AB A small private online course (SPOC) supports blended learning on a small scale, enabling students to have a more comprehensive and deeper learning experience. It also provides instructors with a flexible and feasible model to better understand the students' learning needs and to supervise students' learning behaviors. In this study, we adopted SPOC flipped classroom blended teaching in the physiology course for clinical undergraduate students of Kunming Medical University. Compared with the control group [lecture-based learning (LBL)], the SPOC flipped classroom method significantly increased the scores of students in the preclass test (65.13 +/- 12.45 vs. 53.46 +/- 8.09, SPOC vs. LBL) and postclass test (80.43 +/- 14.29 vs. 69.01 +/- 12.81, SPOC vs. LBL), which is induced by students' increased interest in self-learning. More importantly, the significant difference between the preclass scores of the two groups suggested that the video lecture-based preview is more effective than the textbook-based preview. The study indicated that the SPOC flipped classroom was effective in enhancing the examination scores of students, reflecting an improved learning efficiency and a deeper understanding of the knowledge. In summary, the flipped classroom based on SPOC improves learning outcomes compared with LBL and has a wide application in the learning of basic medical courses.

AB Student self-assessment using computer-based quizzes has been shown to increase subject memory and engagement. Some types of self-assessment quizzes can be associated with a dilemma between 1) medical students who want the self-assessment quiz to be clearly related to upcoming summative assessments or curated by the exam-setters, and 2) university administrators and ethics committees who want clear guarantees that the self-assessment quizzes are not based on the summative assessments or made by instructors familiar with the exam bank of items. An algorithm in Matlab was developed to formulate multiple-choice questions for both ion transport proteins and pharmacology. A resulting question/item subset was uploaded to the Synap online self-quiz web platform, and 48 year 1 medical students engaged with it for 3 wk. Anonymized engagement statistics for students were provided by the Synap platform, and a paper-based exit questionnaire with an 80% response rate (n = 44) measured satisfaction. Four times as many students accessed the quiz system via laptop compared with phone/tablet. Of 391 questions/items, over 11,749 attempts were made. Greater than 80% of respondents agreed with each of the positive statements (ease of use, enjoyed, engaged more, learned more, and wanted it to be extended to other modules). Despite simplistic questions and rote memorization, the questions developed by this system were engaged with and were received positively. Students strongly supported extending the system.

AB The primary purpose of conducting an interprofessional education (IPE) experience during the renal physiology block of a graduate-level course was to provide basic science, physical therapy, and physician assistant graduate students with an opportunity to work as a team in the diagnosis, treatment, and collaborative care of a patient with acute kidney injury. The secondary purpose was to enhance the understanding of basic renal physiology principles with a patient case presentation of renal pathophysiology. The overall purpose was to assess the value of IPE integration within a basic science course by examining student perceptions and program evaluation. Graduate-level students operated in interprofessional teams while working through an acute kidney injury patient case. The following Interprofessional Education Collaborative subcompetencies were targeted: Roles/Responsibilities (RR) Behavioral Expectations (RR1, RR4) and Interprofessional Communication (CC) Behavioral Expectations (CC4). Clinical and IPE stimulus questions were discussed both within and between teams with assistance provided by faculty facilitators. Students were given a pre- and postsurvey to determine their knowledge of IPE. There were statistically significant increases from pre- to postsurvey scores for all six IPE questions for all students. Physical therapy and physician assistant students had a statistically significant increase in pre-to postsurvey scores, indicating a more favorable perception of their interprofessional competence for RR1, RR4, and CC4. No changes were noted in pre-to postsurvey scores for basic science graduate students. Incorporating planned IPE experiences into multidisciplinary health science courses represents an appropriate venue to have students learn and apply interprofessional competencies.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the potential of a self-designed Facebook page on Neuroscience, to supplement in-class teaching as a mode of blended learning. Posts were split into multiple choice questions (MCQs), general interest articles, neuroscience-related external links and resources, and lecture notes and PowerPoint presentations. The study was divided into three distinct phases: before, during, and after the Neuroscience block. Student responses were evaluated via a self-developed questionnaire. Grades achieved by students undertaking the block in 2015 and 2014 were recorded, as were the grades achieved by the same cohort in concurrent blocks in the same year of study. Results showed that similar to 80% of students reported that use of the page enhanced their overall subject knowledge and exam preparation. Highest page activity occurred during the Neuroscience block. Peak activity occurred directly before summative assessments, with MCQ posts having the highest impact. The cohort of students with access to the Facebook page achieved better grades in the block compared with the previous cohort, despite similar average performance in other subjects. We demonstrate the utility of Facebook as a powerful tool for undergraduate education, supplementing in-class teaching, and assisting in exam preparation, potentially increasing average student performance.

DE cognitive flexibility; ill-structured domains; elaboration; memorization
AB Cognitive flexibility is defined as the ability to assimilate previously learned information and concepts to generate novel solutions to new problems. This skill is crucial for success within ill-structured domains such as biology, physiology, and medicine, where many concepts are simultaneously required for understanding a complex problem, yet the problem consists of patterns or combinations of concepts that are not consistently used or needed across all examples. To succeed within ill-structured domains, a student must possess a certain level of cognitive flexibility: rigid thought processes and prepackaged informational retrieval schemes relying on rote memorization will not suffice. In this study, we assessed the cognitive flexibility of undergraduate physiology students using a validated instrument entitled Student's Approaches to Learning (SAL). The SAL evaluates how deeply and in what way information is processed, as well as the investment of time and mental energy that a student is willing to expend by measuring constructs such as elaboration and memorization. Our results indicate that students who rely primarily on memorization when learning new information have a smaller knowledge base about physiological concepts, as measured by a prior knowledge assessment and unit exams. However, students who rely primarily on elaboration when learning new information have a more well-developed knowledge base about physiological concepts, which is displayed by higher scores on a prior knowledge assessment and increased performance on unit exams. Thus students with increased elaboration skills possibly possess a higher level of cognitive flexibility and are more likely to succeed within ill-structured domains.

AB Here we describe a 4-yr course reform and its outcomes. The upper-division neurophysiology course gradually transformed from a traditional lecture in 2004 to a more student-centered course in 2008, through the addition of evidence-based active learning practices, such as deliberate problem-solving practice on homework and peer learning structures, both inside and outside of class. Due to the incremental nature of the reforms and absence of pre-reform learning assessments, we needed a way to retrospectively assess the effectiveness of our efforts. To do this, we first looked at performance on 12 conserved exam questions. Students performed significantly higher post-reform on questions requiring lower-level cognitive skills and those requiring higher-level cognitive skills. Furthermore, student performance on conserved questions was higher post-reform in both the top and bottom quartiles of students, although lower-quartile student performance did not improve until after the first exam. To examine student learning more broadly, we also used Bloom's taxonomy to quantify a significant increase in the Bloom's level of exams, with students performing equally well post-reform on exams that had over twice as many questions at higher cognitive skill levels. Finally, we believe that four factors provided critical contributions to the success of the course reform, including: transformation efforts across multiple course components, alignment between formative and evaluative course materials, student buy-in to course instruction, and instructional support. This reform demonstrates both the effectiveness of incorporating student-centered, active learning into our course, and the utility of using Bloom's level as a metric to assess course reform.

AB Patients expect physicians to be lifelong learners who are able to interpret and evaluate diagnostic tests, and most medical schools list the development of lifelong learning in their program objectives. However, lecture is the most often utilized form of teaching in the first two years and is considered passive learning. The current generation of medical students has many characteristics that should support active learning pedagogies. The purpose of this study was to analyze student and faculty perceptions of active learning in an integrated medical curriculum at the second-year mark, where students have been exposed to multiple educational pedagogies. The first hypothesis of the study was that faculty would favor active learning methods. The second hypothesis was that Millennial medical students would favor active learning due to their characteristics. Primary faculty for years 1 and 2 and second-year medical students were recruited for an e-mail survey consisting of 12 questions about active learning and lecture. Students perceived that lecture and passive pedagogies were more effective for learning, whereas faculty felt active and collaborative learning was more effective. Students believed that more content should be covered by lecture than faculty. There were also significant differences in perceptions of what makes a good teacher. Students and faculty both felt that lack of time in the curriculum and preparation time were barriers for faculty. The data suggest that students are not familiar with the process of learning and that more time may be needed to help students develop lifelong learning skills.

AB In contrast to peer-assisted learning (PAL) in clinical training, there is scant literature on the efficacy of PAL during basic medical sciences teaching for preclinical students. A group of senior medical students aimed to design and deliver clinically oriented small-group tutorials after every module in the preclinical curriculum at a United Kingdom medical school. Twenty tutorials were delivered by senior students throughout the year to first- and second-year students. A baseline questionnaire was delivered to inform the development of the program followed by an end-point questionnaire the next year (n = 122). Quizzes were administered before and after five separate tutorials to assess changes in mean student scores. Additionally, each tutorial was evaluated via a questionnaire for participants (n = 949). All five posttutorial quizzes showed a significant improvement in mean student score (P < 0.05). Questionnaires showed students found the program to be relevant and useful for revision purposes and appreciated how tutorials contextualized basic science to clinical medicine. Students appreciated the interactive nature of the sessions and found receiving personalized feedback about their learning and consolidating information with someone familiar with the material to be useful. With the inclusion of the program, students felt there were now an adequate number of tutorials during the year. In conclusion, this study shows that senior medical students can design and deliver a program that adds value to the mostly lecture-based formal preclinical curriculum. We hope that our study can prompt further work to explore the effect of PAL on the teaching of basic sciences during preclinical studies.

AB Skinfold assessment is valid and economical; however, it has a steep learning curve, and many programs only include one exposure to the technique. Increasing the number of exposures to skinfold assessment within an undergraduate curriculum would likely increase skill proficiency. The present study combined observational and Think Aloud methodologies to quantify procedural and cognitive characteristics of skinfold assessment. It was hypothesized that 1) increased curricular exposure to skinfold assessment would improve proficiency and 2) the combination of an observational and Think Aloud analysis would provide quantifiable areas of emphasis for instructing skinfold assessment. Seventy-five undergraduates with varied curricular exposure performed a seven-site skinfold assessment on a test subject while expressing their thoughts aloud. A trained practitioner recorded procedural observations, with transcripts generated from audio recordings to capture cognitive information. Skinfold measurements were compared with a criterion value, and bias scores were generated. Participants whose total bias fell within +/- 3.5% of the criterion value were proficient, with the remainder nonproficient. An independent-samples t-test was used to compare procedural and cognitive observations across experience and proficiency groups. Additional curricular exposure improved performance of skinfold assessment in areas such as the measurement of specific sites (e.g., chest, abdomen, and thigh) and procedural (e.g., landmark identification) and cognitive skills (e.g., complete site explanation). Furthermore, the Think Aloud method is a valuable tool for determining curricular strengths and weaknesses with skinfold assessment and as a pedagogical tool for individual instruction and feedback in the classroom.

TI A physiologist's view of homeostasis
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English

DE homeostasis; negative feedback; regulation; core concepts
ID CORE PRINCIPLES
AB Homeostasis is a core concept necessary for understanding the many regulatory mechanisms in physiology. Claude Bernard originally proposed the concept of the constancy of the "milieu interieur," but his discussion was rather abstract. Walter Cannon introduced the term "homeostasis" and expanded Bernard's notion of "constancy" of the internal environment in an explicit and concrete way. In the 1960s, homeostatic regulatory mechanisms in physiology began to be described as discrete processes following the application of engineering control system analysis to physiological systems. Unfortunately, many undergraduate texts continue to highlight abstract aspects of the concept rather than emphasizing a general model that can be specifically and comprehensively applied to all homeostatic mechanisms. As a result, students and instructors alike often fail to develop a clear, concise model with which to think about such systems. In this article, we present a standard model for homeostatic mechanisms to be used at the undergraduate level. We discuss common sources of confusion ("sticky points") that arise from inconsistencies in vocabulary and illustrations found in popular undergraduate texts. Finally, we propose a simplified model and vocabulary set for helping undergraduate students build effective mental models of homeostatic regulation in physiological systems.

AB Cholesterol is a vital structural and functional molecule in the human body that is only slightly soluble in water and therefore does not easily travels by itself in the bloodstream. To enable cholesterol's targeted delivery to cells and tissues, it is encapsulated by different fractions of lipoproteins, complex particles containing both proteins and lipids. Maintaining cholesterol homeostasis is a highly regulated process with multiple factors acting at both molecular and tissue levels. Furthermore, to regulate the circulatory transport of cholesterol in lipoproteins, the amount of cholesterol present depends on and is controlled by cholesterol dietary intake, de novo synthesis, usage, and excretion; abnormal and/or unbalanced cholesterol levels have been shown to lead to severe outcomes, e.g., cardiovascular diseases. To investigate cholesterol transport in the circulatory system, we have previously developed a two-compartment mathematical model. Here, we show how this model can be used as a teaching tool for cholesterol homeostasis. Using the model and a hands-on approach, students can familiarize themselves with the basic components and mechanisms behind balanced cholesterol circulatory transport as well as investigate the consequences of and countermeasures to abnormal cholesterol levels. Among others, various treatments of high blood cholesterol levels can be simulated, e.g., with commonly prescribed de novo cholesterol synthesis inhibitors.

AB Studies of hepatic bile formation reported in 1958 established that it was an osmotically generated water flow. Intravenous infusion of sodium taurocholate established a high correlation between hepatic bile flow and bile acid excretion. Secretin, a hormone that stimulates bicarbonate secretion, was also found to increase hepatic bile flow. The sources of the water entering the biliary system with these two stimuli were differentiated by the use of mannitol. An increase in its excretion parallels the increase in bile flow in response to bile acids but not secretin, which led to a quantitative distinction between canalicular and ductular water flow. The finding of aquaglyceroporin-9 in the basolateral surface of the hepatocyte accounted for the rapid entry of mannitol into hepatocytes and its exclusion from water movement in the ductules where aquaporin-1 is present. Electron microscopy demonstrated that bile acids generate the formation of vesicles that contain lecithin and cholesterol after their receptor-mediated canalicular transport. Biophysical studies established that the osmotic effect of bile acids varies with their concentration and also with the proportion of mono-, di-, and trihydroxy bile acids and provides a basis for understanding their physiological effects. Because of the varying osmotic effect of bile acids, it is difficult to quantify bile acid independent flow generated by other solutes, such as glutathione, which enters the biliary system. Monohydroxy bile acids, by markedly increasing aggregation number, severely reduce water flow. Developing biomarkers for the noninvasive assessment of normal hepatic bile flow remains an elusive goal that merits further study.

ID TRIAL
AB LECTURE-BASED TEACHING (LBT) remains the predominant form of teaching in healthcare profession education (6, 14). It is excellent in providing an overview of a particular topic to a large number of students. However, the concern, which has been highlighted time and again, is the monotony and passive nature of this form of information transmission, which may alienate students away from the learning process (11, 18). It has also been blamed for causing stress and information overload and producing doctors with poor critical thinking and problem-solving skills (8).
   Case-based teaching (CBT) is a teaching technique that exhibits a teacher-dependent approach to large groups of students (23). In contrast to LBT, CBT is interactive, provides increased motivation for learning by using clinical scenarios, and develops an effective clinical reasoning process (10).
   We have been fortunate enough at the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, University of Dammam, a budding institution of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), to introduce a number of innovative teaching techniques emphasizing the interactive form of learning to understand physiological aspects in a better and interesting manner. This is possible only because faculty members have a commitment to development, are willing to step out of their conventional roles and try new approaches, and take risks. One of the techniques was to replace LBT with CBT while retaining large groups of students. The rationale for the use of cases in the lecture was fourfold: 1) to act as a tool to achieve the required knowledge of basic physiological concepts, 2) to provide a scaffold for the organization of facts, 3) to provide exposure to methods of clinical reasoning, and 4) to promote communication skills by fostering active discussion and participation.
   The majority of studies documenting students' better performance in CBT (12, 20, 22) have been done in the United States, Europe, and Australia, whose entry level to a medical education program is graduation, in contrast to the KSA, where entry is at the undergraduate level. Hence, their results cannot be applied to the KSA (as students' maturity may be a factor in the effectiveness of CBT), and it would be a major leap of faith to assume that most medical school entrants in KSA universities will be as mature as medical school entrants in the above-mentioned countries. In the KSA, a recent study (12a) has compared traditional lecturing with problem-based learning (PBL) and shown significant improvement in results. However, due to differences in the PBL technique used in that study (student-centered self-directed learning in small groups facilitated by facilitators with no lectures at all) with those of CBT teacher-centered lecturing in larger groups with incorporation of clinical cases among the lectures), these results cannot be applied to CBT.
   Therefore, we designed the present study to compare the performance of students in two curriculums, i.e., "old" (traditional) versus "new" (CBT). It is the need of the hour. Multiplicity in the medical teaching approach is to be embraced, but only if it will produce better doctors than do traditional curriculums by comparing the doctors produced by new and traditional curriculums. However, by that time, any damage caused by a patchy knowledge base, if at all, would have already occurred (3). This compelled us to conclude that the comparison should begin without delay and should follow doctors as they progress through their career.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DT Editorial Material
AB OUR STUDENTS are not a tabula rasa in classes. These varied learners imbibe new information in relevance to others and reaffirm their own concepts. Quite often, in this journey of forming new connections, inadvertently, misconceptions are retained and may be reinforced if not corrected early. Students come to learning situations with preconceived knowledge and understanding. A constructivist teacher uses this previous knowledge to act as a base for the new knowledge that the student will create.
   One of the ways to induce this conceptual change is by inducing cognitive conflict. This instructional strategy comprises the presentation of anomalous data or contradictory information. The contrasting information stimulates students to formulate their own queries, allows them their own interpretations (reflection and synthesis of new knowledge), and encourages them to arrive at a correlation or conclusion in group work (collaborative learning). Here, I present my experience of introducing a blunder lecture in a large group of students to encourage them to test their conceptual frameworks through a cognitive conflict strategy.

DE antiquity of Exercise Is Medicine; ancient exercise prescriptions;
   contributions of Susruta, Hippocrates; Galen to Exercise Is Medicine
AB In 2007, the American College of Sports Medicine, with endorsement from the American Medical Association and the Office of the Surgeon General, launched a global initiative to mobilize physicians, healthcare professionals and providers, and educators to promote exercise in their practice or activities to prevent, reduce, manage, or treat diseases that impact health and the quality of life in humans. Emerging from this initiative, termed Exercise Is Medicine, has been an extensively documented position stand by the American College of Sports Medicine that recommended healthy adults perform 150 min of moderate dynamic exercise per week. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the foundation for this global initiative and its exercise prescription for health and disease prevention has roots that began in antiquity more than two millennia ago. Individuals and concepts to remember are that Susruta of India was the first "recorded" physician to prescribe moderate daily exercise, Hippocrates of Greece was the first "recorded" physician to provide a written exercise prescription for a patient suffering from consumption, and the global influence of Galen from Rome combined with his recommendation on the use of exercise for patients in the management of disease prevailed until the 16th century. Historically intertwined with these concepts was exercise being advocated by select physicians to minimize the health problems associated with obesity, diabetes, and inactivity.

AB This study investigated the impact of three commonly used cardiovascular model-assisted activities on student learning and student attitudes and perspectives about science. College students enrolled in a Human Anatomy and Physiology course were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (organ dissections, virtual dissections, or plastic models). Each group received a 15-min lecture followed by a 45-min activity with one of the treatments. Immediately after the lesson and then 2 mo later, students were tested on anatomy and physiology knowledge and completed an attitude survey. Students who used plastic models achieved significantly higher overall scores on both the initial and followup exams than students who performed organ or virtual dissections. On the initial exam, students in the plastic model and organ dissection treatments scored higher on anatomy questions than students who performed virtual dissections. Students in the plastic model group scored higher than students who performed organ dissections on physiology questions. On the followup exam, when asked anatomy questions, students in the plastic model group scored higher than dissection students and virtual dissection students. On attitude surveys, organ dissections had higher perceived value and were requested for inclusion in curricula twice as often as any other activity. Students who performed organ dissections were more likely than the other treatment groups to agree with the statement that "science is fun," suggesting that organ dissections may promote positive attitudes toward science. The findings of this study provide evidence for the importance of multiple types of hands-on activities in anatomy laboratory courses.

AB We aimed to compare reported observations, participation in, and perceptions of unprofessional behaviors across preclinical and clinical medical students using a 23-item questionnaire that asked participants whether they witnessed or participated in the behavior and considered it unprofessional. Overall, 111 preclinical (year 3) and 104 clinical (year 4) students responded. For all of the behaviors, significant positive correlations were present between participation and affirmative perceptions. Participation rates for several unprofessional behaviors (14 of 23 items) were higher in the clinical phase. Clinical students more frequently perceived unprofessional behaviors as appropriate (17 of 23 items) compared with preclinical students. In conclusion, both preclinical and clinical medical students in our setting commonly witness unprofessional behaviors. Clinical students participate in and tend to rationalize these behaviors more frequently than preclinical students do.

Adv Physiol Educ 37: 65-69, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00159.2012.-To address the need for greater flexibility in access to higher education, an online graduate course in physiology using case studies was developed and offered in summer 2012. Topics in both animal and human physiology were organized as modules that contained a case study with questions, a prerecorded online lecture, and three research journal articles. We followed best practices for teaching and learning in distance education, including the preparation of materials before the course starting date, a discussion board for responding to pre- and postcase discussion questions, and prompt reply to student queries. For exams, students generated their own questions based on new cases and developed their own case study for the final project. Although only 20% of students had previously taken an online course, all students stated that they would recommend this course to others. Postcase assessment indicated that students found the cases interesting, informative, and presented at the appropriate level. Most students said that the online course took them more time but that they learned more content and used the primary literature more than in a traditional class. Our results indicate that a well-organized physiology course using a case study format is a very effective model for online learning.

AB Cecala AL. Using a classic paper by Evarts as a platform for discussing cortical control of skeletal muscle in awake, behaving primates. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 246-250, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00103.2012.-A growing portion of premedical curricula is being devoted to the study of physiological mechanisms underlying animal behavior. In the present article, I describe an activity centered around a classic Journal of Neurophysiology paper by Edward V. Evarts that lays the foundation for students to investigate common behavioral and physiological techniques used to study motor control in primates. Students will leave this activity being able to 1) critically assess behavioral, electromyographic, and single unit (extracellular) neurophysiological data typically acquired by behavioral neurophysiologists; 2) provide physiological evidence that the primate precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex) controls voluntary movements of the wrist; 3) intelligently discuss hypotheses concerning the role of the primary motor cortex in the generation of movement in mammalian species; and 4) discuss the ethical implications of using mammalian species as model organisms. The skills and background knowledge gained in this activity lay the platform for advanced study of scientific investigations into sensory, motor, and cognitive processes in undergraduate, graduate, or medical school curricula.

Talking about bioelectrical potentials using rings of the mesenteric artery without glass micropipettes. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 336-344, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00050.2012.-In the present study, a practical activity is proposed to adopt an experimental approach to demonstrate the relationship between the equilibrium potential for K+ and transmembrane electrical potential without glass micropipettes. A conventional setup for recording contractile activity of isolated smooth muscle preparations was used based on the events elegantly described by Somlyo and Somlyo in the 1960s. They showed that, in response to a given stimulus, smooth muscle cells may contract, recruiting electromechanical or pharmacomechanical coupling by mechanisms that involve, or not, changes in transmembrane potential, respectively. By means of contractions and relaxations of a ring-like preparation from the rat mesenteric artery, it is possible to observe the functional consequences of handling K+ concentration in the extracellular compartment and the effects caused by opening K+ channels in that preparation, which are significant when the cell membrane establishes an electrical potential difference between intra-and extracellular compartments (driven mainly by K+ permeability under resting conditions). The effects observed by students fit well with values predicted by Nernst and Goldman-Hodgin-Katz equations, and we demonstrated that the activity is able to improve students' comprehension regarding basic principles of bioelectricity.

AB Watenpaugh DE. John Greenleaf's life of science. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 234-245, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00115.2012.-This article summarizes the life and career of John E. Greenleaf, PhD. It complements an interview of Dr. Greenleaf sponsored by the American Physiological Society Living History Project found on the American Physiological Society website. Dr. Greenleaf is a "thought leader" and internationally renowned physiologist, with extensive contributions in human systems-level environmental physiology. He avoided self-aggrandizement and believed that deeds rather than words define one's legacy. Viewed another way, however, Greenleaf's words define his deeds: 48% of his 185 articles are first author works, which is an unusually high proportion for a scientist of his stature. He found that writing a thorough and thoughtful discussion section often led to novel ideas that drove future research. Beyond Greenleaf's words are the many students, postdocs, and collaborators lucky enough to have worked with him and thus learn and carry on his ways of science. His core principles included the following: avoid research "fads," embrace diversity, be the first subject in your own research, adhere to rules of fiscal responsibility, and respect administrative forces-but never back down from them when you know you are right. Greenleaf's integrity ensured he was usually right. He thrived on the axiom of many successful scientists: avoid falling in love with hypotheses, so that when unexpected findings appear, they arouse curiosity instead of fear. Dr. Greenleaf's legacy will include the John and Carol Greenleaf Award for prolific environmental and exercise-related publication in the Journal of Applied Physiology.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 16-21, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00058.2010.-In this article, we review how we interact with medical students in our efforts to teach blood pressure regulation and systemic cardiovascular control along with related elements of respiratory and exercise physiology. Rather than provide a detailed lecture with key facts, we attempted to outline our approach to teaching integrative cardiovascular physiology to medical students, which includes five major themes. First, focus on questions versus answers and facts. We believe that this offers both the learner and teacher a number of advantages. Second, avoid teaching dogma in the name of clarity (i.e., heavy focus on teaching "facts" that have not yet been fully investigated). This is especially important because of the way knowledge evolves over time. Third, include laboratory-based experiences in human integrative physiology. Fourth, provide students with intellectual frameworks versus a list of "facts" to serve as a platform for question generation. Finally, focus on the role of integration and regulatory redundancy in physiology and the idea that physiology is a narrative that can help. In this article, we discuss the philosophy behind the themes outlined above and argue that questions, and not answers, are where the action is for both research and education.

AB Montagna E, Azevedo AM, Romano C, Ranvaud R. What is transmitted in "synaptic transmission"? Adv Physiol Educ 34: 115-116, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00006.2010.-Even students that obtain a high grade in neurophysiology often carry away a serious misconception concerning the final result of the complex set of events that follows the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic terminal. The misconception consists in considering that "at a synapse, information is passed on from one neuron to the next" is equivalent to (and often expressed explicitly as) "the action potential passes from one neuron to the next." More than half of four groups of students who were asked to comment on an excerpt from a recent physiology textbook that openly stated the misconception had no clear objection to the text presented. We propose that the first culprit in generating this misconception is the term "synaptic transmission," which promotes the notion of transferring something or passing something along (implicitly unchanged). To avoid establishing this misconception, the first simple suggestion is to use words like "synaptic integration" rather than " synaptic transmission" right from the start. More generally, it would be important to focus on the function of synaptic events rather than on rote listing of all the numerous steps that are known to occur, which are so complex as to saturate the mind of the student.

AB This article presents a "how-to" guide for redesigning an introductory physiology unit to emphasize the Core Concepts of Physiology. Detailed descriptions are provided of innovative, scalable, adjustments to content delivery, assessment, learning objectives, and activities. Staff reflections and student experience suggest a strong Core Concepts emphasis, while challenging, can promote critical thinking and develop an understanding of underlying chemical, physical and biological principles.
   This article showcases the redesign of an introductory undergraduate vertebrate physiology unit at Murdoch University (BMS107) to promote student mastery of six Core Concepts of Physiology (Michael J, Cliff W, McFarland J, Modell H, Wright A, SpringerLink. The Core Concepts of Physiology: a New Paradigm for Teaching Physiology, 2017). Concepts were selected for their suitability in an introductory physiology unit and their ability to scaffold advanced physiology learning. Innovative curricular and pedagogical approaches were employed to 1) create a Core Concepts structure, 2) sell the Core Concepts approach to students, 3) foreground Core Concepts in learning materials, 4) actively engage students with Core Concepts, 5) revise, and 6) assess Core Concepts understanding. Median student marks and overall satisfaction with the unit were unaffected by the introduction of a Core Concepts approach. Notably, though, there was a 14% increase in student agreement with the statement "I received feedback that helped me to learn." The challenge of the Core Concepts approach was articulated by students, but these novice learners also recognized Core Concepts as a mechanism to focus their understanding of physiology and promote critical thinking. For teaching staff, a Core Concepts approach was a reinvigorating opportunity to apply their expertise to the teaching of introductory physiology. We propose that a strong Core Concepts emphasis, while challenging, is highly rewarding for staff and provides students with a "disciplinary passport" that better prepares them to progress in diverse courses and professions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article presents a "how-to" guide for redesigning an introductory physiology unit to emphasize the Core Concepts of Physiology.

AB The analysis of spontaneous tail coiling (STC) in zebrafish embryos is a functional parameter that allows the study of motor development. It has recently gained relevance as a biomarker to assess the neurotoxicity of environmental substances. Its practicability in the laboratory makes it an excellent pedagogical tool for promoting students' inquiry skills. However, the time and cost of materials and facilities limit their usage in undergraduate laboratories. This study presents the design of a computer-based educational module called ZebraSTMe, which is based on a tail coiling assay and aims to improve science process skills in undergraduate students by connecting them to relevant and novel content. We evaluate students' perception of learning, the quality of materials used, and the knowledge gained. Our results show that students perceived an improvement in their statistical analysis, representation, and discussion of experimental data. Additionally, the students evaluated the quality and ease of use of the materials and provided feedback for revision. A thematic analysis of the opinions revealed that the module activities promoted students' reflection on their professional strengths and weaknesses.NEW & NOTEWORTHY ZebraSTMe is a novel computer-based educational module that utilizes spontaneous tail coiling analysis in zebrafish embryos to enhance undergraduate students' scientific inquiry skills. By addressing the challenges of time, cost, and laboratory resources, the module improves students' science process skills and promotes reflection on their professional strengths and weaknesses. The innovative ZebraSTMe exemplifies the potential of integrating cutting-edge research topics into undergraduate education, leading to more engaging and effective learning experiences in physiology and other scientific disciplines.

AB Fine needle puncture (FNP) is a widespread technique used to collect cellular samples. Its efficiency can be enhanced by the use of ultrasonography to guide the procedure. Ultrasound-guided FNP is therefore an operator-dependent exam. For this rea-son, it demands the acquisition of psychomotor skill, ability to recognize structures, and dexterity during the needle puncture. This study describes the development of an artisanal simulator made with gelatin to replace the use of live animals during practi-cal classes in veterinary or medical sciences education. The experimental set consisted of three phases in which the student performed different tasks such as recognition of the target structure with ultrasound and injection of ink (phase 1) or aspiration (phase 2) of its content and evaluation of a parenchymatous organ (liver) and puncture of its surface (phase 3). A survey on the acceptance of the model was carried out, and students filled out a questionnaire elaborated with the visual analog scale system. Participants considered the artisanal model a strong method to teach ultrasound-guided FNP. Other attractive advantages of this simulator are the low manufacturing costs (compared with expensive high-technology devices) and the possibility to replace the use of live animals in practical classes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study describes an artisanal simulator made with gelatin to teach ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture during practical classes in veterinary or medical sciences education. A three-phase experimental set allowed the stu-dents to practice ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture, aspiration, and injection in three different target structures. This cost-effective simulator may be an alternative to the use of expensive devices or the use of live animals during practical classes.

AB Medical graduates are expected to apply scientific principles and explain the processes underlying common and important dis-eases. Evidence shows that integrated medical curricula, which deliver biomedical science within the context of clinical cases, facilitate student learning in preparation for practice. However, research has also shown that the student's perception of their knowledge can be lower in integrated compared to traditional courses. Thus the development of teaching methods to support both integrated learning and build student confidence in clinical reasoning is a priority. In this study, we describe the use of an audience response system to support active learning in large classes. Sessions, delivered by medical faculty from both academic and clinical backgrounds, were designed to build on the knowledge of the respiratory system in both health and disease through the interpretation of clinical cases. Results showed that student engagement was high throughout the session and stu-dents strongly agreed that the application of knowledge to real-life cases was a better way to understand clinical reasoning. Qualitative free text comments revealed that students liked the link between theory and practice and the active, integrated method of learning. In summary, this study describes a relatively simple but highly effective way of delivering integrated medical science teaching, in this case respiratory medicine, to improve student confidence in clinical reasoning. This educational approach was applied within the early years of the curriculum in preparation for teaching within a hospital setting, but the format could be applied across many different settings. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development of teaching methods that support integrated learning and build student confidence is a priority. An audience response system was used to engage early year medical students in large classes in preparation for teaching within a hospital setting. Results showed high levels of student engagement and a greater appreciation for the link between theory and practice. This study describes a simple, active, and integrated method of learning that improves student confidence in clinical reasoning.

AB Undergraduate programs related to allied health are often pursued by students to prepare for entrance into professional programs, but many students also ask about what types of employment options they may have upon completion of the bachelor's degree. This experiential learning course in cardiovascular and sleep technology was designed to provide opportunities for students to gain hands-on clinical skills that could help them to enter professional programs or to find employment in an allied health field such as cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, cardiovascular technology, or sleep technology. The prerequisites for this course were the completion of two semesters of anatomy and physiology. This course was based on experiential learning and was structured into three modules: clinical exercise physiology, autonomic physiology, and sleep physiology. As part of the course students completed a 4-page scientific report for one designated topic within each of the modules. The two exams in the course were essay based. The design of this course required students to review key topics from anatomy and physiology, to comprehend peer-reviewed manuscripts, to gain hands-on experiences with sophisticated physiological equipment, to work as individuals and in groups, and to become better oral and written communicators. The sleep physiology module included an introduction to electroencephalography (EEG) and a student-led nap study, which may be an effective way to introduce students to sleep medicine. We are hopeful that the summary of this course will be useful to physiology educators as they work to provide the most meaningful experiences to their undergraduates in the health sciences.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Experiential learning in clinical exercise, autonomic regulation, and sleep physiology is an impactful way to train undergraduate biomedical students to enter a variety of careers in healthcare, graduate programs in the health professions, or traditional research graduate programs. A hands-on course such as Cardiovascular and Sleep Technology provides a way, in addition to or independent of original research, to provide clinically relevant training.

AB The physiology core concepts are designed to guide instructors in undergraduate physiology courses. However, although past work has characterized the alignment of physiology programs with the core concepts, it is unclear to what extent these core concepts have influenced instructors' pedagogical decisions or how represented these core concepts are across physiology courses. We surveyed undergraduate physiology instructors to determine their familiarity with the core concepts, the impact of the core concepts on their teaching, as well as the alignment of their courses with these core concepts. Instructors report predominantly relying on textbooks and past syllabi of their courses as resources that influence their instructional decisions on which topics to include in a course. However, many instructors report reorganizing their physiology courses in subsequent iterations or reducing the number of concepts covered to allow more time for critical thinking and active learning. In addition, we find that the majority of instructors indicate that they are not knowledgeable about the list of physiology core concepts and that the influence of these core concepts is limited even for those who report familiarity with the list of core concepts. Finally, we find that instructors report uneven coverage of physiology core concepts in their courses, with some core concepts ubiquitous while others are sparsely covered. We conclude by discussing implications of our work for the physiology education community and call for the continued development of resources to support new physiology instructors and the need to promote coverage of certain core concepts in physiology courses.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The physiology core concepts are a critical resource for undergraduate physiology instructors. Despite this, little past work has investigated the impact of these core concepts across institutions. We find that most instructors are unfamiliar with these core concepts and instead rely on other resources when developing and revamping their physiology courses. We also identify uneven coverage of the core concepts in the curriculum and offer implications for the physiology education community.

ID JUNIOR FACULTY
AB The Oklahoma IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (OK-INBRE) provides a formalized mentoring program and grant awards to new and early-stage faculty throughout Oklahoma. The OK-INBRE Research Project Investigator (RPI) award program has supported 30 faculty from both research-intensive universities and primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) over the past 15 yr. To examine the impact of this program, we assessed the career trajectory of OK-INBRE RPI awardees and compared their productivity with a control group of applicants who applied for but did not receive an RPI award. A mixed-methods approach was employed to assess longitudinal programmatic impact. Regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of an RPI award on faculty productivity, controlling for institutional affiliation. Key informant interviews were conducted to capture qualitative information about satisfaction and additional outcomes. OK-INBRE RPI awardees had a higher number in total and mean number of publications. In achieving extramural funding, RPI awardees were 12.5 times (P = 0.005) as likely to receive a grant award of any type and 4.5 times (P = 0.06) as likely to receive a subsequent federal grant as those in the control group. Many RPI awardees attributed their career success to OK-INBRE, but they also helped to identify barriers to advancement or productivity associated with their specific home institutions. The combined data indicate that OK-INBRE plays a significant role in launching new and early-stage investigators on a path toward independent research careers, which will in turn have a positive impact on the future of the biomedical research enterprise in Oklahoma.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The Oklahoma IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (OK-INBRE) has been offering a formalized mentoring program and grant awards to new and early-stage faculty throughout Oklahoma for the past 15 yr.

ID CORE PRINCIPLES
AB Anecdotal data suggest great variation in breadth and depth of skeletal muscle coverage between undergraduate human anatomy (HA) and anatomy and physiology (A&P) courses. This manuscript is the second in a series (Reynolds A, Goodwin M, O'Loughlin VD. Adv Physiol Educ 46: 309-318, 2022. doi:https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00084.2021) that methodically assesses skeletal muscle content coverage across undergraduate HA and A&P courses. The authors developed an online skeletal muscle coverage survey and collected 342 responses worldwide, 156 from instructors of HA courses and 186 from A&P course instructors. Demographic results showed that HA courses are primarily taught at 4-year baccalaureate institutions, have relatively larger class sizes, and are more likely to use human (vs. animal) prosections or dissections. In contrast, A&P courses are primarily taught at community colleges, have relatively smaller class sizes, and are more likely to use animal (vs. human) dissections. HA courses tend to require their students to learn all skeletal muscle aspects (i.e., identification, action, attachments, innervation), whereas A&P courses tend to focus on muscle identification or action only. The proportions of courses that require identification of large, superficial skeletal muscles are similar between the two course types. However, HA courses are more likely to require their students to identify deeper and smaller muscles, including more distal appendicular muscles and pelvic muscles. These differences likely are due, in part, to the more anatomical focus of HA courses and the slightly different student populations between these courses. These findings provide much-needed information about muscular system coverage between HA and A&P courses and may guide instructor discussions about curricula.

AB Lectures constitute a basic component of physiology instruction in scientific and healthcare curricula. Technological progress has allowed a switch from face to face to video lectures, yet there is no evidence of video efficacy in physiology. Because videos increase the cognitive load during a learning task, identifying tools that decrease students' cognitive load during video lectures is critical. Segmenting videos with pauses and inducing joint attention with eye movement modeling examples (EMME) could reduce the cognitive load and improve second-year medical students' learning in physiology video lectures. Second-year medical students were randomized into four groups [EMME + pauses (EMME + P), EMME without pause's (EMME-NoP), pauses only (NoEMME + P), and no EMME and no pause (NoEMME-NoP)], took pretest quizzes, watched a renal physiology video lecture, and answered a cognitive load questionnaire and posttest quizzes on the Moodie learning management system. Student prior knowledge was assessed by a pretest, and learning gains were assessed by the difference between posttest and pretest scores. One hundred ninety-five students completed the experiment. Pauses improved learning gains (P < 0.01) but not EMME (P = 0.11). Student prior knowledge has several interactions with other variables: low-prior knowledge students obtained better learning gains (P < 0.001) and high-prior knowledge students had lower learning gains with EMME (P < 0.05). Our study shows the potential role of tools designed to reduce students' cognitive load during a renal physiology video lecture and the critical need for empirical validation of pedagogical solutions that are adapted to the specificities of physiology lectures.

AB This article provides a qualitative examination of student responses to an enjoyable online experience illustrating structure-function relationships of chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) in the human nervous system via text messaging emojis (often employed during mobile phone messaging). The "N.A.M.E." (Neurotransmitters as Messaging Emojis) FUN! experience was presented to 216 undergraduate health professions students enrolled in a human physiology course during Spring 2020 (N = 117) and Spring 2021 (N = 99) semesters as a learning tool, during a time in which students struggled with the concepts of neurotransmitter function. Additional goals for this fun experience design are to 1) engage health professions students in the topics of chemical messengers in the nervous system, and provide 2) a learning tool for students enrolled in the human physiology courses and 3) a memorization online worksheet for select neurotransmitter function. Student participants were able to access the online neurotransmitter fun experience via mobile phone and/or laptop. Resulting analyses of the voluntary and anonymous survey highlight positive responses in both Spring 2020 and 2021 semesters to the online "N.A.M.E." experience and furthermore the recommendation of student participants to include this online experience in future lecture assignments for the Human Physiology course. Here, we examine several data sets (tables) as we review student choices for matching emojis to neurotransmitter function and qualitative responses on the efficacy of this online match-up fun as a learning tool in a human physiology course for health professions.

AB Certain physiology concepts can be difficult for students to understand, and new strategies need to be implemented to teach these concepts. Cell signaling is a core concept in physiology and is presented to undergraduate students starting with their first-year Principles of Biology course. Flipped teaching (FT) combined with dramatizations were used to teach steroid hormone and protein hormone cell signaling in an Animal Physiology course. Student knowledge level improved, as demonstrated by posttest scores compared to pretest scores. Their confidence level in the material improved after the dramatization activities were completed. In conclusion, the combination of FT with dramatizations enhances student learning and confidence level.

AB This article discusses the chalk talk's potential as an active learning method. Although chalk talks are a form of interactive lecture, they have received little attention in the medical education literature compared with other active learning methods such as team-based learning and simulation. One of the authors (C. K. L. Phoon) has used chalk talks to teach congenital heart defects to first- and third-year NYU medical students for many years. His chalk talks have consistently earned among the highest teaching scores, and students have noted their strengths of being more interesting, clear, and tangible than didactic lectures. Using the teacher and student perspectives, we examine the chalk talk's strengths and weaknesses compared with common passive and active learning methods. Chalk talks create a real-time, shared space that facilitates the active learning goals of helping students build, test, and revise mental models (conceptual frameworks). The limited amount of information that can be presented and the ability to solicit and arrange students' ideas on the board lead to the cocreation of valuable conceptual frameworks. Chalk talks require less restructuring of teaching sessions than other active learning methods and are best suited to topics that hinge on understanding of concepts. We advocate for the chalk talk to be reexamined as a promising educational tool given its strengths and the successes that other active learning methods have shown. Furthermore, we provide guidance to help educators deliver chalk talks and discuss future studies that would advance understanding of this powerful teaching tool.

AB This study is aimed at the implementation of a continuous assessment model in physiology for a large-enrollment classroom with 250 students. The readiness assurance process (RAP) and immediate feedback elements from team-based learning (TBL) methodology were adopted to test their ability to guide students to solve applications exercises individually. Three continuous assessments in physiology (CAPs) were conducted with the RAP to include individual (iRAT) and group readiness assurance tests (gRAT). Immediate feedback was provided with faculty-student discussion (FSD), and the individual application exercises (iAE) were designed to be answered individually. Each CAP was subjected to three types of experimental manipulation in subgroups created out of 250 students. The intervention began with iRAT for all three subgroups. The sequence of iRAT. gRAT, FSD, and iAE varied between subgroups within a CAP. In a cross-over study design, each subgroup of students was subjected to all three intervention types over three CAPs. The subgroup completing iAE after RAP and FSD showed higher scores than the subgroup with RAP alone. One hundred eight-two students (82.35% response rate; 101 women and 81 men) responded to the questionnaire. The majority of students (87.4%) felt that doing iRAT and gRAT at the beginning helped them to solve iAE better. Most of the students (86.8%) responded that they received useful feedback and clarification during the discussion with the teacher after the gRAT. In conclusion, the administration of iRAT first followed by gRAT and immediate feedback from faculty seem to be beneficial to prepare students to tackle application-based exercises.

AB This work describes the educational game "Integrating Synapse, Muscle Contraction, and Autonomic Nervous System," which was developed to assist students in understanding and integrating concepts related to the physiology of synapses, muscle contraction, and the autonomic nervous system. Analysis was made of the effect of the game on learning and the students' opinions about it. Dentistry students were divided into control and game groups. They attended lectures about the topics, after which the control group students were submitted to a test, whereas the game group performed the game activity before undertaking the test. The mean score was significantly higher for the game group, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Pharmacy students also attended lectures about these topics; in the next class, the students performed a pretest and the activity with the educational game. After the game, a posttest was applied. The mean scores were significantly higher for the posttest than for the pretest (P < 0.05). Students of medicine attended the lectures and performed the activity with the educational game. without the learning assessment. All of the students answered a question. using a 5-point Likert-type scale, concerning whether they thought the activity with the game was useful for learning. The mean scores obtained by the dentistry, pharmacy, and medicine students were 4.7 +/- 0.6, 4.9 +/- 0.3, and 4.3 +/- 0.1, respectively. The educational game increased the learning of the undergraduate students, in agreement with their opinions of the strategy.

AB Although hands-on experience in hematology practical work has been an integral part of physiology education, the students' perception on the importance of the same has remained largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to explore students' perception on the importance of "doing" hematology experiments. The first-year medical students of the 2017-18 batch filled out a semistructured questionnaire at the end of the course of hematology practicals. The questionnaire captured their perception of the importance of doing hematology practicals on their own blood, the assessment of the same, and its value in medical training. Students indicated that doing practicals individually by pricking themselves was a necessary part of physiology teaching (n = 126 responses: 43 men, 83 women; 86%). They felt that it not only improved their knowledge (n = 120: 39 men, 81 women; 82%) and fine-motor skills (n = 107: 41 men. 66 women; 73%), but also molded their attitude (n = 101: 41 men, 60 women; 69%), gearing them to become empathetic and confident doctors. They felt that some practicals were unnecessary/ outdated; this needs attention. While suggesting a few modifications in the practical curriculum, almost all students felt that the practicals should be continued for future batches. Students felt that doing hematology practical work was a necessary part of their training. It improved their knowledge, skills, and attitude. making them more empathetic and confident doctors.

AB An understanding of the complexity of the cardiovascular system is incomplete without a knowledge of the venous system. It is important for students to understand that, in a closed system, like the circulatory system. changes to the venous side of the circulation have a knock-on effect on heart function and the arterial system and vice versa. Veins are capacitance vessels feeding blood to the right side of the heart. Changes in venous compliance have large effects on the volume of blood entering the heart and hence cardiac output by the Frank-Starling Law. In healthy steady-state conditions, venous return has to equal cardiac output, i.e., the heart cannot pump more blood than is delivered to it. A sound understanding of the venous system is essential in understanding how changes in cardiac output occur with changes in right atrial pressure or central venous pressure, and the effect these changes have on arterial blood pressure regulation. The aim of this paper is to detail simple hands-on physiological assessments that can be easily undertaken in the practical laboratory setting and that illustrate some key functions of veins. Specifically. we illustrate that venous valves prevent the backflow of blood, that venous blood pressure increases from the heart to the feet, that the skeletal muscle pump facilitates venous return, and we investigate the physiological and clinical significance of central venous pressure and how it may be assessed.

AB The basis for understanding neurophysiology is understanding ion movement across cell membranes. Students in introductory courses recognize ion concentration gradients as a driving force for ion movement but struggle to simultaneously account for electrical charge gradients. We developed a 17-multiple-choice item assessment of students' understanding of electrochemical gradients and resistance in neurophysiology, the Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device (EGAD). We investigated the internal evidence validity of the assessment by analyzing item characteristic curves of score probability and student ability for each question. and a Wright map of student scores and ability. We used linear mixed-effect regression to test student performance and ability. Our assessment discriminated students with average ability (weighted likelihood estimate: -2 to 1.5 Theta); however, it was not as effective at discriminating students at the highest ability (weighted likelihood estimate: >2 Theta). We determined the assessment could capture changes in both assessment scores (model r(2) = 0.51, P < 0.001, n = 444) and ability estimates (model r(2) = 0.47, P < 0.001, n = 444) after a simulation-based laboratory and course instruction for 222 students. Differential item function analysis determined that each item on the assessment performed equitably for all students, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, or economic status. Overall, we found that men scored higher (r(2) = 0.51, P = 0.014, n = 444) and bad higher ability scores (P = 0.003) on the EGAD assessment. Caucasian students of both genders were positively correlated with score (r(2) = 0.51, P < 0.001, n = 444) and ability (r(2) = 0.47, P < 0.001, n = 444). Based on the evidence gathered through our analyses, the scores obtained from the EGAD can distinguish between levels of content knowledge on neurophysiology principles for students in introductory physiology courses.

ID LIKERT; ATTITUDES; PHYSICS
AB Human Anatomy and Physiology (HAP) has long been recognized as a difficult course. A 2007 study (Michael J. Adv Physiol Educ 31: 34-40, 2007) sought to better understand this difficulty by asking faculty for their perceptions of why students struggle to learn in HAP. Later research built on these findings by investigating why students find physiology difficult (Sturges D, Maurer T. Internet J Allied Health Sci Pract 11: 1-10, 2013). However, without replication, these claims are limited in their generalizability. There is a need in physiology education research to replicate studies like these across different institutions to support generalizations. We, therefore, replicated both of these studies by collecting survey responses from 466 students at 4 different institutions and 17 instructors at 15 different institutions. We found that students in our study identified similar factors as the students surveyed in the original study. Students most strongly agreed with items that attributed the difficulty of HAP to the nature of the discipline, as opposed to the way physiology is taught or the way students approach learning it. Faculty in our sample, like those in the original study by Michael, agreed most strongly with items that attributed physiology's difficulty to discipline specific factors. Our data reinforce the results of Sturges and Maurer and Michael. We can more confidently claim that HAP students and faculty believe the difficulty in learning physiology is the result of inherent features of the discipline itself and not factors related to instruction or the students themselves.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE IV fluid therapy; osmolarity; osmosis; tonicity; osmolality
AB Understanding osmolarity and tonicity is one of the more challenging endeavors undertaken by students of the natural sciences. We asked students who completed a course in animal physiology to submit an essay explaining what they found most perplexing about this subject, and what in-class activities proved most useful to them. Students had difficulty distinguishing osmolarity from tonicity and determining tonicity based on the solution's composition. The most useful activities were questions requiring simultaneous consideration of both osmolarity and tonicity. Problems that require calculating osmotic concentration and the volumes of body fluid compartments after administration or loss of various solutions emphasize the significance of osmolarity and tonicity in the context of systemic homeostasis and clinical medicine. We hope that our approach to teaching osmolarity and tonicity will prove useful to physiology lecturers who are looking for new ways of introducing this complicated topic to their health professions students.

ID IMPLEMENTATION; MODEL
AB The flipped classroom has been shown to have positive outcomes in learning. However. relatively little has been reported on the implementation of it in dental education. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the flipped classroom on predoctoral dental students' learning. Two consecutive classes of dental students learned the physiology of the autonomic nervous system through the nonflipped (traditional lecture) or the flipped approach. Students' learning was assessed with an identical quiz at the end of the module. The mean score in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach (P < 0.01). Mean score on the content-based quiz questions in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach (P < 0.05). Performance on case-based questions did not show a significant difference (P = 0.12). Mean quiz performance of the lower 27% scorers in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach (P < 0.05). Mean quiz performance of the upper 27% scorers showed an increase in the flipped approach as well (P < 0.05). but to a less extent than that of the lower 27% scorers (P < 0.01). The flipped approach also increased peer collaboration (P < 0.01). In summary, the flipped classroom improved dental students' performance on content-based questions in physiology. The flipped classroom narrowed the performance gap between the low- and high-performing dental students.

ID PUBLIC COMMUNICATION; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; SCIENTISTS; SKILLS; ENGAGEMENT
AB The ability to clearly disseminate scientific knowledge is a skill that is necessary for any undergraduate student within the sciences. Traditionally, this is accomplished through the instruction of scientific presentation or writing with a focus on peer-to-peer communication at the expense of teaching communication aimed at a nonscientific audience. One of the ramifications of focusing on peer-to-peer communication has presented itself as an apprehension toward scientific knowledge within the general populace. This apprehension can be seen in a variety of venues, including the traditional media, popular culture, and education, which generally paint scientists as aloof and with an inability to discuss scientific issues to anyone other than other scientists. This paper describes a curriculum designed to teach Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology students the tools necessary for communicating complex concepts that were covered during the semester using approachable language. Students were assessed on their word usage in associated writing activities, the student's ability to reduce complexity of their statements, and performance in an informal scientific presentation to a lay audience. Results showed that this pedagogical approach has increased students' ability to reduce the complexity of their language in both a written and oral format. This, in turn, led to evaluators reporting greater levels of understanding of the topic presented following the presentation.

AB We have created and validated a conceptual framework for the core physiology concept of "cell-cell communication." The conceptual framework is composed of 51 items arranged in a hierarchy that is, in some instances, four levels deep. We have validated it with input from faculty who teach at a wide variety of institutional types. All items making up the framework were deemed essential to moderately important. However, some of the main ideas were clearly judged to be more important than others. Furthermore, the lower in the hierarchy an item is, the less important it is thought to be. Finally, there was no significant difference in the ratings given by faculty at different types of institutions.

AB The monotony of conventional didactic lectures makes students less attentive toward learning, and they tend to memorize isolated facts without understanding, just for the sake of passing exams. Therefore, to promote a habit of gaining indepth knowledge of basic sciences in medical undergraduates along with honing of their communication and analytical skills, we introduced this more interactive way of learning. The present study was performed on 99 first-semester medical students. After conventional didactic lectures, students were asked to prepare small conceptual questions on the topic. They were divided into two teams, which were made to ask questions to each other. If a team failed to answer, the student who questioned was supposed to answer to the satisfaction of the other team's student. Data were then obtained by getting feedback from the students on a 10-item questionnaire, and statistical evaluation was done using MS Excel and SPSS. To draft questions, students went through the whole system comprehensively and made questions from every possible aspect of the topic. Some of the questions (30%) were of recall type, but most judged higher cognitive domains. Student feedback revealed that they were satisfied, motivated to read more, and were confident of applying this learning and communication skills in future clinical practice. Students also expressed their desire to implement this activity as a regular feature of the curriculum. The activity resulted in an increase in student perceptions of their knowledge on the topic as well as communicative and analytical skills. This may eventually lead to better learning.

The first ITL was held in June 2014, and the second ITL will be in June 2016. A Physiology Education Community of Practice was created to help connect the institute participants and other physiology educators to share evidence-based teaching in physiology at all education levels and ideas for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning and Discipline-Based Education Research in physiology. This editorial describes the origins and outcomes of the ITL and the advantages of joining the Physiology Education Community of Practice.

AB Many studies have emphasized the incorporation of active learning into classrooms to reinforce didactic lectures for physiology courses. This work aimed to determine if presenting classic papers during didactic lectures improves the learning of physiology among undergraduate students. Twenty-two students of health information technology were randomly divided into the following two groups: 1) didactic lecture only (control group) and 2) didactic lecture plus paper presentation breaks (DLPP group). In the control group, main topics of gastrointestinal and endocrine physiology were taught using only the didactic lecture technique. In the DLPP group, some topics were presented by the didactic lecture method (similar to the control group) and some topics were taught by the DLPP technique (first, concepts were covered briefly in a didactic format and then reinforced with presentation of a related classic paper). The combination of didactic lecture and paper breaks significantly improved learning so that students in the DLPP group showed higher scores on related topics compared with those in the control group (P < 0.001). Comparison of the scores of topics taught by only the didactic lecture and those using both the didactic lecture and paper breaks showed significant improvement only in the DLPP group (P < 0.001). Data obtained from the final exam showed that in the DLPP group, the mean score of the topics taught by the combination of didactic lecture and paper breaks was significantly higher than those taught by only didactic lecture (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the combination of paper presentation breaks and didactic lectures improves the learning of physiology.

AB Used effectively, stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) technologies can engage students with complex disciplinary content as they are presented with informative representations of abstract concepts. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that stereoscopy may enhance learning and retention in some educational settings. Biological concepts particularly benefit from this type of presentation since complex spatially oriented structures frequently define function within these systems. Viewing biological phenomena in 3D as they are in real life allows the user to relate these spatial relationships and easily grasp concepts making the key connection between structure and function. In addition, viewing these concepts interactively in 3D and in a manner that leads to increased engagement for young prospective scientists can further increase the impact. We conducted two studies evaluating the use of this technology as an instructional tool to teach high school students complex biological concepts. The first study tested the use of stereoscopic materials for teaching brain function and human anatomy to four classes. The second study evaluated stereoscopic images to support the learning of cell structure and DNA in four different high school classes. Most important, students who used stereoscopic 3D had significantly higher test scores than those who did not. In addition, students reported enjoying 3D presentations, and it was among their top choices for learning about these complex concepts. In summary, our evidence adds further support for the benefits of 3D images to students' learning of science concepts.

AB The earthworm is ideal for studying action potential conduction velocity in a classroom setting, as its simple linear anatomy allows easy axon length measurements and the worm's sparse coding allows single action potentials to be easily identified. The earthworm has two giant fiber systems (lateral and medial) with different conduction velocities that can be easily measured by manipulating electrode placement and the tactile stimulus. Here, we present a portable and robust experimental setup that allows students to perform conduction velocity measurements within a 30-min to 1-h laboratory session. Our improvement over this well-known preparation is the combination of behaviorally relevant tactile stimuli (avoiding electrical stimulation) with the invention of minimal, low-cost, and portable equipment. We tested these experiments during workshops in both a high school and college classroom environment and found positive learning outcomes when we compared pre- and posttests taken by the students.

AB Mobile learning has increasingly become interwoven into the fabric of learning and teaching in the United Kingdom higher education sector, and as technological issues become addressed, this phenomena has accelerated. The aim of the study was to examine whether learning using a mobile learning device (Samsung NC10 Netbook) loaded with interactive exercises promoted learning compared with a traditional library exercise. Using a randomized trial, 55 students from an undergraduate sports science course (n = 28) and medical course (n = 27) volunteered to participate in this study. A mixed-model design ANOVA was used to examine the percent change in test score after a 3-wk intervention. Results showed that there was a significant difference between the two courses (P < 0.001), methods (P = 0.01), and trials (P < 0.001). The findings suggested that both methods augmented student knowledge and understanding in sports science and medical students. The sports science group demonstrated proportionally greater increases in test performance when exposed to the mobile interactive intervention compared with the traditional library approach. Qualitative data suggest an increased level of engagement with the Netbooks due to the stimulating interactive content. In conclusion, the Netbooks were an effective additional learning tool, significantly enhancing knowledge and understanding in students. Further research should ensure that participants are assessed for preferred learning styles, the subjective task value of expectancy value, and readiness for mobile learning to ascertain if this has an effect on the potential for using mobile learning and interactivity.

AB In the present article, a novel model of artificial membranes that provides efficient assistance in teaching the origins of diffusion potentials is proposed. These membranes are made of polycarbonate filters fixed to 12-mm plastic rings and then saturated with a mixture of creosol and n-decane. The electrical resistance and potential difference across these membranes can be easily measured using a low-cost volt-ohm meter and home-made Ag/AgCl electrodes. The advantage of the model is the lack of ionic selectivity of the membrane, which can be modified by the introduction of different ionophores to the organic liquid mixture. A membrane treated with the mixture containing valinomycin generates voltages from -53 to -25 mV in the presence of a 10-fold KCl gradient (in to out) and from -79 to -53 mV in the presence of a bi-ionic KCl/NaCl gradient (in to out). This latter bi-ionic gradient potential reverses to a value from +9 to +20 mV when monensin is present in the organic liquid mixture. Thus, the model can be build stepwise, i.e., all factors leading to the development of diffusion potentials can be introduced sequentially, helping students to understand the quantitative relationships of ionic gradients and differential membrane permeability in the generation of cell electrical signals.

AB Eagleton S, Muller A. Development of a model for whole brain learning of physiology. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 421-426, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00007.2011.-In this report, a model was developed for whole brain learning based on Curry's onion model. Curry described the effect of personality traits as the inner layer of learning, information-processing styles as the middle layer of learning, and environmental and instructional preferences as the outer layer of learning. The model that was developed elaborates on these layers by relating the personality traits central to learning to the different quadrants of brain preference, as described by Neethling's brain profile, as the inner layer of the onion. This layer is encircled by the learning styles that describe different information-processing preferences for each brain quadrant. For the middle layer, the different stages of Kolb's learning cycle are classified into the four brain quadrants associated with the different brain processing strategies within the information processing circle. Each of the stages of Kolb's learning cycle is also associated with a specific cognitive learning strategy. These two inner circles are enclosed by the circle representing the role of the environment and instruction on learning. It relates environmental factors that affect learning and distinguishes between face-to-face and technology-assisted learning. This model informs on the design of instructional interventions for physiology to encourage whole brain learning.

AB Gurpinar E, Bati H, Tetik C. Learning styles of medical students change in relation to time. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 000-000; doi:10.1152/advan.00047.2011.-The aim of the present study was to investigate if any changes exist in the learning styles of medical students over time and in relation to different curriculum models with these learning styles. This prospective cohort study was conducted in three different medical faculties, which implement problem-based learning ( PBL), hybrid, and integrated curriculum models. The study instruments were Kolb's Learning Style Inventory ( LSI) and a questionnaire describing the students' demographic characteristics. Sample selection was not done, and all first-year students ( n = 547) were targeted. This study was designed in two phases. In the first year, the study instruments were delivered to the target group. The next year, the same instruments were delivered again to those who had fully completed the first questionnaire ( n = 525). Of these, 455 students had completed the instruments truly and constituted the study group. The majority of the students were assimilators and convergers in both the first and second years. A change in learning style was observed between 2 yr in 46.9% of the students in the integrated curriculum, in 49.3% of the students in the hybrid curriculum, and 56.4% of the students in the PBL curriculum. The least and most changes observed between the learning style groups were in assimilators and divergers, respectively. Curriculum models and other independent variables had no significant effect on the change between learning styles. The learning styles of medical students may change over time. Further followup studies in larger groups are needed to clarify this relation.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic and worldwide lockdowns brought major changes in education systems. There was a sudden obliga-tory shift toward utilization of digital resources for teaching and learning purposes. Medical education, specifically physiology teaching, comprises hands-on training in the laboratory. It is challenging to offer a course like physiology in a virtual format. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and influence of virtual classroom technology on online physiology edu-cation in a sample size of 83 first-year MBBS undergraduates. A questionnaire comprising questions related to technology accessibility and utilization, comprehensibility and effectiveness of instructions, faculty proficiency, and learning outcomes was administered to the group. The responses were collected and analyzed. Validation through principal components and factor analysis showed that online teaching is not very effective and has a limited application in the physiology education of under-graduate MBBS students. Our study also revealed that virtual physiology teaching of undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic had a moderate level of effectiveness. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the present qualitative study, we have conducted and validated an online physiology teaching plat-form at a medical college to continue medical education during the peak times of the COVID-19 pandemic and prolonged lock -downs. Furthermore, we have evaluated the effectiveness of online physiology teaching through multidimensional feedback from undergraduate MBBS students. It is experimental evidence of inadequate sustainability, moderate efficacy, limited applica-tion, and poor first-hand experience gained by the students in virtual physiology teaching in a preclinical and clinical setting.

AB To retain students on academic probation, physiology and physiology-related programs may offer a variety of academic support initiatives. This pilot research study examined the feasibility and perceptions of implementing a success coach-led physical activity (PA) program for freshmen on academic probation in a physiology-related program. Freshman on academic probation [grade point average (GPA) < 2.0] worked with a success coach on academic success strategies and PA. Freshmen completed validated surveys (Academic Self-Efficacy, Self-Efficacy of Regulated Learning, Institutional Integration Scale) before and after intervention and semistructured interviews after intervention. Retention rate was determined at longitudinal follow-up in Fall 2022. Six freshmen participated. Average GPA did not improve between Fall 2021 (1.561 +/- 0.285) and Spring 2022 (1.606 +/- 0.832) (P = 0.89). All felt that the program improved their study skills, but fewer (40%) felt that their grades improved. Most had positive perceptions of the PA program, including self-reported improvements in health/fitness (60%), mood/mental well-being (100%), and stress management (80%). Although most improved attention when studying (80%), this did not translate to improved academic performance (40%). For the Institutional Integration Scales, only the scale for "Faculty Concern for Student Development and Teaching" improved by the end of the semester (pre: 37 +/- 7.6, post: 19 +/- 3.4, P < 0.001). Retention rate of participants (83%) was higher than the university's overall retention rate for students on academic probation (37%). By fostering social integration, improving mood and mental well-being, and increasing university retention rates this pilot project confirmed the feasibility of using upperclassmen as success coaches for a physical activity intervention for academic probation freshmen.

AB We created the "3-dimensional synaptic puzzle" (3Dsp) as an educational resource for the physiology teaching of synaptic transmission (ST). In this study, we aimed to apply and evaluate the use of 3Dsp. For this, we divided 175 university students from public and private universities into two groups: 1) control (CT; students that were only exposed to traditional class or video lessons about ST), and; 2) test (3Dsp; students that were exposed to the 3Dsp practical class in addition to the traditional theoretical class). ST knowledge of students was evaluated before, immediately after, and 15 days after interventions. Additionally, students completed a questionnaire about their perception of teaching-learning methods used in physiology classes and their self-perception of engagement in the physiology content. The CT groups improved their ST knowledge score from pretest to immediate (P < 0.0001 for all groups) and late posttest (P < 0.0001 for all groups). 3Dsp groups also enhanced their score from pretest to immediate (P = 0.029 for public university students; P < 0.0001 for private university students) and late posttest (P < 0.0001 for all groups). We also observed improvement from the immediate to late posttest in the 3Dsp group from private universities (P < 0.001). Both private groups performed better in general ST and specific electrical synapse questions in the pretest and immediate posttest compared to the public CT group (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). More than 90% of the students from both universities affirmed that the 3Dsp contributed to their physiology comprehension and that they would recommend the use of the 3-D models to other teachers in their classes.

AB The cardiovascular system must distribute oxygen and nutrients to the body while maintaining appropriate blood pressure. This is achieved through a combination of central and peripheral mechanisms that influence cardiac output and vasomotor tone throughout the vascular system. Furthermore, the capability to preferentially direct blood to tissues with increased metabolic demand (i.e., active hyperemia) is crucial to exercise tolerance. However, the interaction between these systems is difficult to understand without real-life examples. Fortunately, monitoring blood flow, blood pressure, and heart rate during a series of laboratory protocols will allow students to partition the contributions of these central and peripheral factors. The three protocols include 1) reactive hyperemia in the forearm, 2) small muscle mass handgrip exercise, and 3) large muscle mass cycling exercise. In addition to providing a detailed description of the required equipment, specific protocols, and expected outcomes, this report also reviews some of the common student misconceptions that are associated with the observed physiological responses. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Blood flow regulation during exercise is a complicated process that involves many overlapping mechanisms. This laboratory will help students better understand how the body regulates blood flow to the active muscles using three separate protocols: 1) reactive hyperemia, 2) small muscle mass exercise, and 3) large muscle mass exercise.

AB Increasingly, the curricula of many clinical programs have been restructured to an integrated model in which foundational sciences such as physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology are taught side by side with clinical reasoning. Case studies are an excellent pedagogical strategy for enhancing such integration, especially if such cases are authentic, that is, they include a broad range of information that could influence the individualization and optimization of patient care. However, authentic cases may be too advanced and thereby dissuade preclinical students. We offered an optional semester-long authentic pharmacotherapy case study to undergraduate students in an introductory pharmacology class in a liberal arts college in the United States Midwest and sought to know what might motivate students to complete this challenging task. Connection with and relevance of the case study were assessed with an anonymous survey. Open-ended questions were analyzed qualitatively. Exploratory factor analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling were employed to investigate underlying commonalities and patterns in the motivations for participating in and relating to the case study. Students were motivated more by the perceived relevance and transferability of knowledge acquired to their future career than by their current clinical technician jobs or their personal lives. Rather than causing an information overload and dissuading students, this complex pharmacotherapy case assignment harnessed preclinical students' experiences from cognate cocurricular activities, created numerous points of relevant engagement with instructional content, and therefore motivated students to deeper learning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Early introduction to clinical reasoning is widely advocated. Case studies are frequently used to enhance integration of foundational sciences with clinical reasoning. Preclinical students may be overwhelmed by complex cases because of the higher-order cognitive tasks involved. We find that complex cases permit connection with students' own experiences and aspirations. These preclinical students were motivated to engage in such challenging academic work because of the perceived transferability of knowledge to their future careers.

AB Small group learning (SGL) is a discussion-based teaching strategy that can improve critical thinking, analytical skills, problemsolving, and interpersonal skills. This study aimed to evaluate student satisfaction in two SGL models among third-year medical students enrolled in a blood and lymphoid systems II course at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 318 students were divided into 12 groups, and each group had one facilitator. All included students and groups were exposed to both the central summary (CS) model and the individual facilitator summary (IFS) model (both SGLs). A questionnaire was developed to evaluate student rating of learning activities, perceived benefit, timing, workload, and satisfaction. Medical students rated the IFS model superior to the CS model for four of five parameters [confidence in performing and interpreting a laboratory test (83.6% vs. 78.8%), guidance for self-learning (52% vs. 39.5%), increased understanding of a disease (87.7% vs. 72.1%), and application of knowledge (77.4% vs. 70.2%), respectively]. Moreover, the IFS model was rated as having more suitable timing and workload and better satisfaction than the CS model. The results of this study suggest a strong preference for the IFS model over the CS model among medical students.

AB In this paper we assessed how lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can be used to teach students the physiological effects of central hypovolemia in the absence of the LBNP and/or a medical monitor using a "dry lab" activity using LBNP data that have been previously collected. This activity was performed using published LBNP papers, with which students could explore LBNP as an important tool to study physiological responses to central hypovolemia as well as consider issues in performing an LBNP experiment and interpreting experimental results. The activity was performed at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, with 31 graduate students and 4 teachers of physiology. Both students and teachers were provided with a set of questionnaires that inquired about aspects related to the structure of the activity and how this activity integrated research and knowledge, as well as aspects related to motivation of the students and teachers to perform the activity. Our results from student and teacher surveys suggest that a "dry lab" activity using LBNP to teach physiology can be an important tool to expose students to the basics of systems physiology as well as to provide useful insights into how research is performed. Providing insight into research includes formulating a research question and then designing (including taking into account confounding variables), implementing, conducting, and interpreting research studies. Finally, developing such an activity using LBNP can also serve as a basis for developing research capacities and interests of students even early in their medical studies.

AB Anatomy and physiology courses are sometimes seen as difficult, which can lead to a lack of motivation in students to learn and engage in the course material. Students may also see the material as "dry," have issues forming personal connections, or struggle to connect the content to the real world. These issues may lead to students not performing well in the course or feeling that the health field is not ideal for them. Popular culture, especially mainstream superheroes, can serve as an option for mending these gaps by being a gateway to connecting to many students' lives. Superheroes can be integrated into the classroom through relevant, creative, and unique examples that include clinical correlates, modern scientific innovations, and some real-life "supers" living among us. Real anatomy and physiology can still be taught and explained through discussing these "incredible" examples and also present an opportunity for students to be creative in generating their own anatomical and physiological explanations for various superpowers. Superheroes also help open the classroom up to being a place of acceptance, primarily through their secret identities, which cover a broad range of idols that students can look up to, whether it is their career or based on a character's race or sexual orientation. Professors can become the superhero in their classroom and help students become more engaged and interested in the material.

AB Many national reports call for K-12 teachers to increase their content knowledge, expertise in student-centered learning methods, and skills in working with an increasingly diverse student population. Historically, most teacher professional development (PD) has not addressed these multiple challenges. We evaluated two PD models-research experiences for teachers and online PD-for their comparative impacts on middle and high school teachers' understanding of, preparedness to use, and actual use of proven STEM teaching methods and STEM career information. The programs were unique in their focus on equipping teachers with a pedagogical "tool kit" that supports ongoing changes in teaching and assessment methods, STEM content, use of technology, and working with diverse students. Findings indicate that both program models increased teachers' preparedness to use and their frequency of use of the targeted STEM teaching methods. Teachers who had summer research experiences gained additional benefits.

AB Diabetes, a chronic condition that impacts millions, is a complex disease. Understanding the disease can contribute to increasing awareness about this debilitating condition and preventing occurrences. Furthermore, inculcation of physiology knowledge may lead to an increased likelihood of career goals that align with this area of study. In pursuit of these goals, we set out to educate middle and high school students about diabetes. Thirty (16 high school; 14 middle school) students from a Sunday school program at an urban religious center completed a 10-question pretest as a way to measure initial knowledge about diabetes. Following completion of the survey, a 1-h education session was presented by a local physician who also brought a glucometer and insulin syringes for students to have a hands-on experience with some disease-specific tools. A posttest was administered following the presentation. The posttest consisted of 11 questions, where all but 2 questions were the same as for the pretest, measuring improvement of prior knowledge and engagement in the presentation. The overall posttest average score increased by approximately two correct responses, which was a significant improvement (P < 0.0001), suggesting that the students were motivated to and did learn diabetes concepts. This study also suggests that exposing students to educational activities related to physiology is beneficial and may lead to an increase in interest in physiology, an awareness of diabetes, and perhaps the development of healthy habits.

AB Poor sleep hygiene portends loss of physical and mental stamina. Therefore, maintaining a regular sleep/wake schedule on both weekdays and weekends is highly recommended. However, this advice runs contrary to the habits of university students who sleep late on weekends. Pharmacy students at Duquesne University sit for frequent examinations, typically commencing at 7:30 AM, and they complain about mental fatigue. Here, we tested the central hypothesis that longer sleep durations on both weekdays and weekends are linked to stronger academic performance in men and women. Students in their first professional year were administered three surveys to collect data on sleep habits and factors that might influence sleep, such as roommates, long commute times, and sleep interruptions. Grade point averages (GPAs) were collected from the Dean's office, with individual permissions from the students. Longer weekend-but not weekday-sleep durations were significantly correlated with higher cumulative GPAs in men and not in women. Women achieved slightly higher cumulative GPAs than men. Students who fell asleep within 15 min of going to bed had higher professional-phase GPAs than those who fell asleep after an hour or more. Our observations cannot establish causal links, but, given the body of prior evidence on the salutary properties of sleep, men may reap more benefit from recovery sleep on weekends. Rather than recommending that students force themselves awake early on weekends in an attempt to maintain a consistent sleep routine, the real-life habits of students should also be given consideration.

AB Demonstrating how science relates to human health is an important step for generating K-12 student interest in health-related careers. Science outreach is often performed in urban areas; however, similar to 20% of K-12 schools are in rural areas. Michigan Technological University is located in Michigan's upper peninsula, which accounts for 30% of the state's land mass but only 3% of the total population. Our goal was to create a science outreach program for reaching K-12 students in our rural region. We assembled a team of undergraduate and graduate students, staff, and faculty to implement science outreach with K-12 students. Specifically, we leveraged existing national and international science outreach events [Physiology Friday. Physiology Understanding (PhUn) Week, National Biomechanics Day] to offer hands-on physiology and biomechanics activities during the year. Between 2016 and 2019. we connected with 31 K-12 schools and impacted 327 elementary (19%), 351 middle school (21%), and 1,018 high school (60%) students (total impact 1,696). Over 90% of the outreach visits took place at the K-12 schools. The hands-on activities were delivered by more than 85 undergraduate and graduate students and 10 faculty. Together, the supportive culture and resources within the department (e.g., outreach coordinator, participation from students and faculty, grant funding) were key to developing the program. We recommend starting with a single outreach event, working as a team. and being flexible with K-12 schools. The program also provided service-learning and professional development opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. Our robust science outreach program promoted "PhUn" all year-round with rural K-12 students.

AB First-year Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students entering a problem-based learning (PBL) program are faced with a number of pedagogical challenges, including the development of self-directed learning skills, resource unfamiliarity, and group dynamics. These challenges can make learning anatomy in a self-directed manner less efficient. Prematriculation introduction of strategies to improve anatomy learning may help prepare students for a rigorous DPT program and improve anatomy learning efficiency. The present study describes a 2-day anatomy workshop offered to incoming students before a 1)n program was initiated. Knowledge acquired during both days of the workshop resulted in statistically significant improvements in anatomy postquiz scores for each corresponding prequiz (P < 0.001 for lower and upper limb quizzes). Workshop participants survey responses demonstrated that anatomy confidence and NI, preparedness increased at distinct intervals following the workshop and was significantly higher than controls after the first semester (P < 0.01 for anatomy confidence and PBL preparedness). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated statistically significant relationships between semester anatomy practical scores and workshop participation (P = 0.03 for practical 1 and P = 0.049 for practical 2) and undergraduate grade point average (P < 0.001 for practical 1 and P = 0.03 for practical 2). First-year DPT students reported the anatomy workshop to be a valuable experience for learning strategies to improve anatomy self-efficacy. An introductory anatomy workshop is an effective strategy to improve self-directed anatomy learning efficiency before the start of a rigorous DPT program.

ID DIFFERENTIATION
AB In this teaching laboratory, students design and perform an experiment to determine estrogen's role in imprinting the brain of neonatal rats to express either male or female sexual behavior. A discussion question is provided before the laboratory exercise in which each student is asked to search the literature and provide written answers to questions and to formulate an experiment to test the role of estrogen in imprinting the mating behavior of male and female rats. Students discuss their answers to the questions in laboratory with the instructor and design an experiment to test their hypothesis. In male rats, testosterone is converted by aromatase expressed by neurons in the brain to estrogen. Production of estrogen in the brain of neonatal rats imprints mating behavior in males, where a lack of estrogen action in the brain imprints female sexual behavior. The model involves administering exogenous testosterone to imprint male behavior in female pups or administration of an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) or an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) to imprint female sexual behavior in male pups. In the model, litters of neonatal pups are treated with either carrier (control), testosterone propionate. aromatase inhibitor (letrozole), or an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) postnatally on days 1 and 3. Alteration of mating behavior is evaluated through the numbers of males and females that breed and establish pregnancy. This is a very simple protocol that provides an excellent experiment for student discussion on the effects of hormone action on imprinting brain sexual behavior.

AB Learning clinical skills in a large group of undergraduate medical students is challenging. Innovative technology-based modalities are being evaluated to complement limited hospital rotations. We determined the effectiveness of clinical skills-related audiovisual (AV) aids embedded in electronic-problem-based learning (PBL) sessions, in terms of students' feedback and formative Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) grades. This mixed-method study was conducted during the Cardiovascular System module in year 3 of the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery program. The AV aids, mainly consisting of abnormal chest auscultation sounds, were linked to the cases for the intervention group. The control group received only a description of clinical signs. Sessions were conducted using an intranet platform. At the end of the module, feedback was obtained from intervention group students and faculty using a self-administered questionnaire. The learning was compared between intervention and control groups through an OSCE. Finally. focus group interviews were conducted to explore factors underlying deviation from the expected results. Out of 110 intervention group students, 86 (78%) responded. The students appreciated the inclusion of AV aids, as suggested by a high average satisfaction score of 4.2 (SD 0.8). They agreed that, apart from being appropriate and relevant. the aids improved the learning environment and engagement in the process. The tutors also gave a similar feedback. However, no difference in the OSCE scores was found between control and intervention groups. The study indicates that inclusion of AV aids improved students' engagement and classroom environment in electronic-PBL sessions, but did not improve diagnostic abilities based on the learned clinical skills.

AB Medical students increasingly utilize social media platforms to supplement their preclinical learning; however, the prevalence of social media use for physiology learning in medical education remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine how first-year medical students from both direct entry medicine and graduate entry medicine interacted with social media as a learning tool by assessing its prevalence, perceived benefits, favored platforms, and reason(s) for its use. Seventy-one percent of surveyed students (out of 139 participants) stated that they interacted with social media in general more than 12 times per week. However, 98% had previously used internet platforms to source physiology information, with 89.2% doing so at least once per week during term. YouTube was the primary source of learning for 76% of students. Significantly. 94% of students indicated that they would first search for answers online if they did not understand something in physiology rather than contacting their instructor in person or by e-mail. However, only 31% of students "fact-checked" physiology information obtained from online sources, by using textbooks, papers, and/or instructors. Our study has revealed that most preclinical medical students utilize social media extensively to study physiology. However, the absence of academic and ethical oversight, paired with students' lack of critical appraisal of possibly inaccurate information, does raise concerns about the overall utility of social media as part of physiology education.

AB February 11th is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. To mark this day, research centers and universities were invited by the Spanish Neuroscience Association to organize a symposium. Twenty-five centers in Spain participated in the event, with the intent of giving visibility to the existing problem of the scarcity of women compared with men in (neuro)science in positions of responsibility and command. Fourteen neuroscientists, all staff members of the University of Valencia. arranged the meeting. The morning included lectures by women neuroscientists in different phases of their career: a PhD student, a junior and a senior postdoctoral investigator, and a well-established investigator. In the evening, a roundtable composed of expert women philosophists, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) scientists, and social experts discussed why the gap exists. At the end of the meeting, the exhibition entitled, "Women in Science" commenced: pictures and a brief biography of women who made significant contributions to science were presented. More than 200 people attended the meeting, including the general public, scientists, and secondary school and university students.

AB A needs analysis study for curriculum reform in basic sciences was conducted at Melaka Manipal Medical College, India, by means of a formative assessment method, namely Basic Science Retention Examination (BSRE). Students participated in a BSRE, which comprised recall and clinical multiple-choice questions in six discipline areas. They also rated the clinical relevance of each question and provided responses to three open-text questions about the exam. Pass rates were determined; clinical relevance ratings and performance scores were compared between recall type and clinical questions to test students' level of clinical application of basic science knowledge. Text comments were thematically analyzed to identify recurring themes. Only one-third of students passed the BSRE (32.2%). Students performed better in recall questions compared with clinical questions in anatomy (51.0 vs. 40.2%), pathology (45.1 vs. 38.1%), pharmacology (41.8 vs. 31.7%), and biochemistry (43.5 vs. 26.9%). In physiology, students performed better in clinical questions compared with the recall type (56.2 vs. 45.8%). Students' response to BSRE was positive. The findings imply that transfer of basic science knowledge was poor, and that assessment methods should emphasize clinical application of basic science knowledge.

AB This review article includes our analysis of the literature and our own experiences in using various types of active learning as best practices for evidence-based teaching in physiology. We have evaluated what physiology students should be expected to learn and what are specific challenges to enhancing their learning of physiology principles. We also consider how the instructor should design his or her teaching to improve buy-in from both students and other faculty members. We include a discussion of how the readers can evaluate their teaching approaches for their successes in enhancing student learning of physiology. Thus we have addressed pedagogical improvements specific to student learning of physiology, with additional suggestions from cognitive psychology approaches that can improve physiology teaching and learning.

AB We describe a simple, cost-effective experiment to demonstrate cardiovascular integration of heart rate and blood pressure to accommodate the environmental and dietary factors of gravity and caffeine. Specific learning objectives associated with this include understanding the effects of posture on blood pressure and heart rate, coupled with the role of caffeine in modifying this response. Inclusion of ECG measurements, coupled with heart rate variability analysis, added a demonstration of the contribution made by the autonomic nervous system under these conditions. We clearly demonstrate that the cardiac work, estimated as rate-pressure product, necessary to undertake the transition from supine to standing, is fixed for a given group of subjects. However, the individual contribution of heart rate and systolic pressure to the cardiac workload is subject to the external factors of gravity and caffeine. Such an activity also demonstrates additional benefits, including unstructured teaching opportunities to augment classroom learning associated with integrative physiology and also the discussion of ethical issues with regard to human experimentation.

AB Physiology is a requisite course for many professional allied health programs and is a foundational science for learning pathophysiology, health assessment, and pharmacology. Given the demand for online learning in the health sciences, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of online and in-class teaching methods, especially as they are combined to form hybrid courses. The purpose of this study was to compare two hybrid physiology sections in which one section was offered mostly in-class (85% in-class), and the other section was offered mostly online (85% online). The two sections in 2 yr (year 1 and year 2) were compared in terms of knowledge of physiology measured in exam scores and pretest-posttest improvement, and in measures of student satisfaction with teaching. In year 1, there were some differences on individual exam scores between the two sections, but no significant differences in mean exam scores or in pretest-posttest improvements. However, in terms of student satisfaction, the mostly in-class students in year 1 rated the instructor significantly higher than did the mostly online students. Comparisons between in-class and online students in the year 2 cohort yielded data that showed that mean exam scores were not statistically different, but pre-post changes were significantly greater in the mostly online section; student satisfaction among mostly online students also improved significantly. Education researchers must investigate effective combinations of in-class and online methods for student learning outcomes, while maintaining the flexibility and convenience that online methods provide.

AB The purpose of the present study was to assess the current status of physiology education in US Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) programs. A survey instrument was developed and distributed through SurveyMonkey to American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Biological Sciences section members of 132 PharmD programs. Survey items focused on soliciting qualitative and quantitative information on the delivery of physiology curricular contents and faculty perceptions of physiology education. A total of 114 programs responded to the survey, resulting in a response rate of 86%. Out of 114 schools/colleges, 61 programs (54%) offered standalone physiology courses, and 53 programs (46%) offered physiology integrated with other courses. When integrated, the average contact hours for physiology contents were significantly reduced compared with standalone courses (30 vs. 84 h, P < 0.0001). Survey respondents identified diverse strategies in the delivery and assessment of physiology contents. Eighty percent of the responding faculty (n = 204) agree/strongly agree that physiology is underemphasized in PharmD curriculum. Moreover, 67% of the respondents agree/strongly agree that physiology should be taught as a standalone foundational course. A wide variation in the depth and breadth of physiology course offerings in US PharmD programs remains. The reduction of physiology contents is evident when physiology is taught as a component of integrated courses. Given current trends that favor integrated curricula, these data suggest that additional collaboration among basic and clinical science faculty is required to ensure that physiology contents are balanced and not underemphasized in a PharmD curriculum.

ID MISCONCEPTIONS
AB The present study explored the nature and frequency of physiology naive beliefs by investigating novices' understanding of the respiratory system. Previous studies have shown considerable misconceptions related to physiology but focused mostly on specific physiological processes of normal respiration. Little is known about novices' broader understanding of breathing in a clinical context. Our study hypothesized that naive beliefs could hamper participants' ability to understand the interrelatedness of respiratory structures and functions related to breathing during a clinical complication. The study entailed both quantitative and qualitative foci. A two-tier test was designed and administered to 211 first-year medical students. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer out of a set of four options and to substantiate their choices. Questions were purposefully left open to elicit a wide range of responses. Statistical analysis (SPSS) was done to evaluate the frequency of naive beliefs. Thematic analysis was used to determine themes within the raw data. The majority of participants selected incorrect answers in the multiple-choice question part of the questionnaire. Results from the thematic analysis yielded a considerable range of naive beliefs about gas exchange, foundational physics, airflow, anatomic structures, and breathing pathways. An awareness of the existence of such naive beliefs in respiratory physiology will allow educators to address them in their teaching and thereby prevent naive beliefs transforming into misconceptions.

ID PULMONARY-CIRCULATION
AB During the last century, historians have discovered that between the 13th and 18th centuries, at least six sages discovered that the air we breathe contains something that we need and use. Ibn al-Nafis (1213-1288) in Cairo and Michael Servetus (1511-1553) in France accurately described the pulmonary circulation and its effect on blood color. Michael Sendivogius (1566-1636) in Poland called a part of air "the food of life" and identified it as the gas made by heating saltpetre. John Mayow (1641-1679) in Oxford found that one-fifth of air was a special gas he called "spiritus nitro aereus." Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1742-1786) in Uppsala generated a gas he named "fire air" by heating several metal calcs. He asked Lavoisier how it fit the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier never answered. In 1744, Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in England discovered how to make part of air by heating red calc of mercury. He found it brightened a flame and supported life in a mouse in a sealed bottle. He called it "dephlogisticated air." He published and personally told Lavoisier and other chemists about it. Lavoisier never thanked him. After 9 years of generating and studying its chemistry, he couldn't understand whether it was a new element. He still named it "principe oxigene." He was still not able to disprove phlogiston. Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) made an inflammable gas in 1766. He and Priestley noted that its flame made a dew. Cavendish proved the dew was pure water and published this in 1778, but all scientists called it impossible to make water, an element. In 1783, on June 24th, Lavoisier was urged to try it, and, when water appeared, he realized that water was not an element but a compound of two gases, proving that oxygen was an element. He then demolished phlogiston and began the new chemistry revolution.

AB From a Cartesian perspective of rational analysis, the electric potential difference across the cell membrane is one of the fundamental concepts for the study of physiology. Unfortunately, undergraduate students often struggle to understand the genesis of this energy gradient, which makes the teaching activity a hard task for the instructor. The topic of bioelectrogenesis encompasses multidisciplinary concepts, involves several mechanisms, and is a dynamic process, i.e., it never turns off during the lifetime of the cell. Therefore, to improve the transmission and acquisition of knowledge in this field, I present an alternative didactic model. The design of the model assumes that it is possible to build, in a series of sequential steps, an assembly of proteins within the membrane of an isolated cell in a simulated electrophysiology experiment. Initially, no proteins are inserted in the membrane and the cell is at a baseline energy state; the extracellular and intracellular fluids are at thermodynamic equilibrium. Students are guided through a sequence of four steps that add key membrane transport proteins to the model cell. The model is simple at the start and becomes progressively more complex, finally producing transmembrane chemical and electrical gradients. I believe that this didactic approach helps instructors with a more efficient tool for the teaching of the mechanisms of resting membrane potential while helping students avoid common difficulties that may be encountered when learning this topic.

AB Thermoregulation is the maintenance of a relatively constant core body temperature. Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37 degrees C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival. This concept is so important that control of thermoregulation is often the principal example cited when teaching physiological homeostasis. A basic understanding of the processes underpinning temperature regulation is necessary for all undergraduate students studying biology and biology-related disciplines, and a thorough understanding is necessary for those students in clinical training. Our aim in this review is to broadly present the thermoregulatory process taking into account current advances in this area. First, we summarize the basic concepts of thermoregulation and subsequently assess the physiological responses to heat and cold stress, including vasodilation and vasoconstriction, sweating, nonshivering thermogenesis, piloerection, shivering, and altered behavior. Current research is presented concerning the body's detection of thermal challenge, peripheral and central thermoregulatory control mechanisms, including brown adipose tissue in adult humans and temperature transduction by the relatively recently discovered transient receptor potential channels. Finally, we present an updated understanding of the neuroanatomic circuitry supporting thermoregulation.

AB Diffusion is critical to physiological processes ranging from gas exchange across alveoli to transport within individual cells. In the classroom, however, it can be challenging to convey the concept of diffusion on the microscopic scale. In this article, we present a series of three exercises that use food and cooking to illustrate diffusion theory and Fick's first law. These exercises are part of a 10-wk undergraduate course that uses food and cooking to teach fundamental concepts in physiology and biophysics to students, including nonscience majors. Consistent demonstration of practical applications in a classroom setting has the potential to fundamentally change how students view the role of science in their lives (15).

AB The Read CO2 rebreathing method (Read DJ. A clinical method for assessing the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. Australas Ann Med 16: 20-32, 1967) provides a simple and reproducible approach for studying the chemical control of breathing. It has been widely used since the modifications made by Duffin and coworkers. Our use of a rebreathing laboratory to challenge undergraduate science students to investigate the control of breathing provided 8 yr of student-generated data for comparison with the literature. Students (age: 19-22 yr, Research Ethics Board approval) rebreathed from a bag containing 5% CO2 and 95% O-2 (to suppress the peripheral chemoreflex to hypoxia). Rebreathing was performed, and ventilation measured, after hyperventilation to deplete tissue CO2 stores and enable the detection of the central chemoreflex threshold. We analyzed 43 data sets, of which 10 were rejected for technical reasons. The mean threshold and ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 were 43.3 +/- 3.8 mmHg and 4.60 +/- 3.04 l.min(-1).mmHg(-1) (means +/- SD), respectively. Threshold values were normally distributed, whereas sensitivity was skewed to the left. Both mean values agreed well with those in the literature. We conclude that the modified rebreathing protocol is a robust method for undergraduate investigation of the chemical control of breathing.

Adv Physiol Educ 36: 302-306, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00093.2012.Active learning, "learning by doing," enhances student performance on examinations and improves student retention of course content. Active learning also provides inquiry-based, collaborative, and problem-solving activities that promote curiosity, skepticism, objectivity, and the use of scientific reasoning. To incorporate active learning into our undergraduate anatomy and physiology course of 70 nursing students, students constructed working physical models of skeletal muscle during the scheduled class time. Our goals were to actively engage students in the process of building and testing their own mental models from the information they were acquiring. During the process, the focus was on the student acquiring knowledge, thinking about the information, testing assumptions, solving problems, and appreciating the joy, excitement, and love for learning. We conclude that the construction of physical models during class is a valuable educational experience.

AB Abraham RR, Fisher M, Kamath A, Izzati TA, Nabila S, Atikah NN. Exploring first-year undergraduate medical students' self-directed learning readiness to physiology. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 393-395, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00011.2011.-Medical students are expected to possess self-directed learning skills to pursue lifelong learning. Previous studies have reported that the readiness for self-directed learning depends on personal attributes as well as the curriculum followed in institutions. Melaka Manipal Medical College of Manipal University (Karnataka, India) offers a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) twinning program that is of 5 yr in duration. Keeping in mind the amount of time that the curriculum has devoted for self-directed learning, we explored the self-directed learning readiness of first-year MBBS students (n = 130) using a self-directed learning readiness scale (SDLRS) and explored the correlation between SDLRS scores of high achievers, medium achievers, and low achievers with their academic performance in physiology examinations. Students were requested to respond to each item of the SDLRS on a Likert scale. Median scores of the three scales of the SDLRS were compared across the three groups of students using a Kruskall-Wallis test. SDLRS scores of the students (n = 130) were correlated with their marks in theory papers of first, second, and third block-end examinations using Spearmann's correlation coefficient. The mean item score for desire for learning was found to be higher followed by self-control and self-management. Data analyses showed significantly high (P < 0.03) median scores for self-control for high achievers compared with medium and low achievers. Between the groups, high achievers had a higher score for all the three scales of the SDLRS followed by low and medium achievers. SDLRS scores and academic performance of the three groups of students were found to exhibit a weak correlation. This study threw light on the fact that despite having a high desire for learning and ability of self-control, students need to be supported in their self-management skills.

AB Kibble JD, Johnson T. Are faculty predictions or item taxonomies useful for estimating the outcome of multiple-choice examinations? Adv Physiol Educ 35: 396-401, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00062.2011.-The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether multiple-choice item difficulty could be predicted either by a subjective judgment by the question author or by applying a learning taxonomy to the items. Eight physiology faculty members teaching an upper-level undergraduate human physiology course consented to participate in the study. The faculty members annotated questions before exams with the descriptors "easy," " moderate," or "hard" and classified them according to whether they tested knowledge, comprehension, or application. Overall analysis showed a statistically significant, but relatively low, correlation between the intended item difficulty and actual student scores (rho = -0.19, P < 0.01), indicating that, as intended item difficulty increased, the resulting student scores on items tended to decrease. Although this expected inverse relationship was detected, faculty members were correct only 48% of the time when estimating difficulty. There was also significant individual variation among faculty members in the ability to predict item difficulty (chi(2) = 16.84, P = 0.02). With regard to the cognitive level of items, no significant correlation was found between the item cognitive level and either actual student scores (rho = -0.09, P = 0.14) or item discrimination (rho = 0.05, P = 0.42). Despite the inability of faculty members to accurately predict item difficulty, the examinations were of high quality, as evidenced by reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) of 0.70-0.92, the rejection of only 4 of 300 items in the postexamination review, and a mean item discrimination (point biserial) of 0.37. In conclusion, the effort of assigning annotations describing intended difficulty and cognitive levels to multiple-choice items is of doubtful value in terms of controlling examination difficulty. However, we also report that the process of annotating questions may enhance examination validity and can reveal aspects of the hidden curriculum.

AB Henige K. Undergraduate student attitudes and perceptions toward low-and high-level inquiry exercise physiology teaching laboratory experiences. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 197-205, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00086.2010.-The purpose of this investigation was to compare student attitudes toward two different science laboratory learning experiences, specifically, traditional, cook-book-style, low-inquiry level (LL) activities and a high-inquiry level (HL) investigative project. In addition, we sought to measure and compare students' science-related attitudes and attitudes toward science. Students participated in 5 wk of LL activities followed by a 5-wk HL project. An open-ended survey administered at the end of the semester and analyzed by a chi(2)-test revealed that 1) students enjoyed the HL project more than the LL activities, 2) high-level inquiry did not have a negative effect on student motivation in the laboratory, and 3) students perceived that they learned more about physiology principles with the LL activities. Most students liked the HL project, particularly the independence, responsibility, freedom, and personal relevance. Of the students who did not like the HL project, many reported being uncomfortable with the lack of structure and guidance. Many students gained a more positive and realistic view about scientific research, often reporting an increased respect for science. Likert scale surveys administered before and after each 5-wk period showed no significant changes in student attitudes to scientific inquiry, adoption of scientific attitudes, enjoyment of science lessons, or motivation toward science when the three time points were compared. The findings in this study have helped to provide suggestions for better implementation of HL projects in the future.

ID PHYSIOLOGY
AB Mass balance (MB) reasoning offers a rich topic for examination of students' scientific thinking and skills, as it requires students to account for multiple inputs and outputs within a system and apply covariational reasoning. Using previously validated constructed response prompts for MB, we examined 1,920 student-constructed responses (CRs) aligned to an emerging learning progression to determine how student language changes from low (1) to high (4) covariational reasoning levels. As students' abilities and thinking change with Context, we used the same general prompt in six physiological contexts. We asked how Level and Context affect student language and what language is conserved across Contexts at higher reasoning Levels. Using diversity methods, we found student language becomes more similar as covariational reasoning level increases. Using text analysis, we found context-dependent words at each Level; however, the type of context words changed. Specifically, at Level 1, students used context words that are tangential to MB reasoning, while Level 4 responses used words that specify inputs and outputs for the given Item Context. Further, at Level 4, students shared 30% of language across the six contexts and leveraged context-independent words including rate, equal, and some form of slower/lower/smaller. Together, these data demonstrate that Context affects undergraduate MB language at all covariational reasoning levels, but that the language becomes more specific and similar as Level increases. These findings encourage instructors to foster context-independent, comparative, and summative language during instruction to functionally build MB and covariational reasoning skills across contexts.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

AB Conventional teaching about obesity, especially within a physiology-based course, tends to focus on the biological aspects. Unfortunately, framing obesity from a solely biological perspective ignores many factors that contribute to the condition, leaving students with an overly simplistic idea. We developed an introductory exercise physiology course that was cotaught with a physiologist and a sociologist to provide health science majors with a more holistic view of complex socioscientific issues including obesity. From our course, students self-reported changes in their views about obesity and exercise to include more empathy as well as nuance regarding exercise and body size as physiological and biological processes that are experienced and take place socioculturally. We found value in this cross-disciplinary approach and recommend it as a frame for other exercise physiology courses; we recognize this is not always possible, so we also provide resources for faculty who do not have a sociologist to coteach with. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article presents a unique perspective on the necessity of including sociological concepts and teaching alongside certain topics within a physiology classroom along with some resources for faculty wishing to engage in similar infusions of sociological thinking.

AB Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling requires an understanding of chemical, physiologic, and pharmacokinetic principles. Active learning with PBPK modeling software (GastroPlus) may be useful to teach these scientific principles while also teaching software operation. To examine this issue, a graduate-level course was designed using learning objectives in science, software use, and PBPK model application. These objectives were taught through hands-on PBPK modeling to answer clinically relevant questions. Students demonstrated proficient use of software, based on their responses to these questions, and showed an improved understanding of scientific principles on a pre- and post-course assessment. These outcomes support the effectiveness of simultaneous teaching of interdependent software and science.

AB Internodal conduction pathways are the communication apparatus of the cardiac conduction system conveying sinus node action potentials (APs) to the atrioventricular node and atrial working myocytes. In 1910, at the Deutschen Pathologischen Gesellschaft held in Erlangen, Charles Thorel related his discovery of an internodal bundle structured with Purkinje-like cells, which was rejected by the participants, who endorsed the then-leading doctrine that atrial contractile cardiomyocytes operate as internodal routes. Starting in 1963 and for five subsequent decades, two groups have revisited this issue. The first group, led by Thomas James, defended the histological existence of uninsulated, high-speed cordlike internodal conduction tracts. Although not supported by robust experimental data, this hypothesis achieved the status of a physiological creed in the scientific community. The second group, led by Robert Anderson, systematically refuted this stance and adopted anisotropy as an innovative internodal conduction mechanism operating via spindle-shaped atrial contractile myocytes structured in anisotropic muscular bundles relaying sinoatrial node (SAN) APs to their atrial destinations at physiologically required (fit for purpose) velocities to enable electromechanical synchrony of atrial systoles. Modern imaging and electrophysiological techniques can now clearly visualize muscular internodal and interatrial tracts and SAN depolarization electrical waves, confirming the existence of atrial conduction paths consisting of anisotropically arranged contractile cardiomyocytes. Mastery of the current best-science anatomy and physiology of the human atria is required for electrophysiologists to safely perform atrial radiofrequency ablation interventions to restore sinus rhythm in patients distressed by supraventricular arrhythmias.

AB A well-developed mental model is crucial for effectively studying physiology core concepts. However, mental models can be difficult for students to represent and for instructors to evaluate and correct. Systems modeling as a visualization cognitive tool may facilitate mental model development. On the other hand, evidence of mental model development may also be represented verbally, in writing, and therefore, be evaluated. In this study, analysis of writing prompt completions illustrated progress in physician assistant student mental model formation of physiology core concepts, such as homeostasis and cell-cell communication, over time. Two cohorts of physician assistant students were invited to voluntarily submit completions of writing prompts five times over 16 months. Sessions included submissions pre- and post-small group systems modeling participation. Word frequency and word association cluster dendrogram analyses were conducted on submissions using the tm text mining package in R to provide insight into progressive changes in core concepts of word use and associations. Students demonstrated expanded core concepts systems thinking over time. This was apparent through the increased use of systems process terms, such as homeostasis, in submissions immediately following systems modeling activities. Students also increasingly included terms and associations emphasizing cell-cell communication and systems integration. The inclusion of these concepts within student mental models was demonstrably enhanced by participation in systems modeling activities.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study applies text mining, an artificial intelligence form of natural language processing, to evaluate a series of physiology student-written prompt completions. Text mining of student writing in physiology has not yet been reported in the literature. Through the application of this technique, longitudinal trends in student development of mental models of core concepts were identified and visualized through word frequency distributions and cluster dendrograms.

ID REFLECTIONS; FACULTY
AB An Australia-wide consensus was reached on seven core concepts of physiology, one of which was "structure and function" with the descriptor "Structure and function are intrinsically related to all levels of the organism. In all physiological systems, the structure from a microscopic level to an organ level dictates its function." As a framework for the structure and function core concept, the renal system was unpacked by a team of 5 Australian Physiology educators from different universities with extensive teaching experience into hierarchical levels, with 5 themes and 25 subthemes up to 3 levels deep. Within theme 1, the structures that comprise the renal system were unpacked. Within theme 2, the physiological processes within the nephron such as filtration, reabsorption, and secretion were unpacked. Within theme 3, the processes involved in micturition were unpacked. In theme 4, the structures and processes involved in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration were unpacked; and within theme 5, the role of the kidney in red blood cell production was unpacked. Twenty-one academics rated the difficulty and importance of each theme/subtheme, and results were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. All identified themes were validated as "essential" to "important"/"moderately important" and rated between "difficult" to "not difficult." A similar framework consisting of structure, physiological processes, physical processes, and regulation can be used to unpack other body systems. Unpacking of the body systems will provide a list of what students should be taught in curricula across Australian universities and inform assessment and learning activities. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first attempt to unpack and validate the "structure and function" core concept in physiology with all Australian educators. We unpacked the renal system into themes with hierarchical levels, which were validated by an experienced team of Australian physiology educators. Our unpacking of the "structure and function" core concept provides a specific framework for educators to apply this important concept in physiology education.

AB Patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity require a large amount of space and equipment. The technique is difficult to master and not conducive to demonstration to more than a few medical students. Therefore, neurophysiological education is mostly limited to classroom-based pedagogies such as lectures. However, the demonstration of concepts such as changes in membrane potential and ion channel activity is best achieved with hands-on approaches. This article details an in silico activity suitable for large groups of medical students that demonstrates the key concepts in neurophysiology using the LabAXON simulation software. Learning activities in our practical include 1) measurements of voltage and time parameters of the neuronal action potential and its relationship to the Nernst potentials of Na (+) and K+; 2) determination of the stimulus threshold to evoke action potentials; 3) demonstration of the refractory period of an action potential; and 4) voltage-clamp experiments to determine the current-voltage relationship of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels and the voltage dependence of, and recovery from, inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels. We emphasized the accuracy of quantitative measurements as well as the correct use of units. The level of difficulty of the activity can be altered through different multiple choice questions relating to material introduced in the associated lectures. This practical activity is suitable for different class sizes and is adaptable for delivery with online platforms. Student feedback showed that the students felt the activity helped them consolidate their understanding of the lecture material.

ID PROGRAM
AB Guided reflective narratives facilitate deeper understanding and learning. The study was aimed at exploring the scope of guided reflective narratives on early clinical exposure, for first-year medical students, in promoting empathy. Strengths and limitations of the process of reflective narratives were also explored. First-year medical students (n = 150) were exposed to guided reflective narrative writing following each of the three "early clinical exposure" sessions integrated into a physiology curriculum. A feedback on the entire program was obtained through a semistructured questionnaire. The contents of the reflective narratives and feedback on the program were analyzed. Students empathized with the situation and needs of patients and caregivers and could relate to responsibilities and challenges faced by members of health care team. They realized the importance of cooperation from patients and caregivers and work efficiency, communication, behavior, and teamwork from members of healthcare and thereby emerged with the idea of the coordinated effort in patient care. Students opined that reflective narratives made them reflect and empathize with people and situations. Too many narrative writing sessions and hesitation to share their thoughts were some of the suggested limitations. The process led to emergence of a working model for guided reflections to promote empathy. Guided reflective narratives made students reflect and relate to people and situations. While promoting empathy, the reflections also gave them an idea of holistic approach to patient-centered care. Inferences led to a conceptual model for guided reflections to promote empathy among medical students.

AB This paper describes how an anatomy and physiology laboratory class transitioned from a paper-based lab to an online learning platform that updated the curriculum to rely more on face-to-face small group collaboration and peer teaching. Student perceptions of the new format were positive, but halfway through the transition a global pandemic challenged the new instruction method. The face-to-face curriculum had to be adjusted to a virtual format that lacked in-person interaction between the instructor and the students. This switch to virtual labs had an adverse effect on both student perception and student performance in the second half of the semester. Our observations underscore the importance of creating an interactive community when teaching virtually.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

ID EDUCATION; ARTS
AB Learning physiology is challenging for students. The nature of the discipline, which includes many complex mechanisms, makes the subject complicated. Furthermore, the length of the textbooks and the usual multiple-choice tests, which prioritize memorizing instead of understanding, tend to discourage the students. Therefore, different pedagogical strategies have been adopted to motivate and facilitate the learning of physiology. In this sense, many pedagogical strategies have been using art as a tool to motivate and induce students to self-learn. Besides, art as a pedagogical tool has also been shown to be important in developing self-assurance, self-pride, as well as the development of critical-thinking skills in the students. Here, we incorporate a new practice of self-directed teaching and learning, which involves artwork interpretation in a physiological context. This extra- classroom activity integrating art and physiology (The PhysioArt Project) improved students'engagement, increasing their interest in the discipline by providing a more creative, pleasurable, and enthusiastic atmosphere for enjoying and learning physiology, which also has contributed to the development of creativity, critical thinking, and students' self-assurance. Interestingly, the benefits elicited by The PhysioArt Project activities have also helped us to enhance the student-professor relationship, inducing a more humanized education.

ID IMPACT
AB The search for more efficient teaching methodologies is a great challenge for Brazilian educators, since most classes are still traditional (theoretical) and have little student involvement during the learning process. Active learning methodologies, where students play a central role in the learning process, are proving to be more effective and interesting when it comes to acquiring knowledge. Thus we decided to develop an innovative technique for teaching Human Endocrine Physiology, called "Endocrine Circuit." The circuit consisted of eight stations in which students were asked to organize a scheme with cards to answer a specific question about a gland or tissue with endocrine relevance. The effectiveness of the developed activity was validated through a pretest-posttest design, in which the students had to answer a 10-question test. We found out that, after the Endocrine Circuit application, students showed an improvement in the percentage of correct answers for 7 out of 10 questions contained in the questionnaire (P <= 0.05). In addition, the activity showed positive outcomes regarding student's engagement in this study, besides showing to be more efficient than the Brazilian traditional theoretical classes.

AB Developing hands-on activities that engage and excite K-12 students is critical for stimulating interest in science-based careers. We created an activity for high school students that required them to integrate biology and physics concepts to experience how humans and animals maneuver through their environments (i.e., turning). Understanding how turning works is important because it accounts for up to 50% of daily walking steps and is needed for survival when animals elude predators and capture prey. For this activity, student groups used 2 x 4 lumber, wood screws, and a power drill to build an apparatus that, when connected to the body, altered rotational inertia (object's resistance to change in angular motion, I = mass x radius(2)). Students navigated through a slalom course with the apparatus (increased radius and rotational inertia) and without the apparatus (mass-matched control). Times to complete the course were compared between trials to determine the influence of rotational inertia on turning performance. Students compiled their data, graphed their results, and found that increased rotational inertia decreased turning performance. Results were connected to sports. rehabilitation, and dinosaur evolution. This activity was implemented during local, regional, national, and international outreach events and adapted for use in undergraduate courses as well (total impact, 250 students). At the end of the activity, students were able to 1) describe whether their results supported their hypothesis; 2) explain how radius influences rotational inertia and turning performance; and 3) apply results to real-world examples. Students and teachers appreciated this "outside-the-box" activity with an engineering twist and found it entertaining.

AB Pharmacy school applications have steadily declined over the past several years. Thus pharmacy schools are not only searching for effective means to increase enrollment of qualified candidates, but arc also focusing on the development of programs to improve academic performance and retention of enrolled students. To address the needs of struggling first-year pharmacy students enrolled in an Integrated Biological Sciences (BSI) course, an academic performance enrichment program (APEP) was developed. The program was designed to improve academic success by engaging low-performing students with the aims of improving their time management skills, study skills. metacognition, and understanding of BSI course material. The APEP consisted of structured tutoring sessions twice per week, which were required for all students with a course grade <= 73.5% at any point during the semester. To assess program effectiveness, performance improvement on BSI exams by the APEP students were compared with that of non-APEP students in the same class and to those in the previous 3 yr. Student perceptions of the program were also evaluated via an online survey. The APEP was deemed effective in that a greater percentage of students were able to improve their exam scores and to a greater extent by attending the APEP sessions compared with non-APEP students in the same class and with low-performing students in previous years when the APEP did not exist. Furthermore, APEP students believed the program was effective in meeting its aims. In conclusion, the APEP was effective in improving academic performance of low-performing students in BSI.

In humans, muscle metaboreflex activation can be isolated via postexercise ischemia (PEI). which increases sympathetic nerve activity and partially maintains the exercise-induced increase in arterial blood pressure. Here, we describe a practical laboratory class using PEI as a simple and useful technique to teach cardiovascular physiology. In an undergraduate exercise physiology class (n = 47), a traditional 4-h lecture was conducted discussing the neural control mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation during exercise. Thereafter, eight students (4 men and 4 women) were selected to participate as a volunteer of a practical laboratory class. Each participant performed 90 s of isometric handgrip exercise at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction, followed by 3 min of PEI. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured by digital monitors at rest and during isometric handgrip, PEI, and recovery. In addition, blood samples were collected from the tip of the exercising finger for blood lactate analyses. After the laboratory class, a survey was given to determine the perceptions of the students. The findings demonstrate that this laboratory class has proved to be highly popular with students, who self-reported a significant improvement in their understanding of several aspects of cardiovascular regulation during exercise.

AB Laboratory practical programs are expected to fulfill many roles in the learning process, including the development of laboratory skills and problem-solving skills. However, little is known about the role of laboratory practical classes in the conceptual learning of physiology. Therefore, the main aims of this study were to identify some of the threshold concepts in physiology and to explore the role of our laboratory practical program in helping students to tackle these concepts. An online questionnaire gathered opinions from students on the value of the laboratory classes in helping them to learn. Interviews with students and with lecturers were performed to ascertain which concepts students find particularly difficult, why they find these concepts difficult, and what their opinions are on the role of the laboratory practical classes in helping students to grasp difficult concepts. A number of threshold concepts in physiology were identified, and some possible reasons underlying the difficulties were explored. Overall, the majority of respondents found that the laboratory practical program helped them to learn physiology. While the laboratory classes were found to promote conceptual learning in a number of ways, a prominent finding was that the laboratory classes help students to grasp the theory because they allow students to visually see the physiological events, they bring the theory to life, and they allow students to experience some applications of the theory. The study also highlighted areas for further development in relation to the promotion of conceptual learning within the teaching laboratory.

AB We developed an experiment to help students understand basic regulation of postabsorptive and postprandial glucose metabolism and the availability of energy sources for physical activity in the fed and fasted state. Within a practical session, teams of two or three students (1 subject and 1 or 2 investigators) performed one of three different trials: 1) inactive, in which subjects ingested a glucose solution (75 g in 300 ml of water) and rested in the seated position until the end of the trial; 2) prior activity, in which the subject performed 15 min of walking before glucose ingestion and a subsequent resting phase; and 3) postactivity, in which the subject ingested glucose solution, walked (15 min), and rested afterwards. Glucose levels were drawn before trials (fasting value), immediately after glucose ingestion (0 min), and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min thereafter. Students analyzed glucose values and worked on 12 tasks. Students evaluated the usefulness of the experiment; 54.2% of students found the experiment useful to enable them to gain a further understanding of the learning objectives and to clarify items, and 44.1% indicated that the experiment was necessary to enable them to understand the learning objectives. For 6.8% the experiment was not necessary but helpful to check what they had learned, and 3.4% found that the experiment was not necessary. The present article shows the great value of experiments within practical courses to help students gain knowledge of energy metabolism. Using an active learning strategy, students outworked complex physiological tasks and improved beneficial communication and interaction between students with different skill sets and problem-solving strategies.

AB Open educational resources (OERs) are becoming increasingly common as a tool in education, particularly in medical and biomedical education. However, three key barriers have been identified to their use: 1) lack of awareness of OERs, 2) lack of motivation to use OERs, and 3) lack of training in the use of OERs. Here, we explore these three barriers with teachers of medical and biomedical science to establish how best to enhance the use of OERs to improve pedagogical outcomes. An online survey was completed by 209 educators, many of whom (68.4%) reported using OERs in their teaching and almost all (99.5%) showing awareness of at least one OER. The results suggest that key problems that prevent educators from adopting OERs in their teaching include suitability for particular classes, time, and copyright. Most (81.8%) educators were somewhat, very, or extremely comfortable with OERs so there is no innate motivational barrier to adoption. A lack of training was reported by 13.9% of respondents, and 40% of respondents stated that there was little or no support from their institutions. OER users were no more comfortable with technology or better supported by departments but tended to be aware of a greater number of sources of OERs. Our study illustrates key opportunities for the expansion of OER use in physiology and medical teaching: increased breadth of awareness, increased institutional support (including time, training, and copyright support), and greater sharing of diverse OERs to suit the range of teaching challenges faced by staff in different subdisciplines.

AB A cohort of first-year biology students was surveyed regarding their opinions and viewing habits for live and recorded lectures. Most respondents (87%) attended live lectures as a rule (attenders), with 66% attending more than two-thirds of the lectures. In contrast, only 52% accessed recordings and only 13% viewed more than two-thirds of the available recordings. Respondents regarded lectures as efficient for information delivery (75%), and 89% enjoyed live lectures because they were useful for learning (89%), understanding coursework (94%), and keeping up with the subject (93%). Lecture enjoyment was driven less by entertainment (34%) or interaction with the lecturers (47%), although most students preferred an entertaining lecturer to a factual expert (72%). Exam marks were positively correlated with the number of lectures attended (P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the number of recordings viewed (P < 0.05), although marks were similar for lecture attenders and nonattenders (P < 0.05). Lecture attenders mostly missed lectures to complete assessments during the same week (68%), whereas nonattenders were more likely to miss lectures due to outside commitments or preference for study from books or recorded lectures (P < 0.001). Recordings were used to replace missed lectures (64%), rather than for revision, and were viewed mostly alone (96%) in one sitting (65%). Only 22% of respondents agreed that some lectures could be replaced by recordings, but 59% agreed with having some videoconference lectures from experts on another campus. Overall, this cohort showed a clear preference for live lectures over recordings, with limited support for synchronous videoconference lectures.

ID STUDENT PERFORMANCE; BENEFITS
AB The aims of the present study were to measure the effects of individual answer (correct vs. incorrect), individual answer of group members (no vs. some vs. all correct), self-confidence about the responses (low vs. mid vs. high), sex (female vs. male students), and group size (2-4 students) on the odds for change and for correctness after peer instruction in a veterinary physiology course (n = 101 students). Data were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The likelihood for change after peer instruction increased when the confidence on an individual answer was low (P < 0.01), when the answer was incorrect (P < 0.01), and when group members had different responses (P < 0.01). The likelihood for correctness after peer instruction increased when the confidence in group answers was high (P < 0.01), when the individual answer was correct (P < 0.01), and when at least one of the group members had the correct response (P < 0.01). After peer discussion, more changes were from incorrect to correct responses than vice versa (72% vs. 28%, P < 0.01). Changes to correct answers occurred after discussion with peers having both the correct individual response (76% of times) and also the incorrect individual answer (24% of times). In conclusion, the benefits of peer instruction are due to students having correct answers generally prevail in discussions. Also, students who all have incorrect answers can get the correct answer through debate and discussion.

AB The physiology of breath holding is complex, and voluntary breath-hold duration is affected by many factors, including practice, psychology, respiratory chemoreflexes, and lung stretch. In this activity, we outline a number of simple laboratory activities or classroom demonstrations that illustrate the complexity of the integrative physiology behind breath-hold duration. These activities require minimal equipment and are easily adapted to small-group demonstrations or a larger-group inquiry format where students can design a protocol and collect and analyze data from their classmates. Specifically, breath-hold duration is measured during a number of maneuvers, including after end expiration, end inspiration, voluntary prior hyperventilation, and inspired hyperoxia. Further activities illustrate the potential contribution of chemoreflexes through rebreathing and repeated rebreathing after a maximum breath hold. The outcome measures resulting from each intervention are easily visualized and plotted and can comprise a comprehensive data set to illustrate and discuss complex and integrated cardiorespiratory physiology.

AB Exercise is a well-established tool to prevent and combat type 2 diabetes. Exercise improves whole body metabolic health in people with type 2 diabetes, and adaptations to skeletal muscle are essential for this improvement. An acute bout of exercise increases skeletal muscle glucose uptake, while chronic exercise training improves mitochondrial function, increases mitochondrial biogenesis, and increases the expression of glucose transporter proteins and numerous metabolic genes. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of exercise to increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.

ID AUGUST KROGH; PRINCIPLE; BIOLOGY
AB The medieval simile of the world as a book seems to anticipate modern notions of biodiversity as a key to insights and learning. This thought is translated into the practice of research in the August Krogh principle, which provides argumentative support for researchers who dare to venture beyond the range of commonly used models by choosing a new experimental organism for a particular scientific question. Established model organisms often hold high exploratory power to the researcher yet little explanatory power to the student, in particular when represented in a secondary source. This essay puts forward the suggestion that Krogh's principle applies to the use of organisms as instructional models and textbook examples too and encourages educators to continuously venture beyond established illustrative teaching examples in a continuous exploration of the "book of the world" and the "treasure house of nature."

AB Optimizing the usability of e-learning materials is necessary to reduce extraneous cognitive load and maximize their potential educational impact. However, this is often neglected, especially when time and other resources are limited. We conducted a randomized trial to investigate whether a usability evaluation of our multimedia e-learning resource, followed by fixing of all problems identified, would translate into improvements in usability parameters and learning by medical residents. Two iterations of our e-learning resource [version 1 (V1) and version 2 (V2)] were compared. V1 was the first fully functional version and V2 was the revised version after all identified usability problems were addressed. Residents in internal medicine and anesthesiology were randomly assigned to one of the versions. Usability was evaluated by having participants complete a user satisfaction questionnaire and by recording and analyzing their interactions with the application. The effect on learning was assessed by questions designed to test the retention and transfer of knowledge. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with both versions, with good ratings on the System Usability Scale and adjective rating scale. In contrast, analysis of video recordings revealed significant differences in the occurrence of serious usability problems between the two versions, in particular in the interactive HandsOn case with its treatment simulation, where there was a median of five serious problem instances (range: 0-50) recorded per participant for V1 and zero instances (range: 0-1) for V2 (P < 0.001). There were no differences in tests of retention or transfer of knowledge between the two versions. In conclusion, usability evaluation followed by a redesign of our e-learning resource resulted in significant improvements in usability. This is likely to translate into improved motivation and willingness to engage with the learning material. In this population of relatively high-knowledge participants, learning scores were similar across the two versions.

ID BATMAN
AB Engaging communication of complex scientific concepts with the general public requires more than simplification. Compelling, relevant, and timely points of linkage between scientific concepts and the experiences and interests of the general public are needed. Pop-culture icons such as superheroes can represent excellent opportunities for exploring scientific concepts in a mental "landscape" that is comfortable and familiar. Using an established icon as a familiar frame of reference, complex scientific concepts can then be discussed in a more accessible manner. In this framework, scientists and the general public use the cultural icon to occupy a commonly known performance characteristic. For example, Batman represents a globally recognized icon who represents the ultimate response to exercise and training. The physiology that underlies Batman's abilities can then be discussed and explored using real scientific examples that highlight truths and fallacies contained in the presentation of pop-culture icons. Critically, it is not important whether the popular representation of the icon shows correct science because the real science can be revealed in discussing the character through this lens. Scientists and educators can then use these icons as foils for exploring complex ideas in a context that is less threatening and more comfortable for the target audience. A "middle-ground hypothesis" for science communication is proposed in which pop-culture icons are used to exploring scientific concepts in a bridging mental landscape that is comfortable and familiar. This approach is encouraged for communication with all nonscientists regardless of age.

AB Although a great deal of empirical evidence has indicated that retrieval practice is an effective means of promoting learning and memory, very few studies have investigated the strategy in the context of an actual class. The primary purpose of this study was to determine if a series of very brief retrieval quizzes could significantly improve the retention of previously tested information throughout an anatomy and physiology course. A second purpose was to determine if there were any significant differences between expanding and uniform patterns of retrieval that followed a standardized initial retrieval delay. Anatomy and physiology students were assigned to either a control group or groups that were repeatedly prompted to retrieve a subset of previously tested course information via a series of quizzes that were administered on either an expanding or a uniform schedule. Each retrieval group completed a total of 10 retrieval quizzes, and the series of quizzes required (only) a total of 2 h to complete. Final retention of the exam subset material was assessed during the last week of the semester. There were no significant differences between the expanding and uniform retrieval groups, but both retained an average of 41% more of the subset material than did the control group (ANOVA, F = 129.8, P = 0.00, eta(2)(p) = 0.36). In conclusion, retrieval practice is a highly efficient and effective strategy for enhancing the retention of anatomy and physiology material.

AB Key Points
   Testing for the presence of a condition may give an incorrect result
   Sensitivity and specificity of a test depend upon the chosen cut-off value
   "No difference" usually means "these data do not suggest a difference"
   The power of a test needs to be known to conclude that there is no difference
   Power calculations should be considered if the null hypothesis is not rejected

AB Goswami N, Batzel JJ, Hinghofer-Szalkay H. Assessing formal teaching of ethics in physiology: an empirical survey, patterns, and recommendations. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 188 - 191, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00010.2012.-Ethics should be an important component of physiological education. In this report, we examined to what extent teaching of ethics is formally being incorporated into the physiology curriculum. We carried out an e-mail survey in which we asked the e-mail recipients whether their institution offered a course or lecture on ethics as part of the physiology teaching process at their institution, using the following query: "We are now doing an online survey in which we would like to know whether you offer a course or a lecture on ethics as part of your physiology teaching curriculum." The response rate was 53.3%: we received 104 responses of a total of 195 sent out. Our responses came from 45 countries. While all of our responders confirmed that there was a need for ethics during medical education and scientific training, the degree of inclusion of formal ethics in the physiology curriculum varied widely. Our survey showed that, in most cases (69%), including at our Medical University of Graz, ethics in physiology is not incorporated into the physiology curriculum. Given this result, we suggest specific topics related to ethics and ethical considerations that could be integrated into the physiology curriculum. We present here a template example of a lecture "Teaching Ethics in Physiology" (structure, content, examples, and references), which was based on guidelines and case reports provided by experts in this area (e.g., Benos DJ. Ethics revisited. Adv Physiol Educ 25: 189-190, 2001). This lecture, which we are presently using in Graz, could be used as a base that could lead to greater awareness of important ethical issues in students at an early point in the educational process.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 445-453, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00001.2011.-A challenging topic in undergraduate physiology courses is the complex interaction between the vertebrate endocrine system and the immune system. There are relatively few established and accessible laboratory exercises available to instructors to help their students gain a working understanding of these interactions. The present laboratory module was developed to show students how glucocorticoid receptor activity can be pharmacologically modulated in Xenopus laevis tadpoles and the resulting effects on thymus gland size visualized and quantified in vivo. After treating young tadpoles with a cortisol receptor agonist (dexamethasone) for 1 wk, students can easily visualize the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on the intact thymus gland, which shrinks dramatically in size in response to this steroid hormone analog. However, the suppressive effect of dexamethasone is nullified in the presence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486, which powerfully illustrates the specific effects of glucocorticoid receptor inhibition on the immune system. Image analysis and statistics software are used to quantify the effects of glucocorticoid modulation on thymus size.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 275-279, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00026.2011.-The "Healthy Heart Race" activity provides a hands-on demonstration of cardiovascular function suitable for lay audiences. It was field tested during the United States of America Science and Engineering Festival held in Washington, DC, in October 2010. The basic equipment for the activity consisted of lengths of plastic tubing, a hand pump, collection containers, clamps, and simulated blood prepared by tinting water with red food coloring. Student participants were first asked to experience the effort required to pump through an unaltered tube. A presenter then applied a strong clamp that pinched each tube downstream from the pump, and students were asked to pump against the increased resistance. The students' observations were then used as the basis for discussions of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease with the presenters. Distribution of informative postcards during the 2 days of the festival indicated that at least 2,500 students completed the Healthy Heart Race activity. Our experiences to date suggest that the Healthy Heart Race activity can be accomplished effectively in the high-volume, high-distraction environment of a science fair or museum.

AB Ramirez BU. The sensory modality used for learning affects grades. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 270-274, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00010.2011.-Second-year undergraduated students from 2008, 2009, and 2010 cohorts were asked to respond a questionnaire to determine their learning style preferences, the VARK questionnaire (where V is visual, A is aural, R is reading-writing, and K is kinesthetic), which was translated into Spanish by the author. The translated questionnaire was tested for wording comprehension before its application in the actual study. Using the results of the VARK questionnaire, students were classified as unimodal or multimodal and according to the first preferred sensory modality used for learning as V, A, R, or K learners. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and problems that required simple arithmetic calculations (arithmetic-type questions) were applied to the students. The relation between the main sensory modality used for learning and the grades obtained in each question type was analyzed both in unimodal and multimodal students. It was found that R unimodal students performed significantly better in arithmetic questions than A and K unimodal students (P < 0.001 by a Bonferroni multiple-comparison test after ANOVA). R unimodal students also performed better than R multimodal students in arithmetic questions (P = 0.02 by a Mann-Whitney U-test). However, no differences were observed after MCQs in either unimodal or multimodal students with different first sensory modalities used for learning. When MCQ scores between unimodal and multimodal students were compared, no differences were detected. It was concluded that the sensory learning style used for learning affects student outcome when students receive arithmetic questions but not when MCQs are applied.

AB Richardson D. Is virtual reality a useful tool in the teaching of physiology? Adv Physiol Educ 35: 117-119, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00002.2011.-This opinion statement points out some of the considerations and pitfalls in using virtual reality computer programs in the teaching of life sciences. Emphasis is placed on the possibility of such programs leading to reductionist thinking including how reductionist thinking could foster the formation of misconceptions. Negative feedback is used as the classic example of reductionist thinking in physiological regulation, including how classic negative feedback is inconsistent with evidence of complexity in living systems. This statement concludes that virtual reality can be a useful tool in the teaching of physiology so long as the complexity of living systems is taken into account.

Adv Physiol Educ 34: 205-212, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00005.2010.-Teaching pharmacology to medical students has long been seen as a challenge, and one to which a number of innovative approaches have been taken. In this article, we describe and evaluate the use of primary research articles in teaching second-year medical students both in terms of the information learned and the use of the papers themselves. We designed a seminar where small groups of students worked on different neurotransmitters before contributing information to a plenary session. Student feedback suggested that when the information was largely novel, students learned considerably more. Crucially, this improvement in knowledge was seen even when they had not directly studied a particular transmitter in their work groups, suggesting a shared learning experience. Moreover, the majority of students reported that using primary research papers was easy and useful, with over half stating that they would use them in future study.

Adv Physiol Educ 34: 119-127, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00041.2010.-The war contributions of the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory in Cambridge, MA, were recorded in 169 Technical Reports, most of which were sent to the Office of the Quartermaster General. Earlier reports were sent to the National Research Council and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Many of the reports from 1941 and later dealt with either physical fitness of soldiers or the energetic cost of military tasks in extreme heat and cold. New military emergency rations to be manufactured in large quantities were analyzed in the Fatigue Laboratory and then tested in the field. Newly designed cold weather clothing was tested in the cold chamber at -40 degrees F, and desired improvements were made and tested in the field by staff and soldiers in tents and sleeping bags. Electrically heated clothing was designed for high-altitude flight crews and tested both in laboratory chambers and field tests before being issued. This eye witness account of the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory during World War II was recorded by Dr. G. Edgar Folk, who is likely the sole surviving member of that famous laboratory.

AB Gookin JL, McWhorter D, Vaden S, Posner L. Outcome assessment of a computer-animated model for learning about the regulation of glomerular filtration rate. Adv Physiol Educ 34:97-105, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00012.2010.-The regulation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a particularly important and challenging concept for students to integrate into a memorable framework for building further knowledge and solving clinical problems. In this study, 76 first-year veterinary students and 19 veterinarians in clinical specialty training (house officers) participated in separate online exercises to evaluate the use of a computer-animated model of GFR regulation (www.aamc.org/mededportal)on learning outcome. Students were randomly allocated to study either the animated model or written materials before completion of a 10-question multiple-choice quiz. House officers completed a 35-question test before and after study of the animated model. Both groups completed a survey about the learning exercise. The ability of the model to enhance learning was demonstrated by a significant improvement (P < 0.001) in the test performance of house officers after studying the model. The model performed similarly to written materials alone in affecting the subsequent quiz performance of the students. The majority of students and house officers agreed or strongly agreed that the animated model was easy to understand, improved their knowledge and appreciation of the importance of GFR regulation, and that they would recommend the model to peers. Most students [63 of 76 students (83%)] responded that they would prefer the use of the animated model alone over the study of written materials but acknowledged that a combination of hardcopy written notes and the animated model would be ideal. A greater applicability of the model to more advanced students and an introduction in a didactic setting before individual study were suggested by the house officers. The results of this study suggest that the animated model is a useful, effective, and well-received tool for learning and creating a visual memory of the regulatory mechanisms of GFR.

AB By the beginning of the twentieth century, vitalism was generally rejected and it was accepted that biological organisms obeyed the laws of physics and chemistry. Muscle contraction was thought to be fueled by a chemical reaction. The dawn of muscle energetics began in the early twentieth century when Otto Meyerhof and A. V. Hill made bold attempts to link data from chemical and biochemical studies with those derived from thermal measurements and from the recording of mechanical work. In the search for the direct fuel for muscle contraction, lactic acid formation and phosphocreatine (phosphagen) breakdown turned out to be false trails. Nonetheless, these investigations led to the discovery of ATP and the proposal of the role of ATP as the direct fuel for muscle contraction. Furthermore, this work led to the concept of high-energy phosphate bonds. Glycolysis and phosphocreatine breakdown subsequently were identified as ATP-generating recovery reactions. It was an important and fascinating period in the evolution of muscle research that opened the door for discoveries identifying the universal role of ATP in cellular energetics. This work was done by investigators who lived through turbulent and tragic times between two world wars.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The dawn of muscle energetics began in the early twentieth century when Otto Meyerhof and A.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The maintenance of a more or less constant internal environment by homeostatic (negative feedback) mechanisms is well understood, and "homeostasis" is regarded as an important core concept for students to understand. However, there are critically important control mechanisms that operate at the local level and are more or less independent of homeostasis. Here we define a core concept of "local control," present examples of it in many different organ systems, and propose a conceptual framework for it. Local control, like all of the other core concepts, can provide students with a learning tool that can facilitate understanding physiology.

ID PHYSIOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; HOMEOSTASIS; PRINCIPLES
AB Despite the call from biology educators for students to learn the biological sciences as a unified whole, the teaching of introductory organismal biology is still largely arranged into separate sections that tend to focus exclusively on the biology of individual taxonomic categories (i.e., animals and plants). Conversely, this paper presents a strategy for combining the teaching and learning of introductory animal and plant biology using the core concepts of biology and physiology as tools for integrative learning. The paper outlines the positioning of organismal biology within a two-semester introductory biology course, the topical organization of an integrated organismal biology module around shared physiological functions, the use of core concepts to facilitate the combined learning of the biology of animals and plants, and some instructional practices that can support core concepts as learning tools for organismal biology. Examples of how core concepts serve to integrate the organismal biology of animals and plants are described and explained. The goal of this approach is to show introductory students that the mastery of core concepts can help them integrate their understanding of organismal biology. More broadly, students acquire skills in using core concepts as learning tools in biology that should enable them to better assimilate more advanced concepts and to achieve a more unified study of the biological sciences as they progress through the curriculum.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper is 1) a personal view on why the teaching of introductory animal and plant biology ought to be more integrated and how an integrated module for introductory organismal biology can be designed, and 2) a practical guide to instructors on how core concepts can be used as learning tools to promote the integrated learning of introductory organismal biology.

ID GAMES; COMPETITION
AB Gamification is a dynamic tool for educational transformation useful to encourage student interest and enhance learning. Here we present a study conducted to investigate the effectiveness of an educational card game developed by us in veterinary anatomy practicals to reinforce knowledge acquisition in veterinary students. A total of four sets of cards were designed, each one with different anatomical topics (structure identification, articulation and positioning, clinical anatomy, and comparative anatomy); students were arranged in small groups (7-10 students per group) and played the game at the end of each anatomy practical session, discussing the corresponding questions, randomly chosen, as a team. This activity was highly valued by students, most of whom (>80%) expressed that the game was enjoyable, challenging, helpful to improve their knowledge and understanding in clinical anatomy, and effective for anatomy exam preparation. Thus, the use of educational games in practical sessions seems to improve student engagement in the learning process individually and as a team.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development and implementation of a card game as a training resource that allows learning veterinary anatomy in a motivating and cooperative environment, promoting teamwork, relationships, and trust and communication between colleagues, is described. Stimulating the ability to solve problems as a team has provided help to students preparing for their exams in a more dynamic and enjoyable way.

AB Human physiology is a prerequisite to pathophysiology for baccalaureate of nursing sciences students and requisite for undergraduate exercise sciences students, in an undergraduate health sciences curriculum of Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division. This is the first human physiology course required for these first-year students (following anatomy); as such, methods to help students memorize these newly introduced topics during lecture were key. Here we examine the efficacy of mnemonics in an undergraduate health professions human physiology course. During lectures on the nervous system, cell membrane, and action potentials, the author integrated four mnemonics to assist students in memorizing the details of these topics. Student participants (n = 123) completed an anonymous and voluntary qualitative survey. Their responses to the mnemonics survey indicated an overall positive rate >= 93% of self-reported effectiveness in memorizing these physiological concepts.

AB Practical demonstration of cardiomyocyte function requires substantial preparation, a source of freshly isolated animal hearts, and specialized equipment. Even where such resources are available, it is not conducive for demonstration to any more than a few students at a time. These approaches are also not consistent with the 3R principle (replacement, reduction, and refinement) of ethical use of animals. We present an implementation of the LabHEART software, developed by Donald Bers and Jose Puglisi, for medical students. Prior to the activity, students had lectures covering the physiological and pharmacological aspects of cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. We used this problem-based activity to help students consolidate their knowledge and to allow a hands-on approach to explore the key features of EC coupling. Students simulate and measure action potentials, intracellular calcium changes, and cardiomyocyte contraction. They also apply drugs that target ion channels (e.g., nifedipine or tetrodotoxin) or sympathetic input (using isoproterenol) and explore changes to EC coupling. Furthermore, by modifying the biophysical parameters of key ion channels involved in the electrical activity of the heart, students also explore the effect of channelopathies such as long QT syndromes. We describe approaches to implement this activity in a flipped classroom format, with recorded lecture materials provided ahead of the practical to facilitate active learning. We also describe our experiences implementing this activity online. The content and difficulty of the activity can be altered to suit individual courses and is also amenable to promote peer-driven learning.

   two-semester course sequence

AB This qualitative study investigated processes used by undergraduate students over a course sequence in anatomy and physiology (A&P). Longitudinal data for each participant include weekly written reflections and interviews at the beginning, middle, and end of the two-semester sequence. The themes that emerged describe three variations of approach to learning the course content. In some cases, the focus was on completing tasks and actions without connecting those to a specific outcome. In other cases, the focus was on outcomes without specific references to what steps might lead to that outcome. A third approach explicitly linked tasks and actions to one or more of nine different outcomes, including both personal and course expectations. Two other themes emerged as salient in combination with the three approaches: self-identified shortcomings with their study approaches and affective responses to the course and content. Affective responses included both positive affect such as enjoyment or excitement and negative affect such as frustration or dislike. Understanding the approaches that students take to learning, combined with their affect and shortcomings in those approaches, can inform instructor decisions about course activities and resources that support specific learning outcomes. It also provides a foundational knowledge base for the development of context-specific instruments for quantifying student learning processes in A&P.

ID CONCEPTIONS
AB Students find cardiovascular physiology challenging. Misunderstandings can be due to the nature of the subject, the way it is taught, and prior knowledge, which impede learning of new concepts. Some misunderstood concepts can be corrected with teaching (i.e., preconceptions), whereas others are resistant to instruction (i.e., misconceptions). A set of questions, specifically created by a panel of physiology experts to probe difficult cardiovascular concepts, was used to identify preconceptions, misconceptions, and the effect of education level on question performance. The introductory cardiovascular lecture used in this study was created based on these questions. In-class polling of medical students' (n = 736) performance was performed using the Turning-Point clicker response system during lecture instruction. Results were compared with published data from undergraduates (n = 1,076) who completed the same questions but without prior instruction. To our knowledge, there have been no studies directly comparing performance using the same instrument and large numbers of undergraduate and medical students. A higher education level was associated with increased performance (preconceptions), whereas several concepts resistant to instruction (misconceptions) were identified. Findings suggest that prior knowledge interfered with the acquisition of medical knowledge. Based on these results, potential causes for these misconceptions and remedial teaching suggestions are discussed.

DE aging; curriculum integration; medical physiology
AB As the Baby Boomer generation reaches old age, there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults needing healthcare over the past decade. The physiology of aging is therefore a highly relevant topic for the preclinical medical curriculum. I describe a new capstone unit on the physiology of aging, placed at the end a medical physiology course, to provide a vehicle for integration of prior learning about physiology of each individual body system. Students were provided with online self-study modules as preparation for a mandatory small group case-based learning activity. A detailed case of an elderly female patient being assessed for fall risk was provided. Students were required to document a "Review of Systems" predicting decreased system functions due to senescence and to prepare a group concept map illustrating how physiologic deficits contributed to fall risk in the patient. Students successfully completed the activity and reported generally good satisfaction with the experience. The activity was judged an effective tool for students to consolidate prior learning and to apply physiology to an important medical topic. The lesson also provided several opportunities for curriculum integration with cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and clinical skills components.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE analogy; membrane potential; physiology education
AB University-level physiology courses are considered challenging. Postsecondary instructors indicate the top three reasons that make physiology courses difficult for student are 1) the need for the learner to reason mechanistically, 2) the belief among students that memorization is equal to learning, and 3) the need to think about the physiological systems as dynamic systems. One topic that encompasses all three aforementioned challenges is membrane potential and its determinants in living organisms. Membrane potential is the mechanism that underlies numerous physiological processes; memorization of these processes does not equate to understanding, and its very nature is highly dynamic. Unfortunately, students find the topic challenging, and even students who have learned and practiced the topic in previous terms, fail to retain the conceptual understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Importantly, understanding many systemic physiological processes relies on students' mastery of concepts related to membrane potential. Stephan H. Wright rightfully wrote that "It would be difficult to exaggerate the physiological significance of [membrane potential]". Therefore, to more effectively facilitate students' learning of additional topics, educators must ensure that students can build on, understand, and appreciate the complexities of membrane potential determination. This article presents a tool to aid instructors of all level in teaching the topic of membrane potential.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an active methodology combined with a lecture on undergraduate student learning and levels of stress and anxiety. The active learning methodology consisted of a lecture of 50-min duration, study at home with a textbook, an educational game activity, and three formative assessments on the topic of the cardiac cycle. In a following class, the students provided saliva samples to evaluate their levels of stress, received an anxiety test, and then undertook an exam to assess their understanding of the cardiac cycle. The traditional teaching methodology consisted of two lectures (similar to 2-h duration) on blood pressure control systems, delivered orally. In the third class, the students provided saliva samples, received an anxiety test, and then undertook an exam to assess their understanding of blood pressure control systems. The level of stress was assessed with the concentrations of the stress biomarkers cortisol and alpha-amylase in saliva. Anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. The students achieved significantly higher average scores in exams when the active learning strategy was applied compared with the use of traditional theoretical classes. The active methodology resulted in significantly lower levels of stress and anxiety, as well as improved student performance, compared with the use of traditional lectures.

AB Positive attitude and self-evaluation are necessary for medical students and doctors. To explore bow best to integrate physiology teaching in our Thai medical curriculum, we investigated relationships between student's academic performance, their attitude, self-evaluated knowledge, and proportion of physiology taught in an organ-system integrated block. We organized 13 physiology laboratory classes, during which students self-rated attitude and knowledge. Academic performance was measured by formative and summative assessments. One hundred thirty-six participants were categorized into most proactive (Most PA), more proactive (More PA), less proactive (Less PA), and least proactive (Least PA) attitude groups by self-preparation questionnaire. Eighty participants were categorized into high (HighE), moderate (ModerateE), and low (LowE) self-evaluation rating groups. Mean formatives score in the Most PA group was significantly higher than in the other PA groups (P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). Mean summative score in the Most PA group was significantly higher than the Less PA and the Least PA groups (P = 0.017 and P = 0.015 respectively). There was no significant difference in mean assessment scores among HighE, ModerateE, and LowE groups. Proportion of teaching time dedicated to physiology positively correlated with student attitude (r = 0.84, P = 0.001) and negatively correlated with self-evaluation rating (r = -0.73, P = 0.007). Thai medical students may benefit from a proactive attitude to studying physiology, contrasting with traditional didactic expectations of Thai education. Proportion of teaching time dedicated to physiology does not influence academic performance; therefore, future adjustments to curriculum integration may incorporate classes that facilitate self-directed learning. Future study should explore other influences on learning and assessment performance.

AB Evidence shows that biomedical knowledge is more effectively taught within the medical curriculum by teaching in context, to facilitate learning transfer. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of combining high-technology simulation and physiology teaching on medical student learning and experience. First-year medical students received respiratory physiology teaching in the form of lectures, problem-based learning. and practical sessions. These students were then given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and problem solve using respiratory-related clinical case scenarios in simulated patients. Student understanding was assessed using a short quiz performed immediately before and after the session. Results revealed that the session significantly improved the mean score on tests (6.97 +/- 0.29 vs. 8.22 +/- 0.19, P < 0.001). Student evaluation was collected in focus groups, and recurring concepts were extracted from the data. Students reported that the sessions helped to bridge the gap between theory and practice, which aided their learning. In addition, this teaching methodology (simulation) was reportedly patient centered and added to the realism of the simulated scenario, with students stating that this teaching improved their confidence with managing real patients and clinical uncertainty. Simulation has been used extensively to teach clinical skills; however, research regarding its potential for teaching biomedical science within a clinical context is limited. Our study shows that combining high-technology simulation and physiology teaching contributed to an immediate improvement in medical student knowledge and enhanced their ability to make connections between theoretical knowledge and the world of practice.

AB Microbial physiology is a basic course taught throughout biomedical science disciplines. Students study the structure, growth, and metabolism of microorganisms and often find it difficult to learn the information, usually because they fail to see the wider applications. The current microbiology laboratory series describes how to transform a "cookbook" undergraduate laboratory to an inquiry-based one by incorporating problem-based learning. The students use a food poisoning case study that develops over a series of seven experiments and take on the role of the microbiology technician who is responsible for coming up with the answer and submitting a report to a clinician. The case provides coherence to the sessions, and the students are given the opportunity to learn about, and practice, common techniques they would encounter in a clinical microbiology laboratory. Those include the aseptic method, cultivation of bacteria, quantification of bacteria in culture, isolation of pure culture, morphological observation by light microscopy, Gram staining, the use of selective and differential media, and the effectiveness of a variety of antimicrobials and antibiotics. This laboratory series has been designed so that it can be implemented in any setting, using simple materials and inexpensive, nonspecialized equipment. The experiments are carried out in small groups, and a facilitator may tutor up to two groups of 10 students at a time. The current method has been successfully implemented for the past 2 yr, and the students demonstrated greater motivation in learning and understanding.

AB Student presentations had been widely implemented across content areas, including health sciences education. However, due to various limitations, small-group student presentations in the classroom may not reach their full potential for student learning. To address challenges with presentations in the classroom, we redesigned the assignment by having students present and discuss online using VoiceThread, a cloud-based presentation and discussion tool. First-year students pursuing a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree were assigned into small groups to present physiology content and to discuss that content online. This assignment was similar to traditional student classroom presentations, with the exception that the entire assignment was conducted online. The primary purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the impact of the online format on the discussion quality. Another purpose of the study was to examine students' perceptions of using VoiceThread for presenting and learning, as well as the online interactions between the presenter and audience. Students posted a higher number of questions and comments than required by the assignment. The questions from students were also higher level questions, and the answers to these questions were more thorough compared with what we had previously observed in classroom presentations. The survey results showed that students preferred using VoiceThread for presenting, learning from other presentations, and discussing presentation content over performing this process in the classroom. Preliminary findings suggested that having dental students make presentations and hold discussions online might help address the challenges of student presentations in the classroom.

ID STRESSORS; TEACHER; ME
AB Human emotions, such as anxiety, depression, fear, joy, and laughter, profoundly affect psychological and physiological processes. These emotions form a set of basic, evolved functions that are shared by all humans. Laughter is part of a universal language of basic emotions that all humans recognize. Health care providers and educators may utilize the power of laughter to improve health and enhance teaching and learning. This is an important consideration because teaching is not just about content: it is also about forming relationships and strengthening human connections. In this context, when used effectively, humor is documented to build relationships and enhance performance. Specifically, humor improves student performance by attracting and sustaining attention, reducing anxiety, enhancing participation, and increasing motivation. Moreover, humor stimulates multiple physiological systems that decrease levels of stress hormones, such as cortisol and epinephrine, and increase the activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. To achieve these benefits, it is important to use humor that is relevant to the course content and not disparaging toward others. Self-effacing humor illustrates to students that the teacher is comfortable making mistakes and sharing these experiences with the classroom. In this brief review, we discuss the history and relationship between humor, laughing, learning, and health with an emphasis on the powerful, universal language of laughter.

AB Ingested or penetrating foreign bodies are common in veterinary medicine. When they are radiolucent, these objects become a diagnostic challenge, but they can be investigated sonographically. However, successful object identification depends on the skill of the sonographer. Considering that these cases appear randomly during hospital routines, it is not always possible to train all students to identify them correctly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to produce homemade simulations of radiolucent foreign bodies for veterinary student demonstrations that could be identified sonographically and to evaluate the acceptability, applicability, and usefulness of these simulations according to a visual analog scale questionnaire and subjective questions. For this purpose, object models (a pacifier nipple, a toy ball, a sock, nylon thread, and a mango seed) were designed, produced, and immersed in gelatin. To simulate wood splinters in the integumentary and musculoskeletal system, a piece of meat punctured with a toothpick and ice cream stick splinters were used. The type of phantom had a determinant effect on the visualization (chi-square = 36.528, P = 0.0001) and recognition (chi-square = 18.756, P = 0.0021) capability of the students. All of the students answered that their experience with the models could help in real situations. The student responses to the questionnaire indicated that the project was well accepted, and the participants believed that this experience could be applicable to and useful in veterinary routines.

AB The ability to critically evaluate and use evidence from one's own work or from primary literature is invaluable to any researcher. These skills include the ability to identify strengths and weakness of primary literature, to gauge the impact of research findings on a field, to identify gaps in a field that require more research, and to contextualize findings within a field. This study developed a model to examine undergraduate science students' abilities to critically evaluate and use evidence through an analysis of laboratory reports from control and experimental groups in nonresearch- aligned and research-aligned inquiry-based laboratory classes, respectively, and contrasted these with published scientific research articles. The reports analyzed (n = 42) showed that students used evidence in a variety of ways, most often referring to literature indirectly, and least commonly highlighting limitations of literature. There were significant positive correlations between grade awarded and the use of references, evidence, and length, but there were no significant differences between control and experimental groups, so data were pooled. The use of evidence in scientific research articles (n = 7) was similar to student reports except that expert authors were more likely to refer to their own results and cite more references. Analysis showed that students, by the completion of the second year of their undergraduate degree, had expertise approaching that of published authors. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to provide valuable broad-scale undergraduate research experiences to all students in a cohort, giving them exposure to the methods and communication processes of research as well as an opportunity to hone their critical evaluation skills.

AB Curriculum-embedded independent research is a high-impact teaching practice that has been shown to increase student engagement and learning. This article describes a multiweek laboratory project for an upper-division undergraduate cell physiology laboratory using apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway as the overarching theme. Students did literature research on apoptotic agents that acted via the mitochondrial pathway. Compounds ranged from natural products such as curcumin to synthetic compounds such as etoposide. Groups of two to three students planned a series of experiments using one of three cultured cell lines that required them to 1) learn to culture cells; 2) determine treatment conditions, including apoptotic agent solubility and concentration ranges that had been reported in the literature; 3) choose two methods to validate/quantify apoptotic capacity of the reagent; and 4) attempt to "rescue" cells from undergoing apoptosis using one of several available compounds/methods. In essence, given some reagent and equipment constraints, students designed an independent experiment to highlight the effects of different apoptotic agents on cells in culture. Students presented their experimental designs as in a laboratory group meeting and their final findings as a classroom "symposium." This exercise can be adapted to many different types of laboratories with greater or lesser equipment and instrumentation constraints, incorporates several core cell physiology methods, and encourages key experimental design and critical thinking components of independent research.

AB In the present article, we describe a 3-day experimental workshop on glycemia regulation and type 1 diabetes that engages students in open-ended investigations and guided experiments leading to results that are not already known to them. After an initial questioning phase during which students observe PowerPoint slides depicting the glycemia (blood glucose levels) of individuals in various situations, students design, execute, and interpret experiments to address one of the following questions: 1) Which criteria must an animal model of diabetes fulfill? 2) How do pancreatic cells maintain glycemia constant? and 3) Is there a way to produce an insulin protein similar to the one released by human pancreatic cells? Students then 1) measure glycemia and glycosuria in control mice and in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes (Alloxan-treated mice), 2) measure the release of insulin by pancreatic beta-cells (INS-1 cell line) in response to different concentrations of glucose in the extracellular medium, and 3) transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells with a plasmid coding for green fluorescent protein, observe green fluorescent protein fluorescence of some of the transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells under the microscope, and observe the characteristics of human insulin protein and its three-dimensional conformation using RASMOL software. At the end of the experimental session, students make posters and present their work to researchers. Back at school, they may also present their work to their colleagues.

AB The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of changing a laboratory physiology course for undergraduate students from a traditional step-by-step guided structure to an inquiry-based approach. With this aim in mind, quantitative and qualitative evaluations of learning outcomes (individual subject-specific tests and group interviews) were performed for a laboratory course in cardiorespiratory exercise physiology that was conducted in one year with a traditional step-by-step guided manual (traditional course) and the next year completed with an inquiry-based structure (I-based course). The I-based course was a guided inquiry course where students had to design the experimental protocol and conduct their own study on the basis of certain predefined criteria (i.e., they should evaluate respiratory responses to submaximal and maximal exercise and provide indirect and direct measures of aerobic exercise capacity). The results indicated that the overall time spent on the experimental course as well as self-evaluated learning outcomes were similar across groups. However, students in the I-based course used more time in preparation (102 +/- 5 min) than students in the traditional course (42 +/- 3 min, P < 0.05), and 65 +/- 5% students in the I-based course searched for additional literature before experimentation compared with only 2 +/- 1% students in the traditional course. Furthermore, students in the I-based course achieved a higher (P < 0.05) average score on the quantitative test (45 +/- 3%) compared with students in the traditional course (31 +/- 4%). Although students were unfamiliar with cardiorespiratory exercise physiology and the experimental methods before the course, it appears that an inquiry-based approach rather than one that provides students with step-by-step instructions may benefit learning outcomes in a laboratory physiology course.

These roles are facilitated by establishing a social contract between the instructor and learner, a contract that clearly defines the rights and duties of each. Adopting greater responsibility for the development of competencies in our learners allows faculty members to truly have an impact by shaping the behaviors of learners.

AB A concept of major importance in human electrophysiology studies is the process by which activation of an excitable cell results in a rapid rise and fall of the electrical membrane potential, the so-called action potential. Hodgkin and Huxley proposed a model to explain the ionic mechanisms underlying the formation of action potentials. However, this model is unsuitably complex for teaching purposes. In addition, the Hodgkin and Huxley approach describes the shape of the action potential only in terms of ionic currents, i.e., it is unable to explain the electrical significance of the action potential or describe the electrical field arising from this source using basic concepts of electromagnetic theory. The goal of the present report was to propose a new model to describe the electrical behaviour of the action potential in terms of elementary electrical sources (in particular, dipoles). The efficacy of this model was tested through a closed-book written exam. The proposed model increased the ability of students to appreciate the distributed character of the action potential and also to recognize that this source spreads out along the fiber as function of space. In addition, the new approach allowed students to realize that the amplitude and sign of the extracellular electrical potential arising from the action potential are determined by the spatial derivative of this intracellular source. The proposed model, which incorporates intuitive graphical representations, has improved students' understanding of the electrical potentials generated by bioelectrical sources and has heightened their interest in bioelectricity.

AB Vargas R, Johannesdottir Ip, Sigurgeirsson B, porsteinsson H, Karlsson KAE. The zebrafish brain in research and teaching: a simple in vivo and in vitro model for the study of spontaneous neural activity. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 188-196, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00099.2010.-Recently, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been established as a key animal model in neuroscience. Behavioral, genetic, and immunohistochemical techniques have been used to describe the connectivity of diverse neural circuits. However, few studies have used zebrafish to understand the function of cerebral structures or to study neural circuits. Information about the techniques used to obtain a workable preparation is not readily available. Here, we describe a complete protocol for obtaining in vitro and in vivo zebrafish brain preparations. In addition, we performed extracellular recordings in the whole brain, brain slices, and immobilized nonanesthetized larval zebrafish to evaluate the viability of the tissue. Each type of preparation can be used to detect spontaneous activity, to determine patterns of activity in specific brain areas with unknown functions, or to assess the functional roles of different neuronal groups during brain development in zebrafish. The technique described offers a guide that will provide innovative and broad opportunities to beginner students and researchers who are interested in the functional analysis of neuronal activity, plasticity, and neural development in the zebrafish brain.

AB Shafi R, Quadri KH, Ahmed W, Mahmud SN, Iqbal M. Experience with a theme-based integrated renal module for a second-year MBBS class. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 15-19, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00069.2009.-Integrated learning is the need of the hour. We at Shifa College of Medicine switched to an integrated modular curriculum last year. In the present article, we describe our experience with the renal module in year 2 of a 5-yr undergraduate medical curriculum. A multidisciplinary renal modular team developed the relevant objectives, themes, and clinical cases. The learning strategies used were large-group interactive sessions, small-group learning, problem-based learning, practicals, and self-directed learning. Assessment was both formative and summative. Student and faculty feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of the module. Forty-four percent of the students agreed that the basic science and clinical concepts were well balanced and integrated. Fifty-seven percent of the students believed that important learning issues could be identified and that participation and critical thinking were encouraged during the small-group sessions. Eighty-five percent of the facilitators agreed that they were able to motivate students for critical thinking and better learning through integrating various disciplines. In conclusion, the integrated method of curricular delivery was well received by students and faculty members, and it can be used successfully in undergraduate medical education in developing countries.

AB Biomedical graduate students receive intensive training in their scientific area of interest yet need additional skills for successful scientific careers. Our aim was to promote team building, improve collaborations and enhance communication skills. An off-site yearly retreat was organized for the graduate students in our NIH-funded Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) graduate training program. Retreat themes were addressed through short presentations, case studies, live podcasts, webinars, focus groups, role-play, and breakout sessions with various team building exercises to practice communication skills and identify abilities, knowledge, values, and behaviors. Trainees gave short presentations and served as discussion leaders on topics related to the central theme. Expert guest speakers participated in discussion sessions with the trainees. Trainees evaluated the retreats at the end. A total of 48 trainees, 12 RISE Program faculty and staff, and 26 external speakers from industry, academia, media/journalism, the arts, psychology, and holistic medical fields participated over 9 years. The overall average benefit of the in-person retreats was rated 4.80 on a Likert scale of 1-5 by trainees. Trainees particularly enjoyed the informal interactions with program faculty, staff, and fellow trainees. They appreciated the opportunity to learn soft skills, such as interpersonal communication, conflict resolution, and leadership. Two additional retreats conducted virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic were perceived as less beneficial. We conclude that off-site interactive retreats are a valuable tool for enhancing soft skills and a sense of team identity in a biomedical sciences graduate program, while covering important issues related to scientific careers.

AB Knowledge about the key steps in "research methodology" is necessary for all postgraduate students who are enrolled in the medical profession. The objective of the present study was to plan, design, and implement a participant-centric postgraduate skill development activity to inculcate the key principles and components of research methodology. It included 3 goal-oriented component group exercises, namely, 1) framing a research question, 2) critiquing a research article, and 3) writing a research protocol. Out of 25 eligible postgraduate students of our department, 20 participated in all three component group exercises, and they were included in the study. Feedback was obtained from them on a five-point Likert scale after the group exercises. In addition, students were also asked to provide open-ended comments for further improvement of the session. Data from participants' feedback suggested that the majority of the participants expressed satisfaction regarding the plan, conduct, and learning experience of the postgraduate activity. Therefore, participant-centric group activity could be an innovative approach in postgraduate medical education to inculcate the basics of research methodology. It can provide additional emphasis on the components of self-directed learning through individual exercises and unsupervised group dynamics. Supervised group dynamics can inculcate skills in critical thinking, acceptance, communication skills, and teamwork.

ID FACULTY
AB Australia-wide consensus was reached on seven core concepts of physiology, which included homeostasis, a fundamental concept for students to understand as they develop their basic knowledge of physiological regulatory mechanisms. The term homeostasis is most commonly used to describe how the internal environment of mammalian systems maintains relative constancy. The descriptor "the internal environment of the organism is actively regulated by the responses of cells, tissues, and organs through feedback systems" was unpacked by a team of three Australian Physiology educators into 5 themes and 18 subthemes arranged in a hierarchy. Using a five-point Likert scale, the unpacked concept was rated by 24 physiology educators from 24 Australian Universities for level of importance and level of difficulty for students. Survey data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to compare between and within concept themes and subthemes. There were no differences in main themes for level of importance, with all ratings between essential or important. Theme 1: the organism has regulatory mechanisms to maintain a relatively stable internal environment, a process known as homeostasis was almost unanimously rated as essential. Difficulty ratings for unpacked concept themes averaged between slightly difficult and moderately difficult. The Australian team concurred with published literature that there are inconsistencies in the way the critical components of homeostatic systems are represented and interpreted. We aimed to simplify the components of the concept so that undergraduates would be able to easily identify the language used and build on NEW & NOTEWORTHY The homeostasis core concept of physiology was defined and unpacked by an Australian team with the goal of constructing a resource that will improve learning and teaching of this core physiology concept in an Australian Higher

AB A new teaching format, the LecturePlus, was formulated as a lecture followed by small-group learning activities. This study assessed the effectiveness of LecturePlus in medical education. An interventional study was conducted among final-year medical students, with 74 students in the experimental group and 96 students in the control group. Each LecturePlus lasted -1 h and was conducted with 12-18 students. A LecturePlus session comprised of a lecture followed by small-group problem-solving exercises. The exercises were clinical cases with open-ended short-answer questions. Students were divided into groups of three (triads) for these exercises. A faculty tutor assisted the small groups as needed. Closure was achieved through a discussion moderated by the tutor. Learning outcomes were assessed via the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject scores and compared with those of the preceding academic year. An additional multiple-choice question (MCQ) test was administered before and after the clerkship. The MCQ test showed improvement in knowledge application (P < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.42). There was a statistically significant improvement in adjusted NBME scores among female students (74.8 vs. 71.8; P = 0.017) but not among male students. An anonymous written questionnaire survey showed high ratings for LecturePlus (95% selecting yes or partly yes to overall satisfaction). LecturePlus is an instructional strategy that integrates a lecture with learning activities. It can be scaled to large class sizes facilitated by one teacher. By combining didactic teaching with problem-solving, this new instructional strategy may foster application of knowledge. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We developed a new structured teaching format, the LecturePlus, to promote deep learning. A LecturePlus session consists of a brief lecture, followed by small-group problem-solving exercises, ending with a closing discussion moderated by the teacher. During the small-group exercises, students were divided into groups of three (triads) and given case-based problems. One faculty tutor supervised the entire session. LecturePlus resulted in improved learning outcomes and was rated highly by medical students.

AB The interchange among the energy-providing phosphagen, glycolytic, and aerobic systems during exercise is often poorly understood by beginning students in exercise physiology. Exercise is oftentimes thought of as being aerobic or anaerobic, with the body progressing sequentially from one system to the next, although the energy systems work synergistically to produce energy from the onset of exercise, and all ultimately use oxygen. Traditional methods of teaching these concepts using only indirect calorimetry and a metabolic cart can be misleading. Relatively inexpensive noninvasive monitors of muscle oxygenation levels (Smo(2)) provide a useful tool to help students better understand the contribution and timing of these three systems of ATP generation and convey the concept that ultimately all energy production in the human body is oxygen dependent. In this laboratory, students use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIPS) to visualize oxygen utilization by skeletal muscle during exercise by devising three exercise unique protocols, with each designed to stress a different energy system. Students then perform their protocols while using NIRS to measure and analyze Smo(2). Students generate graphs with collected data, allowing them to visualize and appreciate oxygen consumption during all three protocols as well as elevated oxygen consumption after exercise. The students learn that any exercise is really all about oxygen.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Traditional methods of teaching bioenergetics using indirect calorimetry and a metabolic cart may be misleading. Recent advances in technology have made near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) a relatively inexpensive, noninvasive means of monitoring muscle oxygen levels during exercise. In this laboratory activity, NIRS devices are used for hands-on exploration of the synergistic nature of the energy systems, allowing students to appreciate the synergistic nature of the energy systems and how all exercise is really all about oxygen.

AB In the early 1950s Setsuro Ebashi was a graduate student at Tokyo University studying the biochemical models of muscle contraction. The muscle components in these models contracted in the presence of ATP, but what caught his attention was that the components did not relax when ATP was exhausted. Ebashi decided in 1952 to attempt to elucidate the mechanism of muscle relaxation using these models. This decision started a journey that would lead him to be the first to propose the calcium concept of muscle contraction and relaxation in 1961. It was an unpopular theory with biochemists who refused to accept that anything as simple as an inorganic ion, Ca2+, could control anything as important as muscle contraction. Ebashi was convinced that he was correct. He proceeded to show that micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ activated contraction. In 1961 he discovered the particulate nature of the ATP-dependent relaxing factor (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and determined that it acted by binding Ca2+. Most notably, in 1966 he discovered troponin, the Ca2+ receptor in muscle, which mediated Ca2+ control of contraction. Ebashi's discoveries were considered the most important in the muscle field since the 1950s. Ebashi had to overcome the doubt of the scientific community. This story is one of great scientific achievement against great odds that marked the emergence of Japanese muscle research onto the international scientific stage.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Setsuro Ebashi proposed the calcium concept of muscle contraction and relaxation in 1961. It was a very unpopular theory. He showed that Ca2+ activated contraction and that the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused relaxation by binding Ca2+ in an ATP-dependent manner. Most notably, he discovered the receptor that mediated Ca2+ control of contraction and named it "troponin." Ebashi's discoveries are considered to be the most important in the muscle field since the 1950s.

DT Article
DE COVID-19 pandemic; flipped teaching; student assessment
AB The COVID-19 pandemic forced teaching to be shifted to an online platform. Since the flipped teaching (FT) model has been shown to engage students through active learning strategies and adapt both synchronous and asynchronous components, it was a convenient choice for educators familiar with this instructional method. This study tested the effectiveness of a virtual FT method during the pandemic in a graduate-level physiology course. Besides assessing knowledge gained in the virtual FT format, student surveys were used to measure student perception of their adjustment to the new FT format, their confidence in completing the course successfully, and the usefulness of assessments and assignments in the remote FT. Students reported that they adjusted well to the remote FT method (P < 0.001), and their confidence in completing the course in this teaching mode successfully improved from the beginning to the end of the semester (P < 0.05). Students expressed a positive response to the synchronous computerized exams (90.32%) and the formative group (93.51%) and individual (80.65%) assessments. Both collaborative activities (93.55%) and in-class discussions (96.77%) were found to be effective. The course evaluations and the overall semester scores were comparable to the previous semesters of face-to-face FT. Overall, students' perceptions and performance suggested that they embraced the virtual FT method and the tested teaching method maintained the same strong outcome as before. Thus, this study presents a promising new instructional method in the teaching of future physiology courses.

AB Gap years have grown in popularity among students attempting to go to medical school in recent years. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), more than half of matriculated students now have taken time off between their undergraduate studies and medical school. Although many claim benefits to taking gap years, research on the impacts of these experiences on medical students is largely nonexistent. This study aimed to qualitatively analyze the gap year phenomenon and its impacts on medical students through semistructured interviews conducted at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. Through these interviews, the research team collected in-depth responses that were thematically analyzed. Analysis revealed the following major themes regarding the impacts of gap years: 1) adaptability to change and failure, 2) professional identity formation and understanding of team role, 3) understanding the "real world," 4) refocusing of goals, 5) resilience and stress management, and 6) reinforcement of motivation.

AB As a result of the installation of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, online education has become an important teaching alternative, and new challenges about how to teach were found. Here we report our experience in offering an online course to review Human Physiology. We proposed synchronous and asynchronous activities using different online tools to address topics considered key to understanding the different systems of human physiology. The students considered important the use of this type of methodology, which uses different online tools to help understand the Human Physiology contents. The students highlighted the use of the Lt platform, Zoom, Mentimeter, and YouTube as the preferred online tools to use in physiology learning.

AB Anatomy and Physiology courses taught at community colleges tend to focus laboratory hours primarily on anatomy as opposed to physiology. However, research demonstrates that, when instructors utilize active learning approaches (such as in laboratory settings) where students participate in their own learning, students have improved outcomes, such as higher test scores and better retention of material. To provide community college students with opportunities for active learning in physiology, we developed two laboratory exercises to engage students in cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology. We utilized low-cost SpikerBox devices to measure electrical activity during cardiac (electrocardiogram) and skeletal muscle (electromyogram) contraction. Laboratory activities were employed in Anatomy and Physiology courses at two community colleges in southeast Michigan. A 2-h laboratory period was structured with a 20-min slide presentation covering background material on the subject and experiments to examine the effects of environmental variables on nervous system control of cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction. Students were asked to provide hypotheses and proposed mechanisms, complete a results section, and provide conclusions for the experiments based on their results. Our laboratory exercises improved student learning in physiology and knowledge of the scientific method and were well-received by community college students enrolled in Anatomy and Physiology. Our results demonstrate that the use of a SpikerBox for cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology concepts is a low-cost and effective approach to integrate physiology activities into an Anatomy and Physiology course.

AB The new generations of physicians are, to a large extent, unaware of the complex philosophical and biological concepts that created the bases of modern medicine. Building on the Hellenistic tradition of the four humors and their qualities. Galen (AD 129 to c. 216) provided a persuasive scheme of the structure and function of the cardiorespiratory system, which lasted, without serious contest, for 1.300 yr. Galen combined teleological concepts with careful clinical observation to defend a coherent and integrated system in which the fire-heart flaming at the center of the body-interacts with lungs' air-pneuma to create life. Remarkably, however, he achieved these goals, despite failing to grasp the concept of systemic and pulmonary blood circulations, understand the source and destiny of venous and arterial blood. recognize the lung as the organ responsible for gas exchange, comprehend the actual events taking place in the left ventricle, and identify the source of internal heat. In this article, we outline the alternative theories Galen put forward to explain these complex phenomena. We then discuss how the final consequences of Galen's flawed anatomical and physiological conceptions do not differ substantially from those obtained if one applies modern concepts. Recognition of this state of affairs may explain why the ancient practitioner could achieve relative success, without harming the patient, to understand and treat a multitude of symptoms and illnesses.

AB To better prepare physiology students for 21st century careers, we incorporated classroom-based undergraduate research experiences and service learning/community-engaged learning (SLCE) into a college-level physiology laboratory course. The interventions were incorporated over 4 yr and assessed using validated surveys of student-reported learning gains related to attitudes toward science, the scientific process, and career paths. Students reported the greatest learning gains in those years when students did novel research oriented around a common theme of water quality. The gains were greater than those of a matched cohort that participated in an apprentice-style summer undergraduate research experience. With respect to the SLCE related to youth science literacy, students provided evidence of learning related to academics, personal growth, and civic mindedness. For example, many expressed discomfort about being in a new situation, often describing the differences between themselves and the youth with whom they interacted. However, students also grew in confidence about collaborating with people who were different from them and in their role as the "scientist." Limitations of the study include the quasi-experimental design and the incorporation of multiple interventions at the same time. Future studies should examine improvement in content acquisition and competency-based learning skills. Nonetheless, these results suggest that both novel research and SLCE increase student learning in the context of an undergraduate physiology laboratory course. Many of the learning gains observed with the SLCE are particularly important for physiology students, many of whom aspire to careers in health sciences, where they will be regularly working with nonscientists.

AB The X-Men are an ensemble of superheroes whose powers are associated with the X-Gene, a mutant genetic factor. The powers exhibited by each character differ and are dependent on how the X-Gene has modified their individual genomes. For instance, Wolverine possesses regenerative healing, Storm can control local weather systems, and Colossus can create an impenetrable "organic steel" layer around his body. Thanks to the establishment of the superhero genre in modem cinema, audiences are familiar with Colossus from films such as X-Men: Days of Future Past and Deadpool. While attaining this power might be attractive to many people, there arc innumerate scientific obstacles to be overcome to replicate this "organic steel" layer. Due to its unique combination of high strength and flexibility, a graphene-based layer might he a more realistic material for Colossus' impenetrable skin and would also address a number of physiological issues associated with an "organic steel" layer. The actualization of this layer would depend on complex processes associated with protein folding, protein self-assembly, and changing the structure of his skin. In the classroom, Colossus can foster a multidisciplinary learning environment where concepts in physiology can overlap with topics in physics, engineering, and materials science. Just like other superheroes, Colossus can also be used to promote scientific content in outreach for the general public.

AB Peer-assisted learning (PAL) is nowadays commonly implemented in medical education. Mostly PAL is utilized to specifically support teaching within one subject or a specific curricular situation. Here, we present a large-scale peer teaching program that aims to address the individual student's learning needs. In addition, it provides a platform for students to participate in academic teaching. A retrospective data analysis was performed to reveal the program's development and acceptance. The program was implemented in 2008/09 with three tutorials conducted by 24 student tutors to support students preparing for reexaminations. Since then, the program has continuously grown. In 2015/16, 140 tutors conducted 52 tutorials, consisting of 2,750 lessons for 1,938 tutees. New tutorial categories were continuously introduced. In 2015/16, these encompassed tutorials that were held concomitantly to the formal curriculum, tutorials that exceeded the contents of the formal curriculum, tutorials for preparation for the state examination, and electives. Evaluations among the tutees revealed that 93.5% of the respondents rated the courses overall as "good" or "excellent" (n = 13,489) in 2015/16. All elements of the peer teaching program are managed by one academic group. This encompasses the organization of tutorials, the quality management, and the qualification of tutors, including content-related supervision and didactic training. We conclude that the implementation of a large-scale peer teaching program can complement the formal curriculum. This might be beneficial for both tutors who can actively train their didactic and content-related competencies, and tutees who can autonomously consolidate and expand their knowledge.

AB Physiology teaching resources have advanced to include innovative pedagogical approaches that meet the learning expectations of the current generation of students, while at the same time ensuring content delivery is accurate and the use of technologies is appropriate. We developed a quick experimental assay protocol to introduce the basic concepts of cardiac rhythms, and to demonstrate simultaneously that smartphone applications are a reliable and cost-effective tool for data collection in teaching the scientific method and performing physiology activities. The cardiac rhythm dance (CRD) protocol engages students in dancing a cardiac cyclelike movement to the rhythm of classical, pop, and samba music, and measuring their own cardiac frequency. Students collected their own data using the app Instant Heart Rate (Azumio). The CRD protocol allowed students to conclude that cardiac cycle-like movements paced by a pop song could represent the normal cardiac rhythm, whereas a classical song induced a significant reduction of heart rate, and the samba song significantly increased heart rate compared with the pop song. After group discussion, students considered that the pop rhythm is more realistic of day-by-day movement rhythms and is equivalent to the steady state of daily cardiac rhythms. Students considered the bradycardic and tachycardic movements to the dancing performed to the classical and samba rhythms, respectively. Thus the CRD protocol provides a multiple sensory-based and active learning resource that can engage students in learning cardiovascular physiology and recognizes smartphones as scientific instruments for collecting data during hands-on activities.

AB In the veterinary professional curriculum, methods of examination in many courses are transitioning from the traditional paper-based exams to electronic-based exams. Therefore, a controlled trial to evaluate the impact of testing methodology on examination performance in a veterinary physiology course was designed and implemented. Formalized surveys and focus group discussions were also used to determine student attitudes toward the examination formats. In total, 134 first-year veterinary students and 11 PhD/MS students were administered a total of 4 exams throughout 1 semester (2 on paper and 2 electronically) using a split-halves design. The paper (P) and electronic (E) exams contained 25 identical multiple-choice questions. Students were randomly assigned to two groups and were given exams in one of two sequences (E-P-E-P or P-E-P-E). Participants consented to and completed two anonymous surveys vis a vis their experience. Out of a maximum raw score of 25, the mean score for electronic examinations (20.8; 95% confidence interval, 20.3-21.2) was significantly (P = 0.01) greater than that for paper examinations (20.3; 95% confidence interval, 20.0-20.7). However, students expressed numerous concerns with the electronic examination format, and, at the completion of the study, 87% preferred to take their examination on paper rather than the electronic format. These data show that student attitudes concerning the examination format are not primarily determined by examination results, and that the additional anxiety related to the electronic examination format plays a large role in student attitudes.

AB Flipped classroom is a hybrid educational format that shifts guided teaching out of class, thus allowing class time for student-centered learning. Although this innovative teaching format is gaining attention, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of flipped teaching on student performance. We compared student performance and student attitudes toward flipped teaching with that of traditional lectures using a partial flipped study design. Flipped teaching expected students to have completed preclass material, such as assigned reading, instructor-prepared lecture video(s), and PowerPoint slides. In-class activities included the review of difficult topics, a modified team-based learning (TBL) session, and an individual assessment. In the unflipped teaching format, students were given PowerPoint slides and reading assignment before their scheduled lectures. The class time consisted of podium-style lecture, which was captured in real time and was made available for students to use as needed. Comparison of student performance between flipped and unflipped teaching showed that flipped teaching improved student performance by 17.5%. This was true of students in both the upper and lower half of the class. A survey conducted during this study indicated that 65% of the students changed the way they normally studied, and 69% of the students believed that they were more prepared for class with flipped learning than in the unflipped class. These findings suggest that flipped teaching, combined with TBL, is more effective than the traditional lecture.

AB Integrating medical ethics into the physiology teaching-learning program has been largely unexplored in India. The objective of this exercise was to introduce an interactive and integrated ethics program into the Physiology course of first-year medical students and to evaluate their perceptions. Sixty medical students (30 men, 30 women) underwent 11 sessions over a 7-mo period. Two of the Physiology faculty conducted these sessions (20-30 min each) during the routine physiology (theory/practicals) classes that were of shorter duration and could, therefore, accommodate the discussion of related ethical issues. This exercise was in addition to the separate ethics classes conducted by the Medical Ethics department. The sessions were open ended, student centered, and designed to stimulate critical thinking. The students' perceptions were obtained through a semistructured questionnaire and focused group discussions. The students found the program unique, thought provoking, fully integrated, and relevant. It seldom interfered with the physiology teaching. They felt that the program sensitized them about ethical issues and prepared them for their clinical years, to be "ethical doctors." Neutral observers who evaluated each session felt that the integrated program was relevant to the preclinical year and that the program was appropriate in its content, delivery, and student involvement. An ethics course taught in integration with Physiology curriculum was found to be beneficial, feasible, and compatible with Physiology by students as well as neutral observers.

AB The goal of this review is to highlight key elements underpinning excellent high-stakes summative assessment. This guide is primarily aimed at faculty members with the responsibility of assigning student grades and is intended to be a practical tool to help throughout the process of planning, developing, and deploying tests as well as monitoring their effectiveness. After a brief overview of the criteria for high-quality assessment, the guide runs through best practices for aligning assessment with learning outcomes and compares common testing modalities. Next, the guide discusses the kind of validity evidence needed to support defensible grading of student performance. This review concentrates on how to measure the outcome of student learning; other reviews in this series will expand on the related concepts of formative testing and how to leverage testing for learning.

AB Advances in science education research have the potential to improve the way students learn to perform scientific interpretations and understand science concepts. We developed active, collaborative activities to teach skills in manipulating flow cytometry data using FlowJo software. Undergraduate students were given compensated clinical flow cytometry listmode output (FCS) files and asked to design a gating strategy to diagnose patients with different hematological malignancies on the basis of their immunophenotype. A separate cohort of research trainees was given uncompensated data files on which they performed their own compensation, calculated the antibody staining index, designed a sequential gating strategy, and quantified rare immune cell subsets. Student engagement, confidence, and perceptions of flow cytometry were assessed using a survey. Competency against the learning outcomes was assessed by asking students to undertake tasks that required understanding of flow cytometry dot plot data and gating sequences. The active, collaborative approach allowed students to achieve learning outcomes not previously possible with traditional teaching formats, for example, having students design their own gating strategy, without forgoing essential outcomes such as the interpretation of dot plots. In undergraduate students, favorable perceptions of flow cytometry as a field and as a potential career choice were correlated with student confidence but not the ability to perform flow cytometry data analysis. We demonstrate that this new pedagogical approach to teaching flow cytometry is beneficial for student understanding and interpretation of complex concepts. It should be considered as a useful new method for incorporating complex data analysis tasks such as flow cytometry into curricula.

AB The present study aimed to provide undergraduate medical students at Melaka Manipal Medical College (Manipal Campus), Manipal University, in Karnataka, India, an opportunity to apply their knowledge in cardiovascular concepts to real-life situations. A group activity named "Heart Shots" was implemented for a batch of first-year undergraduate students (n = 105) at the end of a block (teaching unit). Students were divided into 10 groups each having 10-11 students. They were requested to make a video/PowerPoint presentation about the application of cardiovascular principles to real-life situations. The presentation was required to be of only pictures/photos and no text material, with a maximum duration of 7 min. More than 95% of students considered that the activity helped them to apply their knowledge in cardiovascular concepts to real-life situations and understand the relevance of physiology in medicine and to revise the topic. More than 90% of students agreed that the activity helped them to apply their creativity in improving their knowledge and to establish a link between concepts rather than learning them as isolated facts. Based on the feedback, we conclude that the activity was student centered and that it facilitated learning.

AB The objectives of the present study were to 1) assess student attitudes to physiology, 2) evaluate student opinions about the influence of an objective structured practical examination (OSPE) on competence, and 3) assess the validity and reliability of an indigenously designed feedback questionnaire. A structured questionnaire containing 16 item statements, 8 items on an Osgood's 5-point semantic differential scale and 8 items on a Likert's 5-point scale, was used. Options were assigned scores of 1-5 according to weightage. For Osgood's semantic differential scale items, a = 2-test was done to analyze student attitudes toward the subject. For Likert scale items, mean score and SD were calculated to analyze student opinions of the OSPE. Item validity was assessed by item analysis, and reliability was assessed by calculating Crohnbach's =. The subject as a whole was interesting to 82% of the students (n = 135). The theory was interesting to 75% of the students (n = 132) but complex to 42% (n = 118). The practical was interesting to 93% of the students (n = 134); 76% of the students (n = 104) felt that the practical was simple, whereas 4% felt it was complex. The OSPE was interesting to 79% of the students (n = 131); 57% of the students (n = 116) felt it was simple, whereas 24% found it complex. Components of the subject, intricateness, and student interests were strongly associated. Students chose options on a higher weight scale, favoring the OSPE. Items were found to be valid and reliable. In conclusion, the subject of physiology was interesting but not simple to understand. Student interests varied with the components of the subject, and the components of the subject had varied intricateness. Students were in favor of the OSPE for assessment. The questionnaire used for the study was valid and reliable.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

AB Team-based learning (TBL) is an interactive and analytic teaching strategy. TBL is a learner-centered strategy that uses a very structured individual and group accountability process and requires small groups to work together to solve problems. This study served to investigate whether the TBL concept could be modified and adopted to the fifth-year cornea module of an ophthalmology course. Questionnaires (using a Likert scale of 1-5) were distributed to 169 fifth-year medical students attending the cornea module applied as TBL in an ophthalmology course. The questionnaire consisted of two categories: the TBL format (7 items) and an open-ended question about the class (1 item). Feedback was then evaluated. The majority of students felt that modified TBL sessions were better at fulfilling learning objectives (121 students, 71.59%), enabled better understanding (134 students, 79.28%), were more interesting (146 students, 86.39%), ensured greater student participation (123 students, 72.78%), and involved greater effort on the part of students (148 students, 87.57%) compared with traditional teaching methods. Most of the students (129 students, 76.33%) agreed that more such sessions should be organized in the future. In conclusion, after adjustments to improve weaknesses, such as the short time allocation and students' lack of prior background, the outcomes of this modified TBL approach on the cornea module of an ophthalmology course provide a good basis for its continuation.

Adv Physiol Educ 37: 97-105, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00087.2012.-Gas exchange in animals is ultimately diffusion based, generally occurring across dedicated respiratory organs. In many aquatic amphibians, however, multiple modes of gas exchange exist, allowing for the partitioning of O-2 uptake and CO2 excretion between respiratory organs with different efficiencies. For example, due to the physical properties of O-2 being vastly different between air and water phases, the lung and skin play disproportionately important roles in O-2 uptake. Many aquatic frogs are renowned for their cutaneous gas exchange capacity, where often the majority of CO2 is excreted across the skin. Furthermore, the roles of these gas exchange organs change with the animal's behavior. Under diving conditions, most of the frog's gas exchange needs must be met by the skin. In this article, we describe an interactive undergraduate laboratory that allows a class of students to share equipment while assessing pulmonary and cutaneous respiration in frogs provided with an air/water choice and under enforced dive conditions. Concepts explored in this laboratory exercise include animal energetics, diving reflex, pulmonary and cutaneous gas exchange processes, diffusion-based gas flux, and O-2 debt.

ID MULTIPLE-CHOICE; TRUE-FALSE
AB THE ANNUAL Intermedical School Physiology Quiz (IMSPQ), initiated in 2003, is now an event that attracts a unique, large gathering of selected medical students from medical schools across the globe, as previously described in this journal (4). The 8th IMSPQ, in 2010, hosted by the Department of Physiology, University of Malaya, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, had 200 students representing 41 medical schools from 14 countries participating in the annual quiz, in which two-thirds were overseas teams, including 4 teams from China and teams from 5 Indonesian universities and 5 Thai universities (Table 1). Newly competing teams from Romania, Europe, and Saudi Arabia also participated in the 8th IMSPQ. The challenge trophy for the IMSPQ is named in honor of the late Professor A. Raman, who was the first Malaysian Professor of Physiology at the University of Malaya.
   From this international sample of medical students, we were interested in observing some of the common mistakes that were made by a significant portion of these students. We report here some illuminating insights gleaned from this international physiology quiz event. This report also highlights some common misconceptions among students of physiology, as has been previously described in definite studies by others (5, 8, 10, 13, 14).

AB Ramjiawan B, Pierce GN, Anindo MI, AlKukhun A, Alshammari A, Chamsi AT, Abousaleh M, Alkhani A, Ganguly PK. An international basic science and clinical research summer program for medical students. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 27-33, 2012; doi: 10.1152/advan.00056.2011.-An important part of training the next generation of physicians is ensuring that they are exposed to the integral role that research plays in improving medical treatment. However, medical students often do not have sufficient time to be trained to carry out any projects in biomedical and clinical research. Many medical students also fail to understand and grasp translational research as an important concept today. In addition, since medical training is often an international affair whereby a medical student/resident/fellow will likely train in many different countries during his/her early training years, it is important to provide a learning environment whereby a young medical student experiences the unique challenges and value of an international educational experience. This article describes a program that bridges the gap between the basic and clinical research concepts in a unique international educational experience. After completing two semester curricula at Alfaisal University in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, six medical students undertook a summer program at St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre, in Winnipeg, MB, Canada. The program lasted for 2 mo and addressed advanced training in basic science research topics in medicine such as cell isolation, functional assessment, and molecular techniques of analysis and manipulation as well as sessions on the conduct of clinical research trials, ethics, and intellectual property management. Programs such as these are essential to provide a base from which medical students can decide if research is an attractive career choice for them during their clinical practice in subsequent years. An innovative international summer research course for medical students is necessary to cater to the needs of the medical students in the 21st century.

AB Fry JR, Burr SA. A double-blind atropine trial for active learning of autonomic function. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 438-444, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00075.2011.-Here, we describe a human physiology laboratory class measuring changes in autonomic function over time in response to atropine. Students use themselves as subjects, generating ownership and self-interest in the learning as well as directly experiencing the active link between physiology and pharmacology in people. The class is designed to concomitantly convey the importance of bias in experimentation by adopting a double-blind placebo-controlled approach. We have used this class effectively in various forms with similar to 600 students receiving atropine over the last 16 yr. This class has received favorable feedback from staff and students of medicine, pharmacy, and neuroscience, and we recommend it for such undergraduates. The learning objectives that students are expected to achieve are to be able to 1) know the ethical, safety, and hygiene requirements for using human volunteers as subjects; 2) implement and explain a double-blind placebo-controlled trial; 3) design, agree, and execute a protocol for making (and accurately recording) precise reproducible measurements of pulse rate, pupil diameter, and salivary flow; 4) evaluate the importance of predose periods and measurement consistency to detect effects (including any reversibility) after an intervention; 5) experience direct cause-and-effect relationships integrating physiology with pharmacology in people; 6) calculate appropriate summary statistics to describe the data and determine the data's statistical significance; 7) recognize normal variability both within and between subjects in baseline physiological parameters and also recognize normal variability in response to pharmacological treatment; 8) infer the distribution and role of muscarinic receptors in the autonomic nervous system with respect to the heart, eye, and mouth; 9) identify and explain the clinical significance of differences in effect due to the route and formulation of atropine; 10) produce and deliver a concise oral presentation of experimental findings; and 11) produce a written report in the form of a short scientific research article. The results of a typical study are presented, which demonstrate that the administration of atropine by a subcutaneous injection elicited a significant increase in pulse rate and pupil diameter and a significant decrease in salivary flow, whereas administration of atropine in an oral liquid elicited significant effects on pulse rate and salivary flow, and an oral solid format elicited a significant alteration in salivary flow alone. More detailed analysis of the salivary flow data demonstrated clear differences between the routes of administration and formulation in the onset and magnitude of action of atropine.

TI GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR RESEARCH INVOLVING ANIMALS AND HUMAN BEINGS
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The research described in papers submitted to any of the APS publications that involve the use of human beings must adhere to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Title 45, U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects, Revised November 13, 2001, effective December 13, 2001 (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm). Research involving animals must adhere to APS's Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals. APS insists that all investigations involving humans or animals reported in its publications be conducted in conformity with these principles and that a statement of protocol approval from an IRB or IACUC or equivalent is included in the methods section of the paper. In describing surgical procedures, the type and dosage of the anesthetic agent should be specified. Curarizing agents are not anesthetics; if these are used, evidence must be provided that anesthesia of suitable grade and duration was employed. Editors/Associate Editors are expected to refuse papers in which evidence of the adherence to these principles is not apparent. They reserve the right to judge the appropriateness of the use of animals and humans in experiments published in the journals. Differences of opinion will be adjudicated by the Publications Committee.

AB Anjur SS. Student-centered physiology in high schools. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 161-167, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00076.2010.-Student test score percentages in the Physiology and Disease (PAD) course at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, a high school for students of the state of Illinois gifted in math and science, were studied over a period of 5 yr. Inquiry-based laboratory experiences in the course were slowly converted during this time from partly student centered and mostly teacher led to completely student centered beginning in fall 2008. Quarterly analysis of the effect of increased inquiry upon average weekly report submissions of 400 students over 4 yr showed a significant improvement in submission (P < 0.0002) between quarters 1 and 2 and also improvement from year to year between the academic years of 2006/2007 and 2009/2010 (P < 0.0001). A comparison of student test score percentages from 346 students in 4 major tests showed a significant increase (P = 0.0125) beginning in the academic year of 2008/2009, when the conversion of all laboratories in the course from partly student centered to completely student centered was concluded compared with scores over the 2 yr from 2006/2007 up to this point. There was also a significant difference (P < 00001) in test score percentages between the individual tests themselves over the 4 yr studied. Taking the study a step further, the 35 students registered in the two PAD classes offered in the fall 2010 semester were divided in each of their classes into student-centered and teacher-centered groups, with the former designing all their experiments and the latter following instructions from the teacher. Student score percentages on specific test questions from the four major tests that focused on transfer of student understanding were compared between these two groups. There was a significant improvement (P = 0.012) when students designed their own laboratories (student-centered group) compared with doing what the teacher asked (teacher-centered group). There was also a significant difference between these student score percentages among the individual tests (P < 0.0001). These data suggest that an increase in student-centered experiments may lead to a corresponding increase in test performance on questions involving student transfer.

AB Kearns KD, Sullivan CS. Resources and practices to help graduate students and postdoctoral fellows write statements of teaching philosophy. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 136-145, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00123.2010.-Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows currently encounter requests for a statement of teaching philosophy in at least half of academic job announcements in the United States. A systematic process for the development of a teaching statement is required that integrates multiple sources of support, informs writers of the document's purpose and audience, helps writers produce thoughtful statements, and encourages meaningful reflection on teaching and learning. This article for faculty mentors and instructional consultants synthesizes practices for mentoring graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty members as they prepare statements of teaching philosophy. We review background information on purposes and audiences, provide writing resources, and synthesize empirical research on the use of teaching statements in academic job searches. In addition, we integrate these resources into mentoring processes that have helped graduate students in a Health Sciences Pedagogy course to collaboratively and critically examine and write about their teaching. This summary is intended for faculty mentors and instructional consultants who want to refine current resources or establish new mentoring programs. This guide also may be useful to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty members, especially those who lack mentoring or who seek additional resources, as they consider the many facets of effective teaching.

AB Matsuo O, Takahashi Y, Abe C, Tanaka K, Nakashima A, Morita H. Trial of integrated laboratory practice. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 237-240, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00047.2010.-In most laboratory practices for students in medical schools, a laboratory guidebook is given to the students, in which the procedures are precisely described. The students merely follow the guidebook without thinking deeply, which spoils the students and does not entice them to think creatively. Problem-based learning (PBL) could be one means for the students themselves to actively learn, find problems, and resolve them. Such a learning attitude nurtures medical students with lifelong learning as healthcare professionals. We merged PBL and laboratory practices to promote deep thinking habits and developed an integrated laboratory practice. We gave a case sheet to groups of students from several schools. The students raised hypotheses after vivid discussion, designed experimental protocols, and performed the experiments. If the results did not support or disproved the hypothesis, the students set up another hypothesis followed by experiments, lasting for 4 or 5 consecutive days. These procedures are quite similar to those of professional researchers. The main impact achieved was the fact that the students developed the experimental design by themselves, for the first time in their college lives. All students enjoyed the laboratory practice, which they had never experienced before. This is an antidote to the guidebook-navigated traditional laboratory practice, which disappoints many students. As educators in basic medical sciences stand on the edge in terms of educating the next generation, there is a need to provide a strong foundation for medical students to design and perform scientific experiments. The integrated laboratory practice may provide the solution.

AB Curran-Everett D. Explorations in statistics: correlation. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 186-191, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00068.2010.-Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This sixth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores correlation, a familiar technique that estimates the magnitude of a straight-line relationship between two variables. Correlation is meaningful only when the two variables are true random variables: for example, if we restrict in some way the variability of one variable, then the magnitude of the correlation will decrease. Correlation cannot help us decide if changes in one variable result in changes in the second variable, if changes in the second variable result in changes in the first variable, or if changes in a third variable result in concurrent changes in the first two variables. Correlation can help provide us with evidence that study of the nature of the relationship between x and y may be warranted in an actual experiment in which one of them is controlled.

AB McNulty JA, Gruener G, Chandrasekhar A, Espiritu B, Hoyt A, Ensminger D. Are online student evaluations of faculty influenced by the timing of evaluations?. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 213-216, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00079.2010.-Student evaluations of faculty are important components of the medical curriculum and faculty development. To improve the effectiveness and timeliness of student evaluations of faculty in the physiology course, we investigated whether evaluations submitted during the course differed from those submitted after completion of the course. A secure web-based system was developed to collect student evaluations that included numerical rankings (1-5) of faculty performance and a section for comments. The grades that students received in the course were added to the data, which were sorted according to the time of submission of the evaluations and analyzed by Pearson's correlation and Student's t-test. Only 26% of students elected to submit evaluations before completion of the course, and the average faculty ratings of these evaluations were highly correlated [r(14) = 0.91] with the evaluations submitted after completion of the course. Faculty evaluations were also significantly correlated with the previous year [r(14) = 0.88]. Concurrent evaluators provided more comments that were statistically longer and subjectively scored as more "substantive." Students who submitted their evaluations during the course and who included comments had significantly higher final grades in the course. In conclusion, the numeric ratings that faculty received were not influenced by the timing of student evaluations. However, students who submitted early evaluations tended to be more engaged as evidenced by their more substantive comments and their better performance on exams. The consistency of faculty evaluations from year to year and concurrent versus at the end of the course suggest that faculty tend not to make significant adjustments to student evaluations.

AB This article will detail the development and implementation of an introductory course using the "core concepts." Specifics of course design, assessment, and challenges encountered will be presented for those interested in this approach.
   As one element of an extensive revision to program curriculum, the Integrative Physiology and Health Science Department at a small, private, liberal arts institution developed a novel introductory course for the major, focusing specifically on the "core concepts" of physiology. Intended to provide the initial step in explicit scaffolding for student success and, ultimately, transfer of knowledge across the curriculum, development and assessment of the first offering of the course were completed. In the fall of 2021, IPH 131: Foundations in Physiology was launched. The specific core concepts covered were as follows: causality, scientific reasoning, physics/chemistry, structure-function, homeostasis, flow-down gradients, cell membrane, energy, cell-cell communication, and interdependence/integration. To assess student learning, the Phys-MAPS (Measuring Achievement and Progress in Science for Physiology) assessment tool was administered to students during the first week of class and again in the final week of the semester. Average scores revealed significant learning gains by the end of the semester (0.497 & PLUSMN; 0.058 vs. 0.538 & PLUSMN; 0.108 correct as a proportion of the total number of questions, P = 0.0096). While a modest gain in learning outcomes, these data provide early evidence that a course specifically addressing the core concepts of physiology can be an appropriate introduction to the physiology curriculum.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article will detail the development and implementation of an introductory course using the "core concepts." Specifics of course design, assessment, and challenges encountered will be presented for those interested in this approach.

AB The online flipped classroom (OFC) has emerged as a new teaching method in universities worldwide, which combines asynchronous and synchronous online learning. OFC differs from the traditional flipped classroom as it does not involve face-to-face interaction between teachers and students. Instead, the class meeting is conducted online, and it is focused on active and collaborative learning (e.g., discussion rather than lecturing). To evaluate the effectiveness of the Physiology OFC, we compared it with online live teaching (OLT) offered in the same school and semester. We analyzed the exam scores of the Physiology course as well as the scores for other courses offered in the same semester and after the Physiology course. We categorized the top 27% of the exam takers as high-achieving students and the bottom 27% as low-achieving students. Our analysis found no statistically significant difference between OFC and OLT in terms of overall exam scores for all students. However, high-achieving students in OFC scored higher on the total exam score and short answer questions, but the score of case study questions (CSQs) of low-achieving students was lower. Furthermore, students in OFC scored higher in Medical Immunology and courses dominated by logical thinking such as Pharmacology and Diagnostics than students in OLT. In conclusion, our findings suggest that OFC can achieve the same teaching effectiveness as OLT, with a more positive impact on high-achieving students. The positive impact extends beyond the Physiology course to other courses where logical thinking is critical. However, the lower performance of low-achieving students in CSQs highlights the need for further research to determine the reasons for their lower performance and potential strategies to improve their learning outcomes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY An online flipped classroom approach achieved the same teaching effect as online live teaching but had a more positive impact on high-achieving students. The positive impact was not only in Physiology but also in subsequent courses where logical thinking prevailed. However, for low-achieving students, the effect of online live teaching was better.

AB Using real-world situations to engage students in learning specific content is advocated by educational research as an effective strategy. However, motivating students to establish personal and emotional connections with the curricular content is challenging. We presented a didactic strategy named "the presidential election of the human body," created to use the presidential election context to engage students in studying cell function and structure using role-playing and appropriation of scientific concepts. Four groups of students (n = 124) of the science and mathematics teacher training program chose a cell of the human body to impersonate, they studied the biology of their cell, and they ran in a presidential election campaign. They created slogans, videos, and materials for their campaign, and on the day of the election the group of students voted for the best slogan. The didactic strategy was capable of stimulating the appropriation of the characteristics of the cells they represented. The majority (75%) of the elected candidates represented cells that are linked to the nervous system. Musicality and humor were the most frequent styles that appeared in the slogans. Students strongly agreed that they enjoyed the activity and considered it valuable for contextualizing the learning of anatomy and physiology. Thus, the activity is a didactic resource to stimulate the students to embrace the content they are learning in the contextualized momentum of a presidential election.

AB This study proposes a hands-on activity as an experimental alternative method to teach biomedical engineering students the osmosis phenomenon. The students were guided along a learning path that involved their participation in the design and construction of a test device used to measure osmotic flow rate. Thereafter, an experiment was conducted with the test device. The students analyzed the obtained experimental values, which provided them with evidence of the functionality of the device. In addition, they were provided with the opportunity to suggest improvements and to propose alternatives to expand the use of the device to test other transport phenomena such as diffusion. Moreover, a student perception survey was conducted, and the results showed that this proposed plan allows for a better understanding of the phenomenon and stimulates the curiosity of students, improving the receptiveness, key in the learning process of the students.

AB Homeostasis is a core concept in systems physiology that future clinicians and biomedical professionals will apply in their careers. Despite this, many students struggle to transfer the principles governing homeostasis to concrete examples. Precourse assessments conducted on 72 undergraduate biology students enrolled in an introductory systems physiology course at the University of Belgrade during the February-May semester of 2021 revealed that students had a vague, fragmentary understanding of homeostasis and its related concepts that was often conflated with topics touched on during their previous coursework. We formalized and implemented an approach to teaching homeostasis that focused heavily on consistent reinforcement of physiological reflex patterns throughout the course. To that end, we employed a variety of activities aimed at getting students to view organ system integration holistically. After the semester, postcourse assessment demonstrated that students were better able to provide concrete examples of organ system contributions to homeostasis and were more adept at applying basic principles to novel physiological scenarios. Comparison of final grades with previous semesters revealed that students outperformed their peers who had taken the course previously. In this article, we summarize the findings of pre- and postcourse assessments, describe the general approach we took to teaching homeostasis as well as the specific techniques used in the classroom, and compare student performance with previous semesters.

AB We introduced the AliveCor KardiaMobile electrocardiogram (ECG), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, iPad-enabled medical device, into the preclerkship curriculum to demonstrate the clinical relevance of cardiac electrophysiology with active learning. An evaluation showed that medical students considered the KardiaMobile ECG active learning activity to be a valuable educational tool for teaching cardiac physiology.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

ID PRINCIPLES; PHYSIOLOGY
AB The laboratory practical reported here is based in Poiseuille's law and utilizes low-cost laboratory consumable items, thereby making it easy to deploy in any teaching laboratory. In the practical, students take an experimental approach of individually changing physical variables and measuring fluid flow rates. Plotting these results allows them to discuss the effect each variable has on flow. Furthermore, students enhance their appreciation of experimental errors and variability by making repeat measurements. In the follow-up teaching session, the students are encouraged to apply their experimental findings to the cardiovascular system and the control of blood flow both at rest and under conditions of altered cardiac output, such as during exercise. By tackling the topic of flow control as a core concept, it allows the students to then apply their understanding in wider physiological contexts, such as airflow in the respiratory system.

   INDEXES; MUSCLE MECHANICS; LEFT ATRIAL; HEART; LAW
AB Preload has been variously defined, but if there is to be a direct relationship with activity of the Frank-Starling mechanism in its action to increase the force and extent of contraction, preload must directly reflect myocardial stretch. The Frank-Starling mechanism is activated during any stretch of a cardiac chamber beyond its resting size, which is present immediately before contraction. Every left ventricle has an intrinsic and limited range of possible volumes at end diastole. There is a curvilinear relationship between left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and, at maximal or near maximal LVEDV, there will be a high LVEDP. Within the possible range, the LVEDV will be determined by the extent of filling, any change in LVEDV will result in changed activity of the Frank-Starling mechanism, and change in LVEDV might, therefore, be considered to represent change in preload. On the other hand, it is the difference between the current and the maximal possible LVEDV (or the preload reserve) that may be of the most clinical relevance. There is a reciprocal relationship between preload and preload reserve, with minor or absent LV preload reserve indicating that there will be either minimal or no increase in stroke volume following intravenous fluid administration. As left atrial pressure can remain within the normal range when the LVEDP is elevated, it is LVEDP, and not left atrial pressure, that provides the most reliable guide to preload reserve in an individual at a specific period in time.

AB Good presentation skills are important. Why? When you improve your presentation skills, you improve your ability to engage your audience and communicate whatever science you happen to do. In graduate school you learn how to do research, and you sometimes learn how to teach, but how often do you actually learn how to give an effective, engaging presentation? In this PERSONAL VIEW I recount some of my early experiences as a presenter and some of the techniques I use to (hopefully) engage my audiences.

AB Medical programs are under pressure to maintain currency with scientific and technical advances, as well as prepare graduates for clinical work and a wide range of postgraduate careers. The value of the basic sciences in primary medical education was assessed by exploring the perceived clinical relevance and test performance trends among medical students, interns, residents, and experienced clinicians. A pilot study conducted in 2014 involved administration of a voluntary 60-item multiple-choice question test to 225 medical students and 4 interns. These participants and 26 teaching clinicians rated the items for clinical relevance. In 2016, a similarly constructed test (main study) was made a mandatory formative assessment, attempted by 563 students in years 2, 4, and 6 and by 120 commencing general practice residents. Test scores, performance trends, clinical relevance ratings. and correlations were assessed using relevant parametric and nonparametric tests. Rank order and pass-fail decisions were also reviewed. The mean test scores were 57% (SD 7.1) and 52% (SD 6.1) for the pilot and main studies. respectively. Highest scores were observed in pathology and social sciences. Overall performance increased with increasing year of study. Test scores were positively correlated with perceived relevance. There were moderate correlations (r = 0.50-0.63; P < 0.001) between participants' scores in the basic science and summative exams. Assessments may be key to fostering relevance and integration of the basic sciences. Benchmarking knowledge retention and result comparisons across topics are useful in program evaluation.

AB The aim of this work is to describe the "Muscular System Game," created to assist in the teaching-learning process concerning the physiology of the muscular system, and to evaluate its effect on the learning of university students. Participating in this study were first-year undergraduate students of the pharmacy course (game group, n = 21, 5 men and 16 women, age 23.57 +/- 4.92 yr) and the nursing course (control group, n = 22, 2 men and 20 women, age 22.90 +/- 4.93 yr), who had the same level of preparation. After theoretical classes concerning the physiology of the muscular system, all students were instructed to study the topic. In the next week, the students of the game group performed the activity with the board game, and the students of the control group undertook a guided study activity, which contained a list of exercises with the same questions used in the game, to be answered by groups. In the week following these activities, all of the students answered evaluation questions about the topic. The scores obtained for the two groups in the evaluation were compared using Student's t-test for unpaired samples, considering a significance level of 0.05. The score obtained for the control group (5.78 +/- 0.38) was significantly lower than the score for the game group (7.50 +/- 0.47; P < 0.05). The results obtained indicating that the use of an educational board game about the physiology of muscle contraction resulted in significantly improved learning, compared with the use of guided study.

AB Misconceptions about physiology are a major threat to accurate scientific and clinical reasoning in medical education. Awareness is often mentioned as a prerequisite to achieve conceptual understanding: however, students are frequently unaware of their incorrect understanding. We explored the multitier approach as a tool to obtain insight into students' awareness and misconceptions regarding cardiovascular physiology. Biomedical sciences students (N = 81) participated in a diagnostic multitier assessment on cardiovascular physiology. Each question consisted of an answer tier and an explanation tier. Both tiers were paired with confidence tiers, i.e., 5-point Likert scales, which were used as an indicator for metacognitive evaluation. i.e., awareness. The average test score was 3.07 (maximum 4.0) for the answer tier only, and reduced to 1.57 when answer and explanation tiers were combined. A weak correlation (R-2 = 0.13, P = 0.001) between students' confidence and their test scores was found for the combined responses. Correct combined answers were associated with an increase in confidence score of 0.27 vs. incorrect answers. Using a Bland-Altman analysis, we showed that students generally overestimated their knowledge. In total, 28.7% of all responses were classified as misconceptions, defined as incorrect answers paired with high confidence. In all, findings indicate that the multitier approach is useful to study students' conceptual understanding and uncover misconceptions on cardiovascular physiology. Furthermore, this study supports the need for metacognitive measures in order to improve teaching and learning in medical education.

AB An APS Teaching Section symposium entitled "Examining the Changing Landscape of Course Delivery and Student Learning" was offered at the Experimental Biology conference on April 24th, 2017, in Chicago, IL. The symposium focused on alternative delivery modes of physiology education, from undergraduate to professional programs. Lecture used to be the gold standard and proven method by which students learned, but the course delivery method is rapidly changing. While there is still significant skepticism about the quality and level of student engagement in online learning, it is being offered widely due to increased demand and due to other benefits, such as the flexibility and convenience. Universities with several campuses may now synchronize lectures between campuses, utilizing video conference technology, thus bypassing the need for instructors on each campus. Other modes of delivery include online lectures with laboratories scheduled on campus. Offering biology laboratories online is on the rise but to counter skepticism. more studies are needed to demonstrate that online laboratories effectively meet laboratory objectives. The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offers many courses for free and challenges the role of universities. Assessment of the effectiveness of MOOCs and online courses is critical, as some of the concerns raised about them include level of student engagement in learning and the social aspect of interaction with peers and faculty.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB In the field of medical education, it is possible to consider that the acquisition of professional competences can gain new contours when considering the use of active methodologies. It is important to analyze the perception of the students about the use of them in medical courses, as well as to reflect on their challenges and potentials. In the present study, a semistructured questionnaire of student perception was applied immediately after the execution of different types of active methodologies in the discipline of physiology in two medical courses. The results suggest a highly positive evaluation of the use of active methodologies by the student body of the two institutions. The students evaluated positively the application of the method (94.6%) and the perception about the learning (84.1%). On the other hand, when questioned about the substitution of the traditional expository method by the active methodologies, there was a tendency to the centrality of the answers, with 84.0% of the responses concentrated at positions 2, 3, and 4 on a scale of 1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum) on the Likert scale. There were no statistically significant differences when comparing variables of age. sex, and previous graduation. Although there was no consensus regarding the full replacement of traditional for active methodologies, one can conclude that the students' perception about the introduction of said methodologies in the teaching of physiology in medical courses is positive, regardless of the subgroups evaluated. These results encourage the insertion of these and other methodologies into medical courses.

AB This study compared the effect of a virtual laboratory. a living tissue laboratory, and a blended laboratory on student learning about the generation and conduction of neural action potentials and perceptions about life science. Sixty-three second-year medical students were randomly assigned to one of three groups (living tissue laboratory, virtual laboratory, and blended group). The students conducted the practical activity, and then they were given a postlaboratory quiz and an attitude survey. The blended group euthanized fewer animals and spent less time to finish the animal experiment than the living tissue group did. In the postlaboratory quiz, students who performed the virtual laboratory alone got significantly lower scores than students in the other two groups, and the blended group did not get better scores than the living tissue group. The attitude surveys showed that the virtual laboratory group had a lower perceived value of the science research and activity in which they participated than the other two groups did. Here, 77.8% of all students chose the blended style as the ideal teaching method for experiments. Our findings led us to believe that isolated use of the virtual laboratory in China is not the best practice: the virtual laboratory serves as an effective preparation tool, and the blended laboratories may become the best laboratory teaching practice, provided that the software design for the virtual laboratory is further improved.

AB Academic self-concept is one's perception of his or her ability in an academic domain and is formed by comparing oneself to other students. As college biology classrooms transition from lecturing to active learning, students interact more with each other and are likely comparing themselves more to other students in the class. Student characteristics can impact students' academic self-concept; however, this has been unexplored in the context of undergraduate biology. In this study, we explored whether student characteristics can affect academic self-concept in the context of an active learning college physiology course. Using a survey, students self-reported how smart they perceived themselves to be in the context of physiology relative to the whole class and relative to their groupmate, the student with whom they worked most closely in class. Using linear regression, we found that men and native English speakers had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to the whole class compared with women and nonnative English speakers. Using logistic regression, we found that men had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to their groupmate compared with women. Using constant comparison methods, we identified nine factors that students reported influenced how they determined whether they were more or less smart than their groupmate. Finally, we found that students were more likely to report participating more than their groupmate if they had a higher academic self-concept. These findings suggest that student characteristics can influence students' academic self-concept, which in turn may influence their participation in smallgroup discussion and their academic achievement in active learning classes.

AB The present study reports perceptions of first-year undergraduate medical students (n = 120), regarding modified directed self-learning (DSL) sessions in physiology. Students were provided with prereading assignments (faculty developed PowerPoint slides containing diagrams with incomplete labeling/flowcharts with missing steps) pertaining to the DSL topic 1 wk before the scheduled small-group DSL presentations. During DSL presentation sessions, which were facilitated by teachers, a few students individually presented learning objectives in the specified topic. Apart from that, students discussed answers for the questions in the prereading assignment. Students were also given an opportunity to use technology to support DSL, by way of involving them in Pecha Kucha (PK) talks. The impact of the modified DSL method was determined by requesting students to respond to a validated questionnaire. Frequency analysis of the responses revealed that >60% of students were positive about the modified DSL sessions improving their DSL, presentation, collaborative learning, and information retrieving skills. Students agreed that PK talks helped them to learn how to organize content (65%), present concise information (65.8%), and apply creativity (72.5%). Even though small in number, there were comments that the prereading assignments were useful for learning. The present study revealed that, even though students actively participated in modified DSL sessions, their perceptions on satisfaction and usefulness of the same toward achievement of various skills were not encouraging. The study generated significant results, which implies that undergraduate medical students should be oriented on the relevance of active learning strategies in their future studies.

ID EMBRYONIC DIAPAUSE
AB In this teaching laboratory, the students are directed in an exercise that involves designing and performing an experiment to determine estrogen's role in regulating delayed implantation (diapause) in female rats. To encourage active participation by the students, a discussion question is provided before the laboratory exercise in which each student is asked to search the literature and provide written answers to questions and to formulate an experiment to test the role of ovarian estrogen in inducing implantation in female rats. One week before the laboratory exercise, students discuss their answers to the questions with the instructor to develop an experiment to test their hypothesis that estrogen is involved with inducing implantation in the rat. A rat delayed implantation model was established that utilizes an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780), which inhibits the action of ovarian estrogens. Groups of mated females are treated with either carrier (control) or ICI 182,780 (ICI) every other day, starting on day 2 postcoitus (pc) until day 8 pc. One-half of the females receiving ICI are injected with estradiol-17 beta on day 8 pc to induce implantation 4 days after the controls. If the ICI-treated females are not administered estradiol, embryo implantation occurs spontaneously similar to 4 days after the last ICI injection on day 8. This is a very simple protocol that is very effective and provides an excellent experiment for student discussion on hormone action and the use of agonists and antagonists.

AB Because the heart and lungs are confined within the thoracic cavity, understanding their interactions is integral for studying each system. Such interactions include changes in external constraint to the heart, blood volume redistribution (venous return), direct ventricular interaction (DVI), and left ventricular (LV) afterload. During mechanical ventilation, these interactions can be amplified and result in reduced cardiac output. For example, increased intrathoracic pressure associated with mechanical ventilation can increase external constraint and limit ventricular diastolic filling and, therefore, output. Similarly, high intrathoracic pressures can alter blood volume distribution and limit diastolic filling of both ventricles while concomitantly increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to increased DVI, which may further limit LV filling. While LV afterload is generally considered to decrease with increased intrathoracic pressure, the question arises if the reduced LV afterload is primarily a consequence of a reduced LV preload. A thorough understanding of the interaction between the heart and lungs can be complicated but is essential for clinicians and health science students alike. In this teaching review, we have attempted to highlight the present understanding of certain salient aspects of cardiopulmonary physiology and pathophysiology, as well as provide a resource for multidisciplined health science educators and students.

AB This laboratory activity is designed to teach students how to measure forearm muscle blood flow (FBF) to describe the mechanisms of peripheral blood flow thermal regulation in healthy subjects. The cold pressor test (CPT) is the clinical procedure used in the experiment to induce arterial vasoconstriction. Strain-gauge plethysmography is applied on the patient's forearm to noninvasive monitor vasoconstriction effects on local blood perfusion and physiological parameters such as blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Patients with an altered peripheral vascular resistance (e.g., in hypertension) have different responses to the CPT from healthy subjects. To date, experimental evidence remains unexplained, as we do not know if the BP and HR increase is caused by a decrease in flow rate or an increase in peripheral vascular resistance during the test. To clarify this situation, we have to quantify the parameter we assume is being conditioned by the regulatory physiological intervention, i.e., peripheral vascular resistance. Peripheral vascular resistance quantification can be calculated as the ratio between muscle flow and mean arterial pressure. Students will learn how to apply the instrumental procedure to collect and analyze data before, during, and after the CPT and to describe the physiological responses of the peripheral vascular system to external stressors. They will also learn how to distinguish healthy from pathological responses on the basis of how sympathetic nervous system reactions influence the biomechanics of peripheral vessels.

AB A testing-based learning strategy is one that relies on the act of recalling (i.e., testing) information after exposure, and interleaving is a strategy in which the learning materials are presented in a serial order (e.g., texts 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3) versus a blocked order (e.g., texts 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3). Although both learning strategies have been thoroughly investigated, few studies have examined their additive effect with higher-order cognitive tasks such as the ability to identify themes across multiple texts, and none of those did so using physiology information. The purpose of the present study was to compare recall and thematic processing across five different physiology texts. Participants were randomly assigned to learn the texts using one of the following four learning strategies: 1) study-study-study (S-S-S) using a blocked order, 2) S-S-S using an interleaved order, 3) study-test-study (S-T-S) using a blocked order, and 4) S-T-S using an interleaved order. Over the course of the following week, the S-T-S groups had more stable recall of key text ideas compared with the S-S-S groups, and the S-T-S group had more stable recall of thematic information than the S-S-S group when interleaving was used as the presentation order.

ID EDUCATION; CONTEXT
AB Taste perception was the focus of an undergraduate course in the health sciences that bridged the sciences and humanities. A problem-based learning approach was used to study the biological issues, whereas the cultural transmutations of these molecular mechanisms were explored using a variety of resources (novels, cookbooks, and films). Multiple evaluation procedures were used: problem summaries and problem-solving exercises (tripartite problem-solving exercise) for the problem-based learning component and group tasks and individual exercises for the cultural issues. Self-selected groups chose specific tasks from a prescribed list of options (setting up a journal in molecular gastronomy, developing an electronic tongue, designing a restaurant for synesthetes, organizing a farmers' market, marketing a culinary tour, framing hedonic scales, exploring changing tastes through works of art or recipe books, and crafting beers for space travel). Individual tasks were selected from a menu of options (book reviews, film reviews, conversations, creative writing, and oral exams). A few guest lecturers (wine making, cultural anthropology, film analysis, and nutritional epidemiology) added more flavor. The course was rated highly for its learning value (8.5 +/- 1.2, n = 62) and helped students relate biological mechanisms to cultural issues (9.0 +/- 0.9, n = 62).

AB Student contributions to research have been shown to effectively reflect on their communication and critical thinking skills. Short-term research courses offer opportunities for medical students to advance their research experience in subsequent high-demanding long-term research opportunities. The purpose of the present study was to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a research-oriented series (ROS) on undergraduate students at Alfaisal University in Saudi Arabia. The ROS was designed to comprise eight sessions. Each session addressed core principles and the practice of research concepts and was based on theoretical morning sessions supplemented by afternoon practical sessions delivered by experienced senior medical students and faculty members. Students were assessed comprehensively by the end of the ROS. The series was conducted twice, and 35 students were involved each time. A total of 70 enrolled students (35 men and 35 women) with grade point averages of >3.5 and >3.5 were asked to fill out an anonymous, online, self-administered questionnaire assessing their perception of knowledge, skills, and confidence after attending the ROS and evaluating their senior peers. Ninety percent of the medical students responded to the online survey and rated the ROS highly in improving their research knowledge, skills, and confidence. Male students reported significant gains compared with their female peers (P < 0.05). Grade point averages did not play a role in student gains after attending the ROS. Qualitative responses were in support of three recurring themes favoring the unique learning environment in the ROS. In conclusion, the ROS offers a short-term systematic approach to fundamental steps and concepts of biomedical research.

AB The ability to understand and implement calculations required for molarity and dilution computations that are routinely undertaken in the laboratory are essential skills that should be possessed by all students entering an undergraduate Life Sciences degree. However, it is increasingly recognized that the majority of these students are ill equipped to reliably carry out such calculations. There are several factors that conspire against students' understanding of this topic, with the alien concept of the mole in relation to the mass of compounds and the engineering notation required when expressing the relatively small quantities typically involved being two key examples. In this report, we highlight teaching methods delivered via revision workshops to undergraduate Life Sciences students at the University of Nottingham. Workshops were designed to 1) expose student deficiencies in basic numeracy skills and remedy these deficiencies, 2) introduce molarity and dilution calculations and illustrate their workings in a step-by-step manner, and 3) allow students to appreciate the magnitude of numbers. Preworkshop to postworkshop comparisons demonstrated a considerable improvement in students' performance, which attenuated with time. The findings of our study suggest that an ability to carry out laboratory calculations cannot be assumed in students entering Life Sciences degrees in the United Kingdom but that explicit instruction in the form of workshops improves proficiency to a level of competence that allows students to prosper in the laboratory environment.

AB Infection by pathogenic microbes initiates a set of complex interactions between the pathogen and the host mediated by pattern recognition receptors. Innate immune responses play direct roles in host defense during the early stages of infection, and they also exert a profound influence on the generation of the adaptive immune responses that ensue. An improved understanding of the pattern recognition receptors that mediate innate responses and their downstream effects after receptor ligation has the potential to lead to new ways to improve vaccines and prevent autoimmunity. This review focuses on the control of innate immune activation and the role that innate immune receptors play in helping to maintain tissue homeostasis.

TI The effectiveness of separating theory and practicum as a conduit to
   learning physiology
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION

DE physiology theory; physiology practicum; physiology teaching
ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION
AB Many conventional science courses contain subjects embedded with laboratory-based activities. However, research on the benefits of positioning the practicals within the theory subject or developing them distinctly from the theory is largely absent. This report compared results in a physiology theory subject among three different cohorts of students: those taking the theory subject alone, those taking it concurrent with a physiology practicum subject, and those who previously took the subject when it had practicums embedded within the one subject. The path model shows that students taking both physiology theory and physiology practicum attained a significantly higher result in online tests compared with those who took the theory subject alone (P < 0.05) and that this translated to a significantly higher result in the end-of-semester examination. Similarly, students taking both physiology theory and the physiology practicum attained a significantly higher end-examination result compared with those who took the physiology subject in previous years when the practicums were embedded within the theory subject (P < 0.05). In both cases, this increase was largely attained in components that tested critical thinking and deep learning (short theory application questions and extended written questions). We conclude that students undertaking both physiology theory and the physiology practicum most likely performed better in the theory subject due to better problem-solving skills and a more developed understanding of theoretical content. We suggest that consideration be given in all science curricula to the separation of theory and practicum by developing two subjects with clearly defined different learning outcomes.

AB Begg DP, Woods SC. Interactions between the central nervous system and pancreatic islet secretions: a historical perspective. Adv Physiol Educ 37: 53-60, 2013; doi:10.1152/advan.00167.2012.-The endocrine pancreas is richly innervated with sympathetic and parasympathetic projections from the brain. In the mid-20th century, it was established that alpha-adrenergic activation inhibits, whereas cholinergic stimulation promotes, insulin secretion; this demonstrated the importance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in pancreatic endocrine function. It was later established that insulin injected peripherally could act within the brain, leading to the discovery of insulin and insulin receptors within the brain and the receptor-mediated transport of insulin into the central nervous system from endothelial cells. The insulin receptor within the central nervous system is widely distributed, reflecting insulin's diverse range of actions, including acting as an adiposity signal to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure, regulation of systemic glucose responses, altering sympathetic activity, and involvement in cognitive function. As observed with central insulin administration, the pancreatic hormones glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and amylin can each also reduce food intake. Pancreatic and also gut hormones are released cephalically, in what is an important mechanism to prepare the body for a meal and prevent excessive postprandial hyperglycemia.

AB Patwardhan K. The history of the discovery of blood circulation: unrecognized contributions of Ayurveda masters. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 77-82, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00123.2011.-Ayurveda, the native healthcare system of India, is a rich resource of well-documented ancient medical knowledge. Although the roots of this knowledge date back to the Vedic and post-Vedic eras, it is generally believed that a dedicated branch for healthcare was gradually established approximately between 400 BCE and 200 CE. Probably because the language of documentation of these early textbooks is in Sanskrit, a language that is not in day-to-day use among the general population even in India, many significant contributions of Ayurveda have remained unrecognized in the literature related to the history of medicine. In this communication, the discovery of blood circulation has been taken up as a case, and a few important references from the representative Ayurveda compendia that hint at a preliminary understanding of the cardiovascular system as a "closed circuit" and the heart acting as a pump have been reviewed. The central argument of this review is that these contributions from Ayurveda too must be recorded and credited when reviewing the milestones in the history of medicine, as Ayurveda can still possibly guide various streams of the current sciences, if revisited with this spirit.

AB Klegeris A, Hurren H. Impact of problem-based learning in a large classroom setting: student perception and problem-solving skills. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 408-415, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00046.2011.Problem- based learning (PBL) can be described as a learning environment where the problem drives the learning. This technique usually involves learning in small groups, which are supervised by tutors. It is becoming evident that PBL in a small-group setting has a robust positive effect on student learning and skills, including better problem-solving skills and an increase in overall motivation. However, very little research has been done on the educational benefits of PBL in a large classroom setting. Here, we describe a PBL approach (using tutorless groups) that was introduced as a supplement to standard didactic lectures in University of British Columbia Okanagan undergraduate biochemistry classes consisting of 45-85 students. PBL was chosen as an effective method to assist students in learning biochemical and physiological processes. By monitoring student attendance and using informal and formal surveys, we demonstrated that PBL has a significant positive impact on student motivation to attend and participate in the course work. Student responses indicated that PBL is superior to traditional lecture format with regard to the understanding of course content and retention of information. We also demonstrated that student problem-solving skills are significantly improved, but additional controlled studies are needed to determine how much PBL exercises contribute to this improvement. These preliminary data indicated several positive outcomes of using PBL in a large classroom setting, although further studies aimed at assessing student learning are needed to further justify implementation of this technique in courses delivered to large undergraduate classes.

AB Seluakumaran K, Jusof FF, Ismail R, Husain R. Integrating an open-source course management system (Moodle) into the teaching of a first-year medical physiology course: a case study. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 369-377, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00008.2011.-Educators in medical schools around the world are presently experimenting with innovative ways of using web-based learning to supplement the existing teaching and learning process. We have recently used a popular open-source course management system (CMS) called the modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (Moodle) to construct an online site (DPhysiol) to facilitate our face-to-face teaching of physiology to a group of first-year students in the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program. The integration of the Moodle site into our teaching was assessed using online log activity, student examination marks, and feedback from students. The freely available Moodle platform was simple to use, helped to effectively deliver course materials, and has features that allowed cooperative learning. Students used the CMS throughout their academic year and commented favorably regarding its use as a complement to the face-to-face classroom sessions. The group of students who used the CMS obtained significantly higher scores in the final examination compared with the previous class that did not use the CMS. In addition, there was a significant correlation between student participation and performance in online quizzes and their final examination marks. However, students' overall online usage of the CMS did not correlate with their examination marks. We recommend Moodle as a useful tool for physiology educators who are interested in integrating web-based learning into their existing teaching curriculum.

AB Braga VA. Teaching the renal tubular reabsorption of glucose using two classic papers by Shannon et al. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 114-116, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00108.2010.-Most of the transport along the nephron uses membrane proteins and exhibits the three characteristics of mediated transport: saturation, specificity, and competition. Glucose reabsorption in the nephron is an excellent example of the consequences of saturation. Two classic papers by James A. Shannon and colleagues clearly show the ability of the kidney in transporting glucose and its saturation process, providing students with examples of the handling of glucose by the kidney. In addition, these articles demonstrate how stable and reproducible is the transport maximum of glucose in the proximal tubule under different experimental conditions. One key figure from each classic paper can be used to give students insight into how glucose transport becomes saturated, resulting in the excretion of glucose in urine, and will also give students a clear example of how careful experimentation and a clear interest in renal physiology led Shannon and colleagues to advance the field.

AB Prakash ES, Narayan KA, Sethuraman KR. Student perceptions regarding the usefulness of explicit discussion of the "structure of the observed learning outcome" taxonomy. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 145149, 2010; doi:10.1152/advan.00026.2010.-One method of grading responses of the descriptive type is by using Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy. The basis of this study was the expectation that if students were oriented to SOLO taxonomy, it would provide them an opportunity to understand some of the factors that teachers consider while grading descriptive responses and possibly develop strategies to improve scores. We first sampled the perceptions of 68 second-year undergraduate medical students doing the Respiratory System course regarding the usefulness of explicit discussion of SOLO taxonomy. Subsequently, in a distinct cohort of 20 second-year medical students doing the Central Nervous System course, we sought to determine whether explicit illustration of SOLO taxonomy combined with some advice on better answering descriptive test questions (to an experimental group) resulted in better student scores in a continuous assessment test compared with providing advice for better answering test questions but without any reference to SOLO taxonomy (the control group). Student ratings of the clarity of the presentation on SOLO taxonomy appeared satisfactory to the authors, as was student understanding of our presentation. The majority of participants indicated that knowledge of SOLO taxonomy would help them study and prepare better answers for questions of the descriptive type. Although scores in the experimental and control group were comparable, this experience nonetheless provided us with the motivation to orient students to SOLO taxonomy early on in the medical program and further research factors that affect students' development of strategies based on knowledge of SOLO taxonomy.

AB Formal training in how to mentor is not generally available to students, postdoctoral fellows, or junior faculty. We provide here a framework to develop as a mentor, using the GREAT model. This includes giving opportunities and opening doors; reaching out to help students identify their strengths and reach their goals; encouraging them by serving as a positive example; advising each mentee as an individual; and training them for independent thinking. In this personal view, we expand on each of these steps to illustrate how to develop a personalized mentoring style of your own. By combining these approaches, you as a mentor can work with your mentees to develop an effective and productive mentoring relationship.

TI Use of Ripple Effects Mapping to assess student-perceived benefits of

ID INVOLVEMENT; NETWORKING
AB Ripple Effects Mapping (REM) is a qualitative data analysis approach that combines mind mapping with inductive analysis to con-dense data obtained from group interviews. One benefit of REM is the ability to identify unintended outcomes, or "ripples," of the intervention of interest. Ripples are visually represented by a mind map created during the REM session. Mind maps connect related concepts, typically with the main concept in the center of the map and supporting ideas radiating from a central node. This project applied REM to undergraduate course evaluation. The purpose of this study was threefold: to use REM to identify undergraduate student-perceived benefits of research projects, to assess whether REM could be used to confirm achievement of course learning objectives, and to compare the themes identified from the mind mapping component of REM to those identi-fied by inductive analysis. Mind maps were generated with Xmind (Xmind Ltd., Hong Kong) during online sessions by two groups of students, those who completed a "mandatory" research project (n = 11) and those who chose to participate in an additional "optional" research project (n = 9). There was considerable overlap in identified themes between mind mapping and inductive analysis, with skills, relationships, career direction, and unexpected benefits identified by both techniques. Mind mapping identi-fied several additional themes. Findings from both approaches were compared to course learning objectives, and both con-firmed that all objectives were met. In situations where time is a limiting factor, mind mapping could be superior to the complete REM approach for course learning objective assessments.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study used Ripple Effects Mapping (REM) to identify undergraduate student-perceived benefits of research projects, to assess whether REM could confirm achievement of course learning objectives for a research project-based course, and to compare themes identified from the mind mapping component of REM to those identified by inductive analysis. Mind mapping confirmed achievement of course objectives and may be a better choice compared to inductive reasoning when time is limited.

AB Among the various systems taught in the preclinical phases, the nervous system is more challenging to learn than other systems. In this report, a novel teaching methodology, "real-life scenario (RLS) blended teaching," is described and its effectiveness in facilitating inquisitive learning in undergraduate medical students is evaluated. This mixed-method study was conducted among three groups (group 1, n=83; group 2, n=85; and group 3; n=79) of undergraduate medical students (18-20 yr) in the neurol- ogy and behavioral sciences module. RLS was presented to students in the form of demonstrations, role-plays, videos, and group activities. Group 1 students underwent traditional teaching-learning sessions. Group 2 students underwent RLS blended sessions and were provided with multiple miniassignments in a vignette format. Group 3 students received RLS blended ses- sions, multiple miniassignments, peer discussions, multiple formative assessments, and facilitator feedback sessions. The student performances on different exams were compared in terms of their group, and their perceptions of RLS were documented. Students exposed to RLS sessions blended with multiple assignments, peer discussions, multiple formative assignments, and facilitator feedback sessions performed well in the final summative assessments (67.87%) compared with those exposed to RLS sessions and assignments (50.21%) or exposed to traditional teaching alone (50.34%). RLS sessions increased students' curiosity and motivated them to learn the subject well. RLS sessions stimulated student interest and facilitated their learning. RLS along with effective use of multiple assignments, formative assessments, and/or feedback sessions significantly improved student learning. This demonstrates the effectiveness of this active method in teaching various subjects with appropriate modifications. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this report, a novel teaching methodology, "real-life scenario (RLS) blended teaching" is described and its effectiveness in facilitating inquisitive learning in undergraduate medical students is evaluated. Students exposed to RLS sessions blended with multiple miniassignments, peer discussions, multiple formative assignments, and facilitator feedback ses- sions performed well in the summative assessments compared with those exposed to RLS sessions and assignments or exposed to traditional teaching alone. Students preferred active teaching-learning techniques over the traditional method.

AB The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) aims to increase diver-sity in research and health-related careers. The SURP provides underrepresented minority (URM) and disadvantaged students with research, mentoring, and networking experiences; real-life surgical observations; and simulated cardiovascular demonstrations. A postprogram survey was developed to assess program outcomes and explore ways of improving the program to stimulate URM and disadvantaged students' interest in research and health-related careers. This is a report of those postprogram survey findings. Using a survey research design, an online survey was emailed to participants (n = 88). Data were collected for 6 weeks beginning March 2020. There were 37 multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding education, career choices, and program experiences. Responses were downloaded to statistical software for analyses. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Major themes were identified for qualitative data. Responses were received from 44.3% (n = 39) of former SURP participants. Overall, 59% stated that the SURP influenced their career goals. When asked about mentor-mentee relationships, 69.3% responded that their interactions were excellent or good; 61.5% maintained contact with their mentor after the SURP. Finally, 79% indicated their SURP ex-perience was excellent or good, and 84.6% would recommend the SURP to others. The SURP has been successful at providing URM and disadvantaged students with positive research experiences and long-term mentor-mentee relationships and has influenced educational and/or career goals. Programs that expose URM and disadvantaged students to basic, clinical, and/or translational research are beneficial for stimulating interest in research and health-related careers.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mentor-mentee relationships were extremely beneficial as many of the former participants maintained contact with their summer mentor after the program ended. This assessment also revealed that exposing underrepresented and minority students to research has a long-lasting effect on career and educational goals.

AB Undergraduate science students face immense pressure, both internally and externally, to achieve certain grades. Grade-focused interactions between students and instructors have anecdotally been reported to be increasing. However, no empirical study has yet evaluated students' grade perceptions or the prevalence of these interactions. If we want to change students' grade fixation, we first need to understand it. The purpose of this research study was to investigate the prevalence of and factors that contribute to students' grade-focused interactions. Using a mixed-methods approach via surveys and a quasi-experimental intervention with focus groups and audio recordings of student-instructor interactions, we found that students' perceptions of grades are relatively fixed. Furthermore, although >25% of our respondents reported negotiating a grade, there were no significant perceptual differences or academic values held between students who self-reported engaging in grade-focused interactions and those who did not. Our findings suggest that unless institutional and professional program requirements change, the pressure faced by students and their preoccupation with grades will not change either.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Undergraduate science students face immense pressure to perform academically; this pressure may be linked to grade-focused interactions, which have been anecdotally reported among educators. This study evaluated the prevalence of and motivations underlying this behavior. One-quarter of our study participants self-reported negotiating a grade. The vast majority of respondents perceived that they lost grades (rather than earned them); an intervention to change this "grade loss" mentality failed to have any impact on students' behavior.

AB This study examines how lower secondary school students understand the circulatory system, using the structure-behavior-function (SBF) framework for conceptual representation. It evaluates the progress of students' understanding after interventions with two different teaching approaches, one using a biology textbook supported by augmented reality (AR) technology and the other using only a textbook as a main source of information. The data analysis is based on the assumption that systemic understanding demands the perception of three system dimensions: the components forming the system at all levels of organization (its structures), the interactions and mechanisms between them (its behavior), and the function as a whole outcome (its phenomena). The results indicate that both learning approaches contribute to a higher level of understanding the circulatory system. The group using AR-supported educational materials showed statistically significant better improvements in their knowledge of the circulatory system, including all three components of the SBF framework.

AB Health science represents the fastest-growing industry in the United States, a trend not predicted to slow for the next decade. The high demand for health professionals has led to increased demand for anatomy and physiology (A&P) courses and a transition to hybrid-style labs to meet the necessary increased enrollment without increasing the need for lab space and compromising educational quality. The transition to hybrid-style labs has only accelerated and become more important with the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been relatively unclear, however, how the hybrid style has impacted student learning, satisfaction, and performance. Furthermore, there is a general lack of research investigating the advantages and disadvantages across hybrid, online, and face-to-face styles. This lack of research is particularly obvious within biological sciences, including A&P. Attendance, practical grades, and overall grades were compared between face-to-face, hybrid, and online A&P lab styles. A survey was administered to compare student perceptions and experiences between hybrid and online lab styles. The hybrid style had many of the same advantages as online and face-to-face styles yet very few disadvantages. Hybrid lab students reported better experiences and greater satisfaction, attended more labs, and outperformed online lab students. Face-to-face lab students, however, outperformed hybrid lab students. These findings can ultimately inform how to best implement, organize, and improve hybrid-style labs to maximize student learning, achievement, and enjoyment.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Demand for health professionals increased the demand for A&P courses and led to a transition to hybrid-style labs. There is a general lack of research investigating advantages/disadvantages across hybrid, online, and face-toface styles. I found that the hybrid style had many of the advantages of online and face-to-face styles yet very few disadvantages. Hybrid lab students reported better experiences and greater satisfaction and outperformed online lab students. Face-to-face lab students, however, outperformed hybrid lab students.

AB Restrictions due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacted the ability of faculty and students in exercise science to work in lab settings with human participants. The purpose of this study was to determine how exercise science faculty were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions with respect to access and use of exercise science lab and research facilities. Of the 100 surveyed participants categorized as requiring access to people and lab spaces (lab-based faculty), 61% (n = 61) reported decreased research productivity with 87% (n = 53) of those faculty in one or more of the following subdisciplines: exercise physiology, clinical exercise physiology, or biomechanics. Of all lab-based faculty, 40% (n = 40) participants reported having access to students and lab spaces and 55% (n = 55) indicated they were allowed to conduct in-person research. Of tenuretrack lab-based faculty, 80% (n = 20) reported a decrease in research productivity, of which 60.0% (n = 12) identified as female. Among faculty with 5 or less years of teaching experience (n = 23), 69.6% (n = 16) reported a decrease in productivity, with 68.8% (n = 11) of those being female. All exercise science faculty surveyed reported issues with safety and social distancing, modified lab and research procedures, faculty workload, and research productivity. This information can be leveraged to create better infrastructure to support faculty and develop and implement strategies to reduce workload inequities.

ID PERCEPTIONS
AB Professional skill development has emerged as an increasingly important facet of undergraduate training, specifically within science curricula. The primarily agreed on professional skills for a well-rounded scientist include teamwork, oral communication, written communication, and quantitative skills. The demand for these skills has been driven by employers and graduate/professional schools. To this end, instructors in higher education have begun to integrate professional skill development into their course design and student learning goals. However, the attitudes of students themselves toward the importance of different professional skills, the inclusion of these skills in their coursework, level of improvement, and end confidence has yet to be thoroughly characterized. It was the aim of this study to ascertain students' desire for the aforementioned professional skills within their undergraduate science programs by exploring student perceptions of professional skills inclusion, importance, improvement, and confidence and identify the local courses students recognize as utilizing "teamwork activities." Here we detail these attitudes in biomedical science undergraduates at Michigan State University. By using the Science Student Skills Inventory (SSSI), a previously validated assessment tool, we observed differences in student perceptions of professional skills when compared to previous SSSI studies. We also observed significant differences in attitudes between age groups in respect to writing and communication skills, differing perceptions of what constitutes teamwork, as well as gender differences in respect to attitudes around communication and ethical thinking skills. Our results give valuable insight into student perspectives on how professional skills are developed in their program. These data may be used to inform curriculum development within and across institutions.

AB As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience specifically on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simplified complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.

AB Recommendations for enhancing scientific literacy, inclusivity, and the ecosystem for innovation call for transitioning from teacher-centered to learner-centered science classrooms, particularly at the introductory undergraduate level. Yet little is documented about the challenges that undergraduates perceive in such classrooms and the students' ways of navigating them. Via mixed methods, we studied undergraduates' lived experience in one form of learner-centered teaching, hybrid project-/problembased learning (PBL), in introductory organismal biology at a baccalaureate institution. Prominent in qualitative analyses of student interviews and written reflections were undergraduates' initial expectation of and longing for an emphasis on facts and transmission of them. The prominence diminished from semester's middle to end, as students came to value developing ideas, solving problems collaboratively, and engaging in deep ways of learning. Collaboration and personal resources such as belief in self emerged as supports for these shifts. Quantitative analyses corroborated that PBL students transformed as learners, moving toward informed views on the nature of science, advancing in multivariable causal reasoning, and more frequently adopting deep approaches for learning than students in lecture-based sections. The qualitative and quantitative findings portray the PBL classroom as an intercultural experience in which culture shock yields over time to acceptance in a way supported by students' internal resources and peer collaboration. The findings have value to those seeking to implement PBL and other complex-learning approaches in a manner responsive to the lived experience of the learner.

AB Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree program curricula are typically comprised of heavy course loads and assessment burden. Typically, students "live" from exam to exam only preparing and studying for the exam directly ahead of them while neglecting concurrent courses. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the impact of weekly multicourse collective exams academic behaviors and learning in an integrated biological sciences (BSI) course within a PharmD program. Weekly multicourse exams included questions, four per credit hour, from all first semester courses that traditionally included summative exams. Seven courses contributed questions, which amounted to 15 weekly exams of similar to 60 questions. No other graded assessments were given in any of the courses, other than individual course cumulative final exams; the final exams in each course were not collective. After completion of final exams, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all students and the two professors teaching the course. Course grades, not including the final exam, were compared between two cohorts with or without the collective exams to determine impact on learning. The cumulative final exam was compared between cohorts to determine impact on retention. The majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that the weekly collective exams encouraged them to study BSI more frequently, most days of the week, reduced the likelihood of skipping class, and increased likelihood to pay attention and engage in class. The majority believed that they better learned and retained the BSI material. The majority specified that they liked the collective exams for BSI and preferred it over a traditional exam schedule. Learning also appeared to be improved. However, the impact on retention is less clear and requires further research. In conclusion, the weekly multicourse collective exams improved academic behaviors and learning.

AB Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rice University canceled classes for the week of March 9-13, 2020 and shifted all instruction to online only following spring break. For the second half of the semester, animal physiology was taught exclusively over Zoom. Here we describe how a flipped teaching format that was used before the pandemic eased the transition from face-to-face teaching to online instruction. The preclass preparation resources and the active learning materials that were already in place for flipped teaching were helpful in the transition to solely online teaching. Therefore, the focus during the transition was to reconfigure active learning and examinations from the face-to-face format to the online platform. Instead of small group discussions in the classroom, teams interacted in Zoom Breakout Rooms. Rather than taking exams in-person during scheduled class time, students submitted exams online. Additionally, students prerecorded their project presentations instead of presenting them "live" during the last week of classes. Overall, students felt that the class smoothly transitioned to a remote only format. These and other changes to the instructional methods will be implemented during the Spring 2021 semester when the course is taught fully online.

AB Laboratory classes are a cornerstone of physiology education, enabling students to develop essential knowledge and skills. Recent moves toward utilizing blended options to support face-to-face classes with online materials are beneficial, but using solely online classes may not produce similar learning gains. During 2020, the global pandemic meant a loss of face-to-face teaching, such that laboratory classes were rapidly transitioned to online delivery. This study explores the impact of this shift on undergraduate students, evaluating their use of the online laboratory classes and the impact this had on their examination performance and their perceptions of learning. Student use of the online laboratory classes varied, with those spending more time performing better on examinations. Students valued the online classes, finding them helpful for their learning, but also felt that the lack of face-to-face laboratory classes and interactions with peers and teaching staff was detrimental to their learning experience. Overall, academic performance of online learners was comparable to previous years but may indicate some underlying deficits.

AB Electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most widely used methods in clinical diagnosis. Here we describe an experimental approach that offers hands-on learning of its basic principles. An experimental model that consists of a rubber foil with a low electrical conductivity and a DC power unit is used to simulate the body and the electric dipole of the heart. It enables students to learn about the main features of the electric dipole and to visualize the induced electric potential in the body. The determination of the characteristic equipotential lines around the dipole and the measurement of simple electrocardiograms, comprising bipolar and unipolar leads, are made with a low-cost voltmeter. To make the exercise more relevant to clinical ECG, as well as making it more interesting, the students are additionally tasked to measure their own electrocardiogram with a simple, personal handheld ECG device.

AB Blended learning, is a teaching approach that integrates online self-learning and classroom teaching. When designed well, blended learning courses in medicine can facilitate students to improve themselves in self-learning, understanding. and problem solving, ultimately enhancing their learning efficiency. However, blended teaching methods are usually used in only a single course, so it is unclear whether these methods can work well in a variety of basic medical courses. The goal of this study is to explore students' perceptions of whether blended laboratory courses are helpful for them in overcoming the difficulties they experience. Blended laboratory courses were taken by medical students at Guilin Medical University. Approximately 71.1% of the students agreed that online lecture courses improved their understanding of threshold concepts and the underlying theories. The majority of the students (63.01%) held the opinion that the blended laboratory courses were more effective than other types of courses in achieving the knowledge goals. The majority of the teachers believed that students' interest in experimentation operations, hands-on abilities, confidence, and other factors were greatly improved compared with those of students taught using the traditional teaching model (face to face). In addition, the average scores for the quizzes of laboratory courses were significantly improved in the blended learning method compared with the traditional learning method. Blended laboratory courses arc successful and welcomed by both students and teachers in undergraduate laboratory courses.

AB Physiology is one of the major foundational sciences for the medical curriculum. This discipline has proven challenging for students to master due to ineffective content acquisition and retention. Preliminary data obtained from a survey completed by "low-performance" students (those maintaining a grade average below the passing mark of 70%) at Morehouse School of Medicine reported that students lacked the ability to adequately recognize and extract important physiological concepts to successfully navigate multiple-choice assessments. It was hypothesized that a specially designed, small-group, active learning. physiology in-course enrichment program would minimize course assessment failure rates by enhancing the ability of low-performance students to effectively identify important course content, successfully perform on multiple-choice assessments, and, thereby, improve overall course performance. Using self-report surveys, study skills and test-taking deficiencies limiting successful comprehension of course material and examination performance were identified. Mini-quiz assessments and assignments in formulating multiple-choice examination questions were given to help students recognize and solidify core concepts and improve test-taking ability. Lastly, self-report surveys evaluated the effectiveness of the enrichment program on overall course performance. Results showed a marked improvement in student confidence levels with regards to approaching multiple-choice assessments, and a significant improvement in grades achieved in the physiology component of the first-year curriculum, as 100% of participants achieved a final passing grade average of >= 70%. It was concluded that students became more proficient in identifying, understanding, and applying core physiological concepts and more successful in mastering multiple-choice questions.

ID WORK
AB A large, multicampus, public medical school underwent curricular renewal, emphasizing a student-centered approach with 50% of all course contact time devoted to active learning. Determining the impact of active learning on student engagement and higher order skill (HOS) proficiency was the primary aim of this study. Following Institutional Review Board approval. two cohort groups of first-year medical students were enrolled. The first cohort (n = 54) included students before curriculum reform in the legacy curriculum (LC). The second cohort (n = 73) included students completing studies in the renewed curriculum (RC). Near the end of the first year of medical school, both cohorts completed a validated survey of student engagement, and a proctored problem-based assessment of HOS proficiency [Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+)]. Results indicated RC students perceived greater levels of engagement than LC (39.5 +5.8 vs. 33.3+5.6), and greater reliance on HOS. including analysis, synthesis, and application. However, there were no significant differences between cohorts in proficiency of HOS when assessed by the CLA+ (LC = 1,878 +/- 161 vs. RC = 1,900 +/- 157). Additionally. poor correlation between engagement and HOS for both LC and RC indicated more engaged students do not necessarily possess greater HOS proficiency. Ceiling effect may explain results as medical students enter medical school as highly skilled learners with potentially little room for improvement. It will be informative to continue to track engagement and HOS of both cohort groups as they continue their medical studies.

AB Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This twelfth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the assumption of normality, an assumption essential to the meaningful interpretation of a t test. Although the data themselves can be consistent with a normal distribution, they need not be. Instead, it is the theoretical distribution of the sample mean or the theoretical distribution of the difference between sample means that must be roughly normal. The most versatile approach to assess normality is to bootstrap the sample mean, the difference between sample means, or t itself. We can then assess whether the distributions of these bootstrap statistics are consistent with a normal distribution by studying their normal quantile plots. If we suspect that an inference we make from a t test may not be justified-if we suspect that the theoretical distribution of the sample mean or the theoretical distribution of the difference between sample means is not normal-then we can use a permutation method to analyze our data.

AB Physiology Understanding (PhUn) Week is an annual science outreach program sponsored by the American Physiological Society in which K-12 students learn about physiology through meeting a physiologist and performing an experiment. Performing PhUn Week at an Australian private primary school during a family vacation in 2014 enabled me to receive a fellowship to return the following year for further implementation. To set up the outreach, I contacted the assistant principal of a public primary school, and she connected me with the physical education (PE) teacher. Together, the PE teacher and I planned the event. Over the course of 2 days, I taught eight classes, a total of 176 K-12 students. I started each lesson by explaining the role of a physiologist. The scientific method was described and explained. A hypothesis, "Exercise increases heart rate," was designed and tested. The students measured their heart rates, exercised, and measured their heart rates again. After data collection, results were reported, and the students all agreed that their hypothesis was supported. We then discussed heart function and why heart rate increases with exercise. The students then performed a pedometer challenge, where they estimated the number of steps during walking, running, and kangaroo hopping. They enjoyed testing their predictions and repeated these experiments several times. The students then made suggestions of ways they could continue this lesson outside of school. This first report of an international PhUn week confirmed that these events form partnerships among educators and inspire K-12 students to think about becoming scientists.

AB As a newcomer, the philosophical basis of systems biology seems intuitive and appealing, the underlying philosophy being that the whole of a living system cannot be completely understood by the study of its individual parts. Yet answers to the questions "What is systems biology?" and "What constitutes a systems biology approach in 2016?" are somewhat more elusive. This seems to be due largely to the diversity of disciplines involved and the varying emphasis placed on the computational modeling and experimental aspects of systems biology. As such, the education of systems biology would benefit from multidisciplinary collaboration with both instructors and students from a range of disciplines within the same course. This essay is the personal reflection of a graduate student trying to get an introductory overview of the field of systems biology and some thoughts about effective education of systems biology.

AB The flipped classroom is a relatively new approach to undergraduate teaching in science. This approach repurposes class time to focus on application and discussion; the acquisition of basic concepts and principles is done on the students' own time before class. While current flipped classroom research has focused on student preferences and comparative learning outcomes, there remains a lack of understanding regarding its impact on students' approaches to learning. Focusing on a new flipped classroom-based course for basic medical sciences students, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate students' adjustments to the flipped classroom, their time on task compared with traditional lectures, and their deep and active learning strategies. Students in this course worked through interactive online learning modules before in-class sessions. Class time focused on knowledge application of online learning module content through active learning methods. Students completed surveys and optional prequiz questions throughout the term to provide data regarding their learning approaches. Our results showed that the majority of students completed their prework in one sitting just before class. Students reported performing less multitasking behavior in the flipped classroom compared with lecture-based courses. Students valued opportunities for peer-peer and peer-instructor interactions and also valued having multiple modes of assessment. Overall, this work suggests that there is the potential for greater educational gains from the flipped classroom than the modest improvements in grades previously demonstrated in the literature; in this implementation of the flipped classroom, students reported that they developed independent learning strategies, spent more time on task, and engaged in deep and active learning.

AB Explaining the concept of lung compliance remains a challenge to the physiology teacher because it cannot be demonstrated easily in human subjects and all attempts until now have used only simulation models. A simple device is described in the present article to measure the compliance of the "lung-thorax" combine in human subjects with the caveat that what is recorded is not "lung" compliance and the data generated are of little clinical use. The device comprises a spirometer, a manometer, a mouthpiece, and interconnecting tubes guarded with stopcocks.

ID TEACHERS; STYLES
AB Student-centered learning is generally defined as any instructional method that purportedly engages students in active learning and critical thinking. The student-centered method of teaching moves the focus from teaching to learning, from the teachers' conveying course concepts via lecture to the understanding of concepts by students. The student-centered method has been used extensively in lecture courses in China; however, there is little evidence of its use in laboratory courses. The purpose of the present study was to describe the implementation of a student-centered method in a pathophysiology laboratory course. The use of student-centered learning strategies in an undergraduate laboratory course was well received by both students and teachers. Here, students had to take on responsibility for their own learning and, thus, became more accountable. Moreover, they reported increased active learning, skill development, information collection, and retention. In addition, mean scores for the quiz were significantly higher in the student-centered method compared with the traditional teaching method. The shift from teacher-centered delivery to a student-centered model led to a positive change, in which the learners drove the process and were guided, not directed, by the teacher.

SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article

   design; large laboratory course
ID EDUCATION
AB Laboratory courses serve as important gateways to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. One of the challenges in assessing laboratory learning is to conduct meaningful and standardized practical exams, especially for large multisection laboratory courses. Laboratory practical exams in life sciences courses are frequently administered by asking students to move from station to station to answer questions, apply knowledge gained during laboratory experiments, interpret data, and identify various tissues and organs using various microscopic and gross specimens. This approach puts a stringent time limit on all questions regardless of the level of difficulty and also invariably increases the potential risk of cheating. To avoid potential cheating in laboratory courses with multiple sections, the setup for practical exams is often changed in some way between sections. In laboratory courses with multiple instructors or teaching assistants, practical exams may be handled inconsistently among different laboratory sections, due to differences in background knowledge, perceptions of the laboratory goals, or prior teaching experience. In this article, we describe a design for a laboratory practical exam that aims to align the assessment questions with well-defined laboratory learning objectives and improve the consistency among all laboratory sections.

AB A specific faculty development program for tutors to teach cross-cultural care in a preclinical gastrointestinal pathophysiology course with weekly longitudinal followup sessions was designed in 2007 and conducted in the same manner over a 6-yr period. Anonymous student evaluations of how "frequently" the course and the tutor were actively teaching cross-cultural care were performed. The statements "This tutor actively teaches culturally competent care" and "Issues of culture and ethnicity were addressed" were significantly improved over baseline 2004 data. These increases were sustained over the 6-yr period. A tutor's overall rating as a teacher was moderately correlated with his/her "frequently" actively teaching cross-cultural care (r = 0.385, P < 0. 001). Course evaluation scores were excellent and put the course into the group of preclinical courses with the top ratings. Students in the Race in Curriculum Group asked that the program be expanded to other preclinical courses. In conclusion, from 2007 to 2012, a faculty development program for teaching cross-cultural care consistently increased the discussion of cross-cultural care in the tutorial and course over each year beginning with 2007 compared with the baseline year of 2004. Our data suggest that cross-cultural care can be effectively integrated into pathophysiology tutorials and helps improve students' satisfaction and tutors' ratings. Teaching crosscultural care in a pathophysiology tutorial did not detract from the course's overall evaluations, which remained in the top group over the 6-yr period.

AB In engaging lectures, also referred to as broken or interactive lectures, students are given short periods of lecture followed by "breaks" that can consist of 1-min papers, problem sets, brainstorming sessions, or open discussion. While many studies have shown positive effects when engaging lectures are used in undergraduate settings, the literature surrounding use of the learning technique for professional students is inconclusive. The novelty of this study design allowed a direct comparison of engaging physiology lectures versus didactic lecture formats in the same cohort of 120 first-year School of Dentistry DMD students. All students were taught five physiological systems using traditional lecture methods and six physiological systems using engaging lecture methods. The use of engaging lectures led to a statistically significant higher average on unit exams compared with traditional didactic lectures (8.6% higher, P < 0.05). Furthermore, students demonstrated an improved long-term retention of information via higher scores on the comprehensive final exam (22.9% higher in engaging lecture sections, P < 0.05). Many qualitative improvements were also indicated via student surveys and evaluations, including an increased perceived effectiveness of lectures, decrease in distractions during lecture, and increased confidence with the material. The development of engaging lecture activities requires a significant amount of instructor preparation and limits the time available to provide traditional lectures. However, the positive results of this study suggest the need for a restructuring of the physiology curriculum to incorporate more engaging lectures to improve both the qualitative experiences and performance levels of professional students.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 168-177, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00118.2010.-In 2004 and 2007, the American Physiological Society (APS) Trainee Advisory Committee (TAC) conducted surveys of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and new investigators in physiology to identify topics and issues important to those trainees. Two major trends emerged from the data. First, trainees in 2007 expressed somewhat greater interest in professional development information than did those in 2004. Second, needs expressed by trainees in both years were closely related to their specific career development stage. Survey findings guided the TAC and other APS committees and groups to focus their efforts toward the issues that were of the greatest interest to trainees. It also led to improved communication with trainees and increased involvement of trainees in APS governance.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 110-113, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00071.2010.-Using an excised pig heart preparation with tubes, a manometer, and a visualizing apparatus, Giulio Ceradini, an Italian physiologist working in the years of 1871-1872 in Carl Ludwig's famous laboratory in Leipzig, Germany, illustrated the mechanism of closure of the semilunar valves. He was the first to conceive that the closure of the heart valves depends not on a static back pressure nor upon eddies but is primarily the consequence of the decelerated systolic efflux. This pioneer research of Ceradini was first published in German in 1872 (4). The purpose of the present report is to revisit Ceradini's pioneering experiments and his interpretation of heart valve closure, which remains as true as it was in 1872.

Adv Physiol Educ 34: 90-92,2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00015.2010.-We constructed a robust and low-priced finger pulse sensor from a singing greeting card beeper. The beeper outputs the plethysmographic signal, which is indistinguishable from that of commercial grade sensors. The sensor can be used in school for a number of experiments in human cardiovascular physiology.

ID EDUCATION; FRAMEWORK
AB Professionalism and communication were formally introduced in India's Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) as part of the five roles of an Indian medical graduate and 10 core competencies in the Bachelor of Science Nursing program. It may be challenging to teach the complexity of clinical medical ethics to undergraduate students at a young age in the absence of direct patient interaction. Trigger films (TFs) are brief (3-10 min) clips that have been used in the West to provoke debate, promote reflection, and assist trainees in dealing with ethical dilemmas. The aim of this study was to determine whether TFs can be used to teach professionalism and ethics to undergraduate medical and nursing students as an innovative and interesting tool and to see whether this results in any changes in knowledge. A 2-h module supported by an introductory PowerPoint presentation and using four TFs on the four pillars of ethics (beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice) was developed and piloted in the foundation course for the new cohort of medical and nursing students. Quantitative, open-ended feedback was taken from learners after module delivery, and knowledge was assessed with a retrospective pre-post questionnaire. The majority of students found TFs an innovative and interesting tool to teach medical ethics. There was a gain in knowledge of autonomy (52%), beneficence (48%), nonmaleficence (46%), and justice (38%). TFs can be effective tools to impart core competencies in ethics and professionalism to both nursing and medical students in the new CBC.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Teaching ethics is an important part of the medical curriculum, and since first-year students are not in direct contact with patients it is necessary to think of innovative methods that can be used to teach. We have done the pilot testing for the same, using trigger films among undergraduate medical and nursing students.

AB Since the availability of lecture recordings, there have been limited studies of any associations between face-to-face lecture attendance and academic outcomes. The aims of the study, in an introductory pathophysiology course, where lecture recordings were available, were 1) to quantify lecture attendance and any associations between academic outcomes and lecture attendance, and 2) to determine why students do or do not attend lectures. Data were analyzed for the whole cohort before separating the nursing (similar to 60%) and nonnursing students. Of 288 enrolled students, 205 consented to sign the attendance register, and 139 to undertake the online survey. Lecture attendance was higher (41%) before the midsemester exam than afterwards (24%), P < 0.001, due to higher attendance by the nursing than nonnursing students. Students who attended similar to 50% of lectures consistently got higher academic outcomes than those that attended <50%, e.g., examinations, 11 percent points higher. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficients for students from both the sign-in and survey showed that there were positive associations between lecture attendance and academic outcomes, which were mainly weak for nursing students (P <= 0.05), with no association for nonnursing students. From the survey, most students who attended lectures did so because they considered they learned more by attending lectures, whereas not liking the lecture time was the most common reason for not attending lectures. In conclusion, even though students have access to lecture recordings, lecture attendance is still a determinant of academic outcomes for some students of pathophysiology.

AB Although considerable staff resources are often allocated to the teaching of undergraduate laboratory classes, there is a paucity of discussion regarding the extent and substance of the staff-student interactions that occur within classes and also whether these interactions benefit student learning in any way. Performed across four undergraduate laboratory sessions, this exploratory study aimed to quantify the interactions in terms of frequency, duration, and initiation of interactions, as well as gathering staff and student perceptions of the impact of the interactions. Staff gathered descriptive data by completing an observation checklist after each interaction and also provided their own perceptions of the interaction focus and outcome. Student perceptions were collected using an online survey after each class. Staff perceived that the most frequent achievement of the interactions was to enable students to progress with work. However, students' perceptions suggested that staff may underestimate the impact of staff-student interactions on conceptual learning. The most striking findings were the students' perceptions of the impact of interactions on their affective domain. On average, 93% of students agreed that when staff take an interest in their work, it motivates them to work hard, and 78% agreed that interactions with staff made the classes more enjoyable. With evidence that positive affect such as enjoyment is positively associated with aspects of learning, this is a salient finding. The study underscores the value of staff availability within the laboratory class and provides impetus to reevaluate how we perceive these interactions and their impact on student learning.

AB Students' course performance is fundamental for any institution to carry out its academic mission. Often, in-class disengagement and lack of after-class course support in large-enrollment classes trigger academic problems for students. This leads to poor exam performance and an increased rate of final letter grade of a D or F or student withdrawal (DFW), an indicator of students' poor academic success. Changing teaching strategies by using interventions that incorporate student-student interaction and student-faculty interaction may offer the opportunity to improve course performance. In this retrospective study, we examined the effect of changing teaching strategies on student course performance of 5,553 students enrolled in an undergraduate health sciences course over a span of 20 semesters. Three different interventions namely 1) daily low-stake in-class quizzes, 2) teambased learning, and 3) after-class review sessions were incorporated as teaching strategies. To assess the combined effect of these strategies' students' performance in the intervention period (12 semesters) was compared with control period (8 semesters). Student performance in the course was measured by exam grades; overall score; percentage of students receiving letter grades and A, B, C; and DFW rates. The data indicated that in the intervention period, exam scores increased by 6.6%, overall course score increased by 6.2%, percentage of students receiving letter grade A/B increased by 21.3%, percentage of students receiving letter grade C decreased by 6.9%, and the DFW rates decreased by 14.5%. Overall, changing teaching strategies through incorporation of these interventions improved students' performance in the course.

AB It is important for medical students to understand the relationship between nutrition, obesity, and diabetes to educate their patients in the future. However, medical training does not always include nutritional education. An experiential learning project was incorporated into the medical school curriculum as an effort to implement nutrition in the physiology course. First-year medical students (n = 140) received lectures on the regulation of blood glucose levels and their relationship to carbohydrates with different glycemic indexes (GI), obesity, and diabetes. Lectures were followed by a laboratory exercise where students calculated their body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, and percentage muscle using a Bioelectrical Impedance Commercial Scale. While 63% of students had normal BMI, 31% were overweight or obese and 5% were underweight. A subgroup of 54 students tested different types of breakfasts with varying GI and provided blood samples at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Their glucose responses were plotted based on the breakfast GI. Pre- and posttests were conducted to assess the teaching intervention where the Wilcoxon signed ranks test indicated that posttest ranks were significantly higher than pretest ranks (Z = -6.6, P < 0.001), suggesting the intervention was beneficial to students.

AB Function diagrams put the focus on physiology and physiological concepts rather than the associated anatomy. Function diagrams could potentially serve as an elaboration tool and memory aid (mnemonic) to improve learning and recall. The function diagram prototype of the gastrointestinal system can aid in the instruction of difficult gastrointestinal physiology topics using a sequential focus on fundamental gastrointestinal functions.

AB To reduce medication errors, medical educators must nurture the early development of rational and safe prescribing. Teaching pharmacology is challenging because it requires knowledge integration across disciplines, including physiology and pathology. Traditionally, pharmacology has been taught using lecture-based learning, which conveys consistent information but may promote passive learning. Virtual patients (VPs) have been used more recently to promote active learning, mainly in clinical years. Conversely, the use of VPs in preclinical disciplines, including pharmacology, is not well described. The objective was to investigate the potential benefits of combining traditional teaching with VPs in preclinical pharmacology teaching. All year 3 medical students (2 cohorts), enrolled in the Systematic Pharmacology I course (lectures: 3 h weekly; tutorial: 1 h weekly), were invited to participate in this naturalistic, prospective study. During tutorials, students were taught using case-based discussion and single-best-answer questions (control) in four tutorials and VPs (experimental) in the remaining six tutorials. The impact of VPs was assessed by 1) performance in written examinations, and 2) student satisfaction/perceptions, using a validated, modified questionnaire. Examination performance related to teaching in VP-based tutorials was significantly improved, compared with traditional tutorials. The level of difficulty of control and experimental assessment items was comparable, as determined by the Angoff method. Facilitation of learning was higher in VP tutorials, while a no-harm effect was noted on knowledge acquisition/maintenance, authenticity of learning, and disadvantages of learning. VPs may be effectively integrated in preclinical pharmacology teaching, with benefits on pharmacological knowledge and facilitation of learning.

AB Blood flow through the cardiovascular system is governed by the same physical rules that govern the flow of water through domestic plumbing. Using this analogy in a teaching laboratory, a model of the cardiovascular system constructed of pumps and pipes was used to demonstrate the basic interactions of pressure, flow, and resistance in a regulated system, with student volunteers providing the operational actions and regulatory components. The model was used to validate predictions and explore solutions prompted by student discussion. This interactive teaching laboratory provides an engaging experiential exercise that demonstrates regulation of flow and pressure in an intact cardiovascular system with apposite changes in heart rate and resistance. In addition, the system provides strong clinical correlates and illustrates how that regulated system responds to challenges such as heart failure, inappropriate vasodilation, and hemorrhage. The results demonstrate that, with limited practice, the instructor can effectively guide the students to reliably reproduce physiologically appropriate results.

AB As student populations become more diverse, it is essential for educators. administrators. and institutions to implement practices that ensure the success of all students. This is particularly true in the sciences, as students from traditionally underrepresented populations in S'I'EM compose an increasingly greater proportion of the national student demographic. The Teaching Section of the American Physiological Society sponsored a symposium. "Inclusive Practices for Diverse Student Populations," at 2017 Experimental Biology in Chicago, IL, introducing practices that promote inclusion in diverse student populations in STEM. The symposium began with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative assessment strategies of equity and inclusion. The second half of the symposium discussed structural bias and effective inclusive practices.

AB Our STEM majors arrive on campus as rule followers-" Tell me what to do, and I'll do it," is their refrain. To break this mindset, we redesigned our suite of laboratory courses to scaffold research throughout the program. Every laboratory incorporates both discipline-specific and research-specific skills. Foundational courses introduce research skills, leading to upper level student-driven research. This model should be extensible to any curriculum and makes research an integral part of the undergraduate career.

ID GROSS-ANATOMY; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT
AB Anatomy and physiology interactive video clips were introduced into a blended learning environment, as an optional resource, and were accessed by similar to 50% of the cohort. Student feedback indicated that clips were engaging, assisted understanding of course content, and provided lecture support. Students could also access two other optional online resources, lecture capture recordings and an interactive atlas of anatomy, and individuals were tracked with respect to their access behavior, learning approach, and subject score. Deep learning was highest among those accessing the clips or atlas or those accessing more online resources, and thus self-regulatory skill development might be a useful approach to increase student access to optional online resources. Those who accessed clips, lecture capture recordings, or atlas achieved a significantly higher subject score than those who did not. When combinations of resources used were considered, we found an approximately linear relationship between number of resources accessed and subject score, with a 16% difference in score between those who accessed none or all of the resources. However, the low resource access rate suggests that academic advantage may not be simply due to the learning support offered by the resources. As students accessing the optional resources tended to be more self-regulated, it may be that it was the extra effort made with respect to other subject resources, rather than just the access to the online resources, that contributed to higher subject score. Further studies are required to establish the relationships between academic performance, optional online resource access, and deep learning.

AB Sport science has gained vast popularity with students who have an interest in both physiology and the underpinning mechanisms of exercise concerning performance and health. The high numbers of graduates each year, coupled with the low number of graduate positions working in sports, has led to a high level of competition between students. To stand out from the crowd, sport science students may undertake an internship placement as part of their course, designed to enhance theoretical, practical, and soft skills in an applied setting. In the present article, we highlight some of the positives and negatives of sport science internships and ways in which they can be implemented and facilitated. Suggestions have also been provided to make students more aware of the reality of working in professional sports, which includes awareness of the potential for long and unsociable hours of work.

DE Frank-Starling law; undergraduate; teaching
AB This laboratory session provides hands-on experience for students to visualize the beating human heart with ultrasound imaging. Simple views are obtained from which students can directly measure important cardiac dimensions in systole and diastole. This allows students to derive, from first principles, important measures of cardiac function, such as stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. By repeating the measurements from a subject after a brief exercise period, an increase in stroke volume and ejection fraction are easily demonstrable, potentially with or without an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (which indicates preload). Thus, factors that affect cardiac performance can readily be discussed. This activity may be performed as a practical demonstration and visualized using an overhead projector or networked computers, concentrating on using the ultrasound images to teach basic physiological principles. This has proved to be highly popular with students, who reported a significant improvement in their understanding of Frank-Starling's law of the heart with ultrasound imaging.

ID MUSCLE
AB In the 19th century, the concept of experimental physiology originated in France with Claude Bernard, evolved in Germany stimulated by the teaching of Carl Ludwig, and later spread to Britain and then to the United States. The goal was to develop a physicochemical understanding of physiological phenomena. The first International Physiological Congress occurred in 1889 in Switzerland with an emphasis on experimental demonstrations. The XIIIth Congress, the first to be held outside of Europe, took place in Boston, MA, in 1929. It was a watershed meeting and indicated that American physiology had come of age. Meticulously organized, it was the largest congress to date, with over 1,200 participants from more than 40 countries. Getting to the congress was a cultural adventure, especially for the 400 scientists and their families from over 20 European countries, who sailed for 10 days on the S.S. Minnekahda. Many of the great physiologists of the world were in attendance, including 22 scientists who were either or would become Nobel Laureates. There were hundreds of platform presentations and many experimental demonstrations. The meeting was not without controversy as a conflict, still not completely settled, arose over the discovery of ATP. After the meeting, hundreds of participants made a memorable trip to the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA, which culminated in a "good old fashioned Cape Cod Clambake." Although not as spectacular as the 1929 congress, the physiological congresses have continued with goals similar to those established more than a century ago.

AB SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS, such physiology of filtration and absorption in the different nephron segments, are so detailed that they can be a challenge to be memorized. This article describes an exercise that solidifies learning as students manipulate, using paper models, "transporters" and "electrolytes" in the basolateral and luminal membranes of "nephron cells." Most important is the opportunity for the students to apply and test their own knowledge related to changes that occur in physiological processes, such as excess of salt or water intake or blood volume alterations, or pathology, such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, among many other applications.

   the role of heuristic evaluation

AB Optimizing the usability of e-learning materials is necessary to maximize their potential educational impact, but this is often neglected when time and other resources are limited, leading to the release of materials that cannot deliver the desired learning outcomes. As clinician-teachers in a resource-constrained environment, we investigated whether heuristic evaluation of our multimedia e-learning resource by a panel of experts would be an effective and efficient alternative to testing with end users. We engaged six inspectors, whose expertise included usability, e-learning, instructional design, medical informatics, and the content area of nephrology. They applied a set of commonly used heuristics to identify usability problems, assigning severity scores to each problem. The identification of serious problems was compared with problems previously found by user testing. The panel completed their evaluations within 1 wk and identified a total of 22 distinct usability problems, 11 of which were considered serious. The problems violated the heuristics of visibility of system status, user control and freedom, match with the real world, intuitive visual layout, consistency and conformity to standards, aesthetic and minimalist design, error prevention and tolerance, and help and documentation. Compared with user testing, heuristic evaluation found most, but not all, of the serious problems. Combining heuristic evaluation and user testing, with each involving a small number of participants, may be an effective and efficient way of improving the usability of e-learning materials. Heuristic evaluation should ideally be used first to identify the most obvious problems and, once these are fixed, should be followed by testing with typical end users.

AB Kaddam L, Elnimeiri MK. Students' perceived value of physiology course activities in a Sudanese medical faculty. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 298-301, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00070.2012.-The physiology course in our department consists of lectures, laboratory sessions, and tutorials, all of which are teacher centered, as well as student-led seminars. The overall aim of this project was to investigate student perceptions of the value of varying academic activities on their learning of physiology. A faculty-based descriptive study was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of Alneelain University (Khartoum, Sudan). Questionnaires (150 total) were distributed to students from the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, and Physiotherapy; 127 questionnaires were completed and returned. The results showed that 108 students (85%) believed that their absence from different academic activities could affect their performance. Students perceived lectures as the most valuable academic activity (90.7%), whereas seminars presented by students were perceived as the least important activity (18.5%). There was a significant correlation between lectures attendance and their performance in examinations (P = 0.008). Ninety percent of the students thought that teacher involvement in tutorials was essential and that lectures were useful to understand certain topics. These results showed that in our course, students perceived teacher involvement as a key component of the educational process.

AB Ozu M, Dorr RA, Gutierrez F, Politi MT, Toriano R. A counterpoint between computer simulations and biological experiments to train new members of a laboratory of physiological sciences. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 345-351, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00069.2012.-When new members join a working group dedicated to scientific research, several changes occur in the group's dynamics. From a teaching point of view, a subsequent challenge is to develop innovative strategies to train new staff members in creative thinking, which is the most complex and abstract skill in the cognitive domain according to Bloom's revised taxonomy. In this sense, current technological and digital advances offer new possibilities in the field of education. Computer simulation and biological experiments can be used together as a combined tool for teaching and learning sometimes complex physiological and biophysical concepts. Moreover, creativity can be thought of as a social process that relies on interactions among staff members. In this regard, the acquisition of cognitive abilities coexists with the attainment of other skills from psychomotor and affective domains. Such dynamism in teaching and learning stimulates teamwork and encourages the integration of members of the working group. A practical example, based on the teaching of biophysical subjects such as osmosis, solute transport, and membrane permeability, which are crucial in understanding the physiological concept of homeostasis, is presented.

AB Anyanwu GE, Agu AU, Anyaehie UB. Enhancing learning objectives by use of simple virtual microscopic slides in cellular physiology and histology: impact and attitudes. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 158-163, 2012; doi:10.1152/advan.00008.2012.-The impact and perception of students on the use of a simple, low technology-driven version of a virtual microscope in teaching and assessments in cellular physiology and histology were studied. Its impact on the time and resources of the faculty were also assessed. Simple virtual slides and conventional microscopes were used to conduct the same examinations for the same students. Students performed significantly better in the examination with the virtual slide and also showed a significantly higher preference for virtual slides. The time and cost implications of conducting examinations using the simple virtual slides were reduced by >1,400%. The results reemphasize the need for the design and adoption of simple sustainable technological innovations in developing countries to bridge gaps in purposeful learning environments.

AB Goswami N, Batzel JJ, Loeppky JA, Hinghofer-Szalkay H. Teaching fluid shifts during orthostasis using a classic paper by Foux et al. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 330-335, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00071.2011.-Hypovolemic and orthostatic challenge can be simulated in humans by the application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP), because this perturbation leads to peripheral blood pooling and, consequently, central hypovolemia. The classic paper by Foux and colleagues clearly shows the effects of orthostasis simulated by LBNP on fluid shifts and homeostatic mechanisms. The carefully carried out experiments reported in this paper show the interplay between different physiological control systems to ensure blood pressure regulation, failure of which could lead to critical decreases in cerebral blood flow and syncope. Here, a teaching seminar for graduate students is described that is designed in the context of this paper and aimed at allowing students to learn how Foux and colleagues have advanced this field by addressing important aspects of blood regulation. This seminar is also designed to put their research into perspective by including important components of LBNP testing and protocols developed in subsequent research in the field. Learning about comprehensive protocols and carefully controlled studies can reduce confounding variables and allow for an optimal analysis and elucidation of the physiological responses that are being investigated. Finally, in collaboration with researchers in mathematical modeling, in the future, we will incorporate the concepts of applicable mathematical models into our curriculum.

AB Sarikcioglu L, Senol Y, Yildirim FB, Hizay A. Correlation of the summary method with learning styles. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 290294, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00130.2010.-The summary is the last part of the lesson but one of the most important. We aimed to study the relationship between the preference of the summary method (video demonstration, question-answer, or brief review of slides) and learning styles. A total of 131 students were included in the present study. An inventory was prepared to understand the students' learning styles, and a satisfaction questionnaire was provided to determine the summary method selection. The questionnaire and inventory were collected and analyzed. A comparison of the data revealed that the summary method with video demonstration received the highest score among all the methods tested. Additionally, there were no significant differences between learning styles and summary method with video demonstration. We suggest that such a summary method should be incorporated into neuroanatomy lessons. Since anatomy has a large amount of visual material, we think that it is ideally suited for this summary method.

Adv Physiol Educ 35: 33-38, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00100.2010.-The purpose of the present study was to determine the coping strategies of medical students and to investigate the effects of coping strategies on student satisfaction and academic achievement with different instruction methods. A total of 152 medical students was followed throughout the first 2 yr of medical education between 2008 and 2010. Students completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and revised form of the Ways of Coping questionnaire both at the beginning of the first year and at the end of the second year. These forms provided data about the characteristics and main coping strategies (problem focused or emotion focused) of the students and revealed the change over time. At the end of the second year, participants also completed a satisfaction questionnaire asking their satisfaction with lectures, problem-based learning, and practicals. The authors used block, problem-based learning, and practical exam scores of the students attained in the past 2 yr as academic achievement indicators. No sociodemographic variable was related to coping strategy. The majority of students (80.9%) adopted problem-focused coping. A shift occurred in the main coping strategies of some students in both sides. Problem-focused coping scores decreased over time. Problem-focused coping positively correlated with satisfaction with practicals and practical exam scores, whereas emotion-focused coping showed the same correlation negatively. The main coping strategy also predicted satisfaction and exam success in practicals. In conclusion, a main coping strategy may be helpful to predict student satisfaction and academic achievement with some student-centered instruction methods. Determining undesired coping strategies may provide an opportunity for intervention to prevent relevant dissatisfaction and failure.

AB Overweight and obesity rates continue to rise and appear unlikely to abate. While physical activity (PA) is an important contribu-tor to health and successful weight maintenance, exercise science and health students (ESHS) often endorse negative weight status biases that could undermine PA promotion. This experiential learning activity was intended to help foster weight status understanding among ESHS. Nine ESHS completed the learning activity across two 75-minute class periods. During the initial di-dactic lesson, the instructor presented on psychophysiological responses to PA among normal and overweight individuals. During the second simulation lesson, the students first responded with their predictions of how the experience of four common physical activities, including shoe tying, brisk walking, running, and climbing and descending stairs, could differ with additional body mass. Next, students twice completed each of the four physical activities while first wearing a weighted vest that simulated 16 lb followed by 32 lb of additional mass. At the beginning, middle, and end of the stair climb and descent, the students pro-vided ratings of affective valence (i.e., pleasure-displeasure). Following the PA simulations, the students wrote about their experi-ences and how their PA promotion strategies could be modified for overweight clients. The changes in student qualitative responses, particularly following the 32-lb simulations, suggested an increased understanding of the psychophysiological experi-ence of PA while carrying additional mass. Learning activities like this one may be meaningful additions to ESHS curricula aiming to mitigate weight status bias and improve PA promotion among overweight clients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Exercise science and health students (ESHS) often enter the field with the noble intention to help people become more physically active. However, many ESHS endorse negative weight status biases that could undermine health pro-motion efforts among overweight individuals. Experiential learning simulations that approximate the experiences of physical ac-tivity while overweight may be helpful tools to foster understanding and reduce bias. This article outlines a two-part didactic/ simulation learning activity to promote weight status understanding among ESHS.

AB The past -15 years have seen increasing interest in defining disciplinary core concepts. Within the field of physiology, Michael, McFarland, Modell, and colleagues have published studies that defined physiology core concepts and have elaborated many of these as detailed conceptual frameworks. With such helpful definitions now in place, attention is turning to the related issue of how to maximize student understanding of the core concepts by linking these "big ideas" to concrete student-facing resources for active learning and assessment. Our practitioner-based view begins with the recognition that in many if not most undergradu-ate physiology courses assessment drives learning. We have therefore linked published conceptual frameworks to Test Question Templates (TQTs), whose structure promotes transparent assessments as well as the active learning needed to pre-pare for such assessments. We provide examples of conceptual framework-linked TQTs for the physiology core concepts of Homeostasis, Flow Down Gradients, the Cell Membrane, and Cell-Cell Communication. We argue that this deployment of TQTs has at least two distinct benefits for the teaching and learning of core concepts. First, documenting the connections between conceptual frameworks and TQTs may clarify coverage and assessment of the core concepts for both instructors and students. Second, misconceptions about core concepts may be directly targeted and dispelled via thoughtful construction, arrangement, and iteration of TQTs. We propose that the TQT framework or similar approaches may be applied fruitfully to any sufficiently articulated physiology core concept for high school, undergraduate, or graduate students. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our students often focus on the grades they need to advance through academic programs. How can instructors harness this understandable interest in grades to help students gain a true understanding of core concepts? The new framework of Test Question Templates (TQTs) shows promise in linking student priorities like test scores to instructor priorities like core concepts.

AB The competency-based undergraduate medical curriculum in the preclinical years requires clinical topics to be taught using a linker clinical case for students to appreciate the clinical application of basic sciences. The objective of this study was to evalu-ate student and faculty satisfaction regarding the construct and delivery of an aligned and integrated curriculum that involved the use of linker clinical cases. We aimed at evaluating the perceptions and performance of students when paper cases were supplemented with a simulated patient (SP) video. This interventional study was conducted by inviting 250 medical students from the first professional phase from the 2020-2021 batch. Integrated modules were prepared for two clinical conditions: myo-cardial infarction (MI) and nephrotic syndrome (NS). The topic NS was taught with a paper-based case while the topic MI was supplemented with an SP video. Feedback from students and faculty was collected using a newly developed and validated questionnaire and focused group discussions. The students performed significantly better in the assessment conducted after the topic MI compared to NS. The majority of the students (80%) expressed a preference for the video to understand the clinical relevance when compared to the paper case. Overall, the students (83-87%) expressed satisfaction with integrated teaching sessions using clinical cases. Using linker clinical cases in an aligned and integrated preclinical curriculum allowed students to interrelate the subjects and apply them to clinical contexts. The SP videos prepared from an authentic setting facilitated learner engagement with a better understanding of the clinical relevance of the basic sciences.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we have introduced linker cases to teach clinical correlation of basic sciences for inte-grated modules in the competency-based undergraduate medical curriculum. The novelty of our study is the inclusion of simu-lated patient video that was internally prepared and validated to supplement linker clinical paper cases in integrated modules.

AB In September of 2020, a group of dental students (DDS) and motivated faculty at the University of Western Ontario came to-gether in response to the pandemic and established a real-time feedback model. The goal of this model was to address techni-cal challenges following the quick transition from in-person courses to a fully online format for student learning. This initial offering formed the foundation of the Students as Partners (SaP) program to identify and address technical and curricular issues. We used an action research approach to evaluate and refine the innovation's delivery. Preliminary data from the first cycle sug-gested that students were unaware of the impact of their feedback and the actionable items from their feedback. Thus, for the second iteration we focused on making the entire process more transparent by using Padlet as a way to streamline posting and responding to feedback. To evaluate the refined system, we distributed surveys to student and faculty participants to obtain feedback on their awareness and satisfaction and effectiveness of the program. For students who utilized the system, the major-ity indicated that they were informed of changes based on their feedback. Furthermore, students reported that our innovation provided a platform for the student voice. Faculty impressions were generally positive, and the majority of faculty respondents indicated that they implemented changes to their content/curriculum based on feedback. These results demonstrate that the SaP program's real-time feedback system closed the feedback loop and facilitated real-time improvements based on actionable feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first study to design, implement, and evaluate a real-time feedback system for the pur-pose of modifying how an instructor teaches.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Course feedback surveys at the end of term infrequently result in beneficial change. However, student feed-back should be considered to develop meaningful learning. In response to this problem, we report on a novel Students as Partners innovation to address instructional issues in real time with a virtual bulletin board application embedded in the learning management system. Students and instructors valued the system's ability to close the feedback loop and provide transparent, actionable change.

AB Collaborative teaching strategies such as peer instruction and conventional group work have previously been shown to enhance meaningful learning, but they have not previously been compared. In this present study, we compared the impact of solving quizzes with peer instruction and conventional group work on immediate learning in a laboratory exercise. A total of 186 second-year medical students were randomized to solve two quizzes by either a peer instruction strategy (n = 93) or conventional group work (n = 93) during a mandatory laboratory exercise on respiratory physiology, after which all students completed an individual test. There was no difference in total test scores between groups, but students randomized to peer instruction obtained the highest test scores in solving simple integrated questions. Conversely, students randomized to conventional group work provided the best evaluations of the overall assessment of the laboratory exercise. In conclusion, different collaborative teaching strategies implemented during a laboratory exercise appear to affect immediate learning and student satisfaction differently.

AB This paper presents the description and analysis of a didactic experience involving the participation of a university and a community school, developed as part of the National Science and Technology Week, at a public university in northeastern Brazil. For this purpose, the use of learning station rotation enabled innovation in the teaching of physiology integrated with biochemistry and health education contents. The didactic approach consisted of creating a learning circuit comprising seven stations. The central theme of the stations emphasized physiology, with specific foci on biochemistry and cardiorespiratory and endocrine health. Each station provided unique activities related to the central theme, including a station concerning digital technology in physiology. The school students were divided into small groups (6 or 7 people) that rotated through the stations, with a total of 81 students visiting each station. A qualitative assessment was performed using a Likert-scale questionnaire to measure the level of satisfaction of the students. It was found that this didactic approach increased the receptivity of the students to the contents, facilitated student-teacher dialogue, and provided an excellent tool for establishing an interface between the university and the community school. Overall, 76.5% of the students rated the activity as excellent.

AB Before COVID-19, the use of case studies to learn science was well established in high school and postsecondary classrooms. Once the pandemic ensued, many faculty continued to use the method as a way to infuse elements of active learning remotely. The results of a survey taken by 600 faculty reveal how they accomplished this feat. Respondents to the survey found that the case method readily transferred to online learning. Most used a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous classrooms. Serious challenges were encountered, primarily due to the difficulty instructors had in keeping track of learner participation. Many obstacles were overcome by creative strategies such as using Google Forms. Some semblance of a normal classroom was achieved by using online conferencing tools and using small groups in synchronous breakout rooms. Cases were commonly broken into chunks and spread over several days. This worked especially well with cases that were already structured this way, including interrupted cases and problem-based learning exercises. Assessment of student performance largely followed the traditional path of exams, projects, and essays, although a third of the faculty attempted to evaluate participation. Classes conducted via an asynchronous approach were largely lecture based, with cases given to learners to complete as homework either individually or as groups. The greatest challenge in this setting was that answers to case questions were often readily available to learners on the internet. This was avoided by faculty modifying questions or creating their own.

AB The Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed serious restrictions for academic institutions to maintain their research and teaching practical subjects. Universities have implemented adaptive measures to maintain educational activities and achieve the learning objectives for undergraduate and postgraduate students by shifting to online teaching and learning. Although such approaches have enabled delivering the theoretical content of courses during the pandemic, universities have faced serious difficulties in running practicals with actual research experiments and teaching hand-on skills because such activities potentially override the required safety guidelines. Here, we report an adaptive measure, implemented at Monash University, to run home-based studies in cognitive neuroscience and achieve learning objectives, which are normally delivered in face-to-face practicals. We introduce two specifically designed short-term research projects and describe how different aspects of these projects, such as tutorials, experiments, and assessments, were modified to meet the required social distancing. The results of cognitive tests were closely comparable between the laboratory-based and home-based experiments indicating that students followed the guidelines and the required procedures for a reliable data collection. Our assessments of students' performance and feedback indicate that the majority of our educational goals were achieved, while all safety guidelines and distancing requirements were also met.

AB The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the primary diagnostic tool in cardiovascular diseases. Hence its interpretation is a core competency in medicine, where obvious deficiencies have been reported among learners. The aim of this study was to introduce the fundamentals of ECG knowledge and interpretation through early clinical exposure (ECE) based on a six-step approach for preclinical students (n = 110) and to study its influence on their knowledge and interpretation skills thereafter. The first step employed a blended learning format using didactic lectures on normal and pathological ECGs, each preceded by preinstructional videos. The second step focused on psychomotor skills and utilized laboratory exercises for ECG recording and interpretation. The third step focused on vertical integration, where the clinical relevance of the procedure was established with integrated lectures. The fourth step used the Moodle platform, where opportunities for peer interactions and clarifications by clinical faculty were made available. The fifth step incorporated clinical and diagnostic reasoning through cardiology ward visits and interpretation of patient ECGs. The sixth step was designed for critical thinking and problem solving through case-based discussions with peers and faculty. Students were assessed with multiple-choice questions and objective structured practical examination. Learner perceptions of the approach were evaluated with a feedback questionnaire and focus group discussion. Statistical analysis showed that ECE through a six-step approach significantly enhanced knowledge and interpretation of ECG as evidenced by the pre- and posttest scores. Analysis of the focus group data revealed that learner engagement and skills of critical thinking were enhanced along with diagnostic and clinical reasoning.

AB The introduction of Competency-Based Medical Education Curriculum in India has endorsed many new concepts, like foundation course, self-directed learning (SDL), early clinical exposure, etc. Emphasis is being given to active teaching-learning approaches. One such approach is SDL. SDL is an active learning approach in which the students are responsible for their own learning outcome, with teacher acting as a facilitator of learning. A medical graduate, being a lifelong learner, should inculcate the habit of SDL. In the present study, the SDL abilities of first year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students were assessed using a questionnaire. Based on their experience, students were also asked about the prerequisites of SDL, how it can be promoted, and their expectations from the teachers. Students scored high in most of the SDL skills. However, they felt they need improvement in time management. Furthermore, the students are required to develop their interpersonal communication skills, and they also find it difficult to express messages effectively in oral presentations. Most of the students felt they need help in finding the correct learning resources. According to them, the students should be focused, motivated and stress-free, have time management skills, and be able to search learning resources for successful implementation of SDL. They felt that events that encourage active participation by students, if organized at regular intervals, could promote SDL. Some felt that evaluation of SDL would motivate them to take it seriously. According to the students, teacher should act as a facilitator, a mentor, as well as an evaluator.
